0,Alyssa Milano Says She Needs ‘More Evidence’ on Whether or Not Biden Accuser Is ‘Credible’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/alyssa-milano-says-she-needs-more-evidence-on-whether-or-not-biden-accuser-is-credible/,"Hollywood actor and Democratic activist Alyssa Milano said that she wants “more evidence” to determine if a sexual misconduct charge against Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden is “credible.”
A woman named Tara Reade, who worked for then-Sen. Biden in the 1990s, claims he sexually assaulted her in 1993. There were no witnesses, she says, and so she didn’t go public with the allegations, which Biden has denied.
Although a few outlets have published stories about the charges, including Salon, The Intercept and Democracy Now, most mainstream news organizations have largely ignored the story.
Meanwhile, questions have come up to call Reade’s veracity into question, including her expressed devotion to Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin.
“It’s got to be fair in both directions. So, you know, I’ve been very vocal about Biden and my support for him. I’ve known him for a long time and I did do my due diligence because part of it was that — the article that sort of stood out to me was that Time’s Up decided not to take the case,” Milano said in an interview, referring to the legal organization which assists victims of sexual misconduct. “I did my work and I spoke to Time’s Up and I just don’t feel comfortable throwing away a decent man that I’ve known for 15 years in this time of complete chaos without there being a thorough investigation.
“I’m sure that mainstream media would be jumping all over this as well if, they found more evidence or through their [reporting]— so I’m just kind of staying quiet about it,” she added.
Others, including Milano’s former co-star on the TV series Charmed, Rose McGowan, have been criticizing Milano for her stance on the matter.
“They’re calling me hypocritical for, you know, and saying that I’m a fake feminist and all of this, all of this stuff, and I’m still trying desperately to stand back and be sort of objective about this because I don’t want this to — you know, I sent the Me Too tweet over two years ago,” Milano said. “I never thought that it would be something that was going to destroy innocent men, right? Like, we don’t want that to happen either.
“So we have to find this balance in the ‘believe women’ movement and also giving men their their due process and, you know, realizing that we’re destroying lives if we publicly don’t go through the right steps in order to find out if an accusation is credible or not,” Milano added.

1,Gov. Cuomo: ‘There Is a Real Danger in Getting Overconfident Too Quickly’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/gov-cuomo-there-is-a-real-danger-in-getting-overconfident-too-quickly/,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said that he understands the economic toll that lockdowns and social distancing are taking, but even if the rate of infection in the state is starting to drop, it’s too early for residents to let their guard down.
There have been more than 1.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 74,000.
In the United States, there have been 380,698, including 11,902 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
The area in and around New York has been the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States.
“One of the reasons the rate of infection is going down is because social distancing is working. We have to continue the social distancing,” Cuomo said. “Schools and nonessential businesses will stay closed until April 29. I know that’s a negative for many, many reasons. I know what it does to the economy. But as I said from Day One, I’m not going to choose between public health and economic activity.
“Because in either event, public health still demands that we stay on pause with businesses closed and schools closed. Whether we’ve hit the apex, or whether we haven’t hit the apex, you’d have to do the same thing,” Cuomo added. “There’s also a real danger in getting overconfident too quickly. This is an enemy we have underestimated from Day One, and we have paid the price dearly. Well the numbers may be turning: Yay, it’s over. No, it’s not.
“Other places have made that mistake. Hong Kong has made the mistake, South Korea has made that mistake. We are not going to make that mistake,” the governor said. “The weather is turning, people have been locked up, we’ve been talking about cabin fever. Now it’s a nice day, I’m going to go out, I’m going to take a walk. Now is not the time to do that. Frankly, there has been a laxness on social distancing, especially over this past weekend, that is just wholly unacceptable.
“Look, people are dying. People in the health care system are exposing themselves every day to tremendous risk, walking into those emergency rooms. And then they have to go home to their family and wonder if they caught the virus, and they’re bringing it it home to their family. If you don’t — if I can’t convince you to show discipline for yourself, then show discipline for other people,” Cuomo said. “If you get infected, you infect someone else, you go to an emergency room, you put a burden on all sorts of other people you don’t know and who, frankly, you don’t have the right to burden with your irresponsibility.
“And people, especially in New York City, the level of activity is up. Partially the weather, a nice day, I understand. People have been locked up for a long time. But now is not the time to be lax,” he added. “And it is a mistake. We all have a responsibility. We all have a role in this. We said that from Day One.”

2,Dr. Fauci: Going Back To Pre-Coronavirus Life ‘Might Not Ever Happen’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/dr-fauci-going-back-to-pre-coronavirus-life-might-not-ever-happen/,"Life will probably never get back to exactly how it was before the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, society will “gradually” find its way to a new normal, according to Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading American immunologist who heads up the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
There have been more than 1.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 74,000.
In the United States, there have been 380,698, including 11,902 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
“Well, Jon, if back to normal means acting like there never was a coronavirus problem, I don’t think that’s going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population. But when we say getting back to normal, we mean something very different from what we are going through right now,” Dr Fauci said during an appearance on Fox News. “Because right now we are in a very intense mitigation. When we get back to normal, we will go back gradually to the point where we can function as a society.
“But you’re absolutely right. If you want to get to pre-coronavirus, that might not ever happen in the sense of the fact that the threat is there, but I believe with the therapies that will be coming online, with the fact that I feel confident that over a period of time we will get a good vaccine, that we will never have to get to back to where we are now,” he added. “So if that means getting back to normal, then we will get back to normal.”

3,Meghan McCain: I’m Fearful ‘Totalitarian’ Trump Will Try Pandemic Power Grab,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/meghan-mccain-im-fearful-totalitarian-trump-will-try-pandemic-power-grab/,"A prominent conservative commentator on television has voiced her concerns that Donald Trump will use the coronavirus pandemic as a means for an authoritarian power grab.
Like the rest of the world, the United States is reeling from the effects of coronavirus, the mass deaths caused by the COVID-19 disease and the economic fallout from the extreme lockdown and social distancing measures most of the nation is under in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.
“So I think the point you’re making, Sunny, about the [Trump] press conferences, because there is an argument that’s being made by some people in media that the press conferences shouldn’t be being covered at all, and my argument for keeping the press conferences is I think we’re at a place where President Trump, he has always been a sort of totalitarian president in a way that we’ve never historically seen before. And my fear is that he’s going to play on the American public’s fears in a draconian way, and possibly do something akin to the Patriot Act going forward where he uses this moment in time to play off our fears for his own benefit,” Meghan McCain said in conversation on the daily TV talk show which she co-hosts. “And I think seeing front and center what him and his team — I for one, became even more fearful of what was happening when I saw how inept [Trump son-in-law and adviser] Jared Kushner was.
“So I think while he has a team of doctors like Dr. Fauci that we’re all in agreement is doing a great job, my fear is that is moment in time that can be manipulated by our powers, and by the government in place, and I want to see front and center what he’s saying, no matter how ridiculous some of the press conference commentary ebbs into,” McCain added.

4,"Former Congresswoman: $500B in Coronavirus Relief Package Managed By Treasury, May Go to Trump’s Cronies",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/former-congresswoman-500b-in-coronavirus-relief-package-managed-by-treasury-may-go-to-trumps-cronies/,"The $500 billion contained in the $2 trillion economic stimulus package Congress recently approved which is to be managed by the Treasury Department will require effective oversight, according to a former Democratic congresswoman.
The recent stimulus is an attempt to rescue an economy in freefall, as much of the American people are observing lockdown and social distancing measures to try to slow the spread of the virus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic. So far, a record 10 million Americans have reported unemployment, and the US economy could take a 30 percent hit.
Within the stimulus package is $500 billion which is to be managed at the discretion of the federal Treasury Department.
That’s opened up worry about Donald Trump directing the funds be used for corrupt purposes.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has established a new committee specifically tasked with oversight of disbursement of those funds.
“But what’s important is that the $2 trillion rescue package, which blows a hole for generations in our deficit and debt, be managed properly. And that’s what she’s trying to do,” former Rep. Jane Harman (D-Calif) said, referring to Pelosi. “Yes, there is an oversight committee chaired by Carolyn Maloney, who was elected to Congress when I was in 1992 and she’s very able, but Pelosi’s trying to focus on a way to tunnel all the brain cells on this one problem.
“Whether she’ll succeed, I don’t know, but it is important that there be oversight,” said Harman, who served two stints in Congress, the second ending in 2011. “Five hundred billion dollars in this $2 trillion bill are managed by the Treasury Department and they may go to [Trump’s] cronies.”

5,Trump’s Cheerleading for Hydroxychloroquine ‘Is a Little bit Dangerous’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trumps-cheerleading-for-hydroxychloroquine-is-a-little-bit-dangerous/,"Donald Trump continues to push a treatment for COVID-19 on the American people which even Trump’s own top immunologist has put the brakes on. In fact, Trump has taken to advocating for the use of the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine while preventing Dr Anthony Fauci to speak about it from the briefing room apparently for fear of being contradicted.
Although hydroxychloroquine has been prescribed for decades to combat malaria, some have also sworn to be cured of deadly cases of COVID-19 after treatment with the drug.
Trump, who has become publicly tired of the extreme lockdown conditions that much of the United States is under in order to try to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, has become one of loudest cheerleaders for the use of hydroxychloroquine, although, in the same breath, he admits that he is no physician.
“Because I want people to live and I’m seeing people dying. I’ve seen people that are going to die without it,” Trump said Sunday. “And you know the expression. When that’s happening, they should do it. What really do we have to lose? We also have — this medicine’s been tested for many years for malaria and for lupus, so it’s been out there. It is a very strong powerful medicine, but it doesn’t kill people. We have some very good results and some very good tests.
“You’ve seen the same tests that I have. In France, they had a very good test. They’re continuing,” Trump added. “But we don’t have time to go and say, ‘Gee, let’s take a couple of years and test it out, and let’s go and test with the test tubes in the laboratories.’ We don’t have time. I’d love to do that, but we have people dying today.“
CNN White House correspondent Jeremy Diamond pointed out on-air that Dr Fauci couldn’t respond when Trump spoke up in favor of hydroxychloroquine.
“Fauci, of course, has been on the record talking about this drug saying there’s not yet conclusive proof this drug is effective in the treatment of coronavirus,” Diamond said. “But I think it’s especially notable when you see the president there acknowledging earlier in the day that he is not a doctor as he doles out this advice about this hydroxychloroquine drug. And then when you actually see a doctor at the podium, the top government expert on infectious diseases, it’s notable that the president won’t let him speak.”
CNN’s medical analyst, Dr. Jennifer Lee, said that while it’s natural for people to want a solution in a crisis, Trump’s advocacy for such an unproven drug is unhelpful.
“Well, you know, when you’re faced with a virus like this that is so new and so deadly and dangerous, I can understand why one would look for drugs for hope in treating and battling the virus. But it is too soon and a little bit dangerous, I would say, to be encouraging people to use hydroxychloroquine, also known as plaquenil and azithromycin, so widely,” said Dr Lee, clinical associate professor of emergency medicine at The George Washington University.
“You know, one thing I would say is as a physician, seeing COVID patients, we already have these drugs available to us. And if someone really needed it, of course we would try everything possible to save them, to help them,” she said. “So, I do think it is not necessarily helpful to be telling the general public to go out and try this because, again, the data is not there. It’s not proven yet. There are many trials right now that are looking at it. And we hope and pray that we’ll see the good scientific evidence that it works. But until then, I think people can feel comfortable that doctors know that they have this in their arsenal to use when they need it.
“But the general public does not need to feel like they have to go out and get these drugs and hoard them or store them up for use because it’s really not for mild symptoms right now,” Dr Lee said.
Dr Fauci also addressed the matter of hydroxychloroquine in an interview with Margaret Brennan, host of the CBS News program Face the Nation.
“You know, as I’ve said many times, Margaret, the data are really just at best suggestive. There have been cases that show there may be an effect and there are others to show there’s no effect,” he said. “So I think in terms of science, I don’t think we could definitively say it works.”

6,"Dr. Fauci: Unless We Get Coronavirus Under Control, Chance It Will Become Seasonal",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/coronavirus/dr-fauci-unless-we-get-coronavirus-under-control-chance-it-will-become-seasonal/,"US, and global, public health professionals are pushing so hard to get the novel coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic under control, because there’s a chance that the deadly disease could become a seasonal threat, according to Dr Anthony Fauci, the top American immunologist who is a member of the federal coronavirus task force.
There have been more than 1.2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 69,000.
In the United States, there have been 338,999 cases reported, including 9,687 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
Public health professionals have been advocating extreme lockdowns and social distancing to try to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, which many US mayors and governors have been enacting.
This has kept many Americans out of restaurants, bars, theaters and many types of retail establishments–wherever crowds could gather.
“Unless we get this globally under control, there’s a very good chance that it will assume a seasonal nature in the sense that even if we, and I hope it’s not just if–but when–we get it down to the point where it really is at a very low level, we need to be prepared that since it unlikely will be completely eradicated from the planet, that as we get into next season, we may see the beginning of a resurgence,” Dr Fauci said. “And that’s the reason why we’re pushing so hard and getting our preparedness much better than it was, but importantly, pushing on a vaccine and doing clinical trials for therapeutic interventions so that hopefully if in fact we do see that resurgence, we will have interventions that we did not have in the beginning of the situation that we’re in right now.”

7,"Joe Biden Calls for Second and Third CARES Act, Possibly More",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/joe-biden-calls-for-second-and-third-cares-act-possibly-more/,"On Sunday former vice president Joe Biden, in an interview on ABC’s This Week, emphasized the importance of acting fast and taking measures to flatten the curve amid the pandemic. He also called for more iterations of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Biden’s comments come after President Donald Trump stated that the response to combat the spread of the virus should not “be worse than the problem itself.” Trump has repeatedly resisted declaring a nationwide stay at home order despite facing criticism and mounting pressure from public health experts. He claims that doing so would shut down the economy and thus severely damage the United States, resulting in businesses closing, people losing their jobs and strains on financial markets.

While Trump did recently extend the 15-day social distancing period to 30 days, following the guidelines for this is still voluntary.
However, it is important to be aware that Trump’s power is a lot more limited compared to other countries. Even though Trump declared a national emergency, due to the federalist system, governors have primary authority over handling lockdown measures in their states.
This Week host George Stephanopoulos asked Biden if he was concerned about Trump’s fear that “the cure is going to be worse than the disease,” and “isn’t there a point there that, if this lockdown goes on for too long, the public health concerns could be — could be grave?”
“Well, the public health concerns can be grave. And you saw what’s happening in Singapore. They moved very rapidly to bring down the coronavirus down to zero, and then they began to open up,” Biden said. “They had very, very tight restrictions in terms of social distancing, et cetera, staying in place. Now it’s coming back.”
On Apr. 5, Singapore confirmed 120 new coronavirus cases, the largest reported daily increase so far. Singapore currently has around 1,300 confirmed cases.
“We have to take all the efforts we can to make sure we prevent the spread, lower that curve as they talk about, and move from there,” Biden added.

Lowering the curve refers to slowing the speed of transmission, so cases occur over a gradual, longer period of time rather than a sudden surge that could overwhelm the healthcare system. Not only will this result in fewer deaths as all patients can be properly cared for, but it buys time to develop a vaccine as well, which Biden stressed is needed “most of all.”
During the interview, Biden also criticized Trump’s handling of the outbreak, telling Stephanopoulos that he is acting too slowly despite speed being vital in flattening the curve.
“You have to move swiftly. And we have to move more rapidly. You have to implement the Defense Production Act, empower a supply commander, create a Defense Production Act for banks that get out small business loans, ramp up testing, a whole range of things. You got to go faster than slower. And we started off awfully slow,” Biden explained.
Stephanopoulos questioned if Biden was suggesting that Trump was at fault for the rapidly rising case numbers and death toll in the United States.
“Well, look, what I have been saying is that he’s moving too slow. The virus is not his fault, but the response is his responsibility,” Biden remarked.
Biden then addressed that while the recent “CARES Act that the congress passed…did a great deal” at least “two more iterations of that” will be needed to “help the economy.”
His belief is similarly shared by others such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who last Friday said, “right now, I think we have a good model; it was bipartisan, it was signed by the president, but it’s not enough.”
The United States now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, at approximately 320,000, and this number continues to drastically grow.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, a coronavirus task force team member, said today that they are “struggling to get it under control,” and he warned, “things are going to get bad and we need to be prepared for that.” Yet, he noted that “we should hope that within a week, maybe a little bit more, we’ll start to see a flattening out of the curve, and coming down.”

8,3M CEO: ‘Narrative That We Are Not Doing Everything To Maximize Respirators in Our Home Country Is False’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/3m-ceo-narrative-that-we-are-not-doing-everything-to-maximize-respirators-in-our-home-country-is-false/,"Despite fierce criticism from Donald Trump and others that the multinational 3M is not doing enough to produce critical medical supplies like N95 respirators, that’s the furthest thing from the truth, according to the corporate giant’s CEO, Mike Roman.
3M has come under fire for not providing enough gear, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), to US medical providers, while selling those supplies freely overseas.
There have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 58,000.
In the United States, there have been 311,637 reported cases, including 8,454 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
Governors and mayors across the country have been reporting being short of needed medical supplies in the battle against the pandemic, particularly recently in the region in and around New York.
“Let me start with this, you know, the narrative that we are not doing everything to maximize respirators in our own country is false. Nothing could be further from the truth, and I’m happy to talk about that,” Roman said during an appearance on the Fox Business Network. “The idea, the other idea that 3M is not doing all it can to fight price gouging, unauthorized reselling is absurd. We are doing everything we can to fight COVID-19 and support the health care workers here at home. But it’s just, it — and, you know, up until yesterday we had been really proud of all the things we were doing and hearing from every direction save a few negative narratives. But the narratives out there, they’re just not true.”
Further, slamming the Maplewood, Minn.-based 3M for making equipment available overseas doesn’t comprehend the global nature of the pandemic, Roman said.
“Well, it’s been a focus of the Defense Production Act, I would say that we’ve been telling the administration for days and days, and it’s important to understand that, we’re happy to shift our overseas production to the U.S.,” he said, referring to a Korean War-era law which Trump has invoked to give him power over the US private sector. “We’re already a net importer. But there are consequences, as you highlighted.
“We are often the sole provider for health care workers in many cubs, and — in many countries, and that was the way we built out this capability, to be able to support them,” Roman added. “There will be consequences. They will not have access to products, and they’re in the middle of the fight too.”

9,Gov. Cuomo Says NY Now Only 4 to 8 Days From COVID-19 Peak but ‘We’re Not Yet Ready’ for It,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/gov-cuomo-says-ny-now-only-4-to-8-days-from-covid-19-peak-but-were-not-yet-ready-for-it/,"The New York area, which has been dealing with most of the cases of COVID-19 in the United States, will likely reach the apex of the region’s pandemic within days–but the state’s still not ready, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).
There have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 58,000. 
In the United States, there have been 311,637 reported cases, including 8,454 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
The area around New York has become the epicenter for COVID-19 illness in the United States.
“We’re tracking the growth of the number of infections by hospital, and we can see just where the numbers are increasing. We’ve been talking about hitting the apex,” Cuomo said. “The apex is the point where the number of infections on a daily basis is at the high point that is the ultimate challenge I call it the battle of the mountaintop. That will be the Number One point of the engagement of the enemy.
“By the numbers we’re not at the apex. We’re getting closer, depending on whose model you’ll look at. They’ll say four, five, six seven days, some people go out 14 days but our reading of the projections is we’re somewhere in the seven-day range, four, five, six day range,” he added. “Nobody can give you a specific number, which makes it frustrating to plan when you don’t have a specific number or date, but we’re in that range. We’re not yet at the apex, but part of me says it’s good we’re not at the apex, because we’re not yet ready.”
The state’s been running short on needed medical equipment like ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gowns which medical professionals require.
Cuomo just signed an executive order designed to confiscate ventilators and PPE from hospitals where they are not used and deliver them to those where they are.

This Week host George Stephanopoulos asked Biden if he was concerned about Trump’s fear that “the cure is going to be worse than the disease,” and “isn’t there a point there that, if this lockdown goes on for too long, the public health concerns could be — could be grave?”
“Well, the public health concerns can be grave. And you saw what’s happening in Singapore. They moved very rapidly to bring down the coronavirus down to zero, and then they began to open up,” Biden said. “They had very, very tight restrictions in terms of social distancing, et cetera, staying in place. Now it’s coming back.”
On Apr. 5, Singapore confirmed 120 new coronavirus cases, the largest reported daily increase so far. Singapore currently has around 1,300 confirmed cases.
“We have to take all the efforts we can to make sure we prevent the spread, lower that curve as they talk about, and move from there,” Biden added.

Lowering the curve refers to slowing the speed of transmission, so cases occur over a gradual, longer period of time rather than a sudden surge that could overwhelm the healthcare system. Not only will this result in fewer deaths as all patients can be properly cared for, but it buys time to develop a vaccine as well, which Biden stressed is needed “most of all.”
During the interview, Biden also criticized Trump’s handling of the outbreak, telling Stephanopoulos that he is acting too slowly despite speed being vital in flattening the curve.
“You have to move swiftly. And we have to move more rapidly. You have to implement the Defense Production Act, empower a supply commander, create a Defense Production Act for banks that get out small business loans, ramp up testing, a whole range of things. You got to go faster than slower. And we started off awfully slow,” Biden explained.
Stephanopoulos questioned if Biden was suggesting that Trump was at fault for the rapidly rising case numbers and death toll in the United States.
“Well, look, what I have been saying is that he’s moving too slow. The virus is not his fault, but the response is his responsibility,” Biden remarked.
Biden then addressed that while the recent “CARES Act that the congress passed…did a great deal” at least “two more iterations of that” will be needed to “help the economy.”
His belief is similarly shared by others such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who last Friday said, “right now, I think we have a good model; it was bipartisan, it was signed by the president, but it’s not enough.”
The United States now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world, at approximately 320,000, and this number continues to drastically grow.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, a coronavirus task force team member, said today that they are “struggling to get it under control,” and he warned, “things are going to get bad and we need to be prepared for that.” Yet, he noted that “we should hope that within a week, maybe a little bit more, we’ll start to see a flattening out of the curve, and coming down.”

12,3M CEO: ‘Narrative That We Are Not Doing Everything To Maximize Respirators in Our Home Country Is False’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/3m-ceo-narrative-that-we-are-not-doing-everything-to-maximize-respirators-in-our-home-country-is-false/,"Despite fierce criticism from Donald Trump and others that the multinational 3M is not doing enough to produce critical medical supplies like N95 respirators, that’s the furthest thing from the truth, according to the corporate giant’s CEO, Mike Roman.
3M has come under fire for not providing enough gear, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), to US medical providers, while selling those supplies freely overseas.
There have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 58,000.
In the United States, there have been 311,637 reported cases, including 8,454 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
Governors and mayors across the country have been reporting being short of needed medical supplies in the battle against the pandemic, particularly recently in the region in and around New York.
“Let me start with this, you know, the narrative that we are not doing everything to maximize respirators in our own country is false. Nothing could be further from the truth, and I’m happy to talk about that,” Roman said during an appearance on the Fox Business Network. “The idea, the other idea that 3M is not doing all it can to fight price gouging, unauthorized reselling is absurd. We are doing everything we can to fight COVID-19 and support the health care workers here at home. But it’s just, it — and, you know, up until yesterday we had been really proud of all the things we were doing and hearing from every direction save a few negative narratives. But the narratives out there, they’re just not true.”
Further, slamming the Maplewood, Minn.-based 3M for making equipment available overseas doesn’t comprehend the global nature of the pandemic, Roman said.
“Well, it’s been a focus of the Defense Production Act, I would say that we’ve been telling the administration for days and days, and it’s important to understand that, we’re happy to shift our overseas production to the U.S.,” he said, referring to a Korean War-era law which Trump has invoked to give him power over the US private sector. “We’re already a net importer. But there are consequences, as you highlighted.
“We are often the sole provider for health care workers in many cubs, and — in many countries, and that was the way we built out this capability, to be able to support them,” Roman added. “There will be consequences. They will not have access to products, and they’re in the middle of the fight too.”

13,Gov. Cuomo Says NY Now Only 4 to 8 Days From COVID-19 Peak but ‘We’re Not Yet Ready’ for It,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/gov-cuomo-says-ny-now-only-4-to-8-days-from-covid-19-peak-but-were-not-yet-ready-for-it/,"The New York area, which has been dealing with most of the cases of COVID-19 in the United States, will likely reach the apex of the region’s pandemic within days–but the state’s still not ready, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).
There have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 58,000. 
In the United States, there have been 311,637 reported cases, including 8,454 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
The area around New York has become the epicenter for COVID-19 illness in the United States.
“We’re tracking the growth of the number of infections by hospital, and we can see just where the numbers are increasing. We’ve been talking about hitting the apex,” Cuomo said. “The apex is the point where the number of infections on a daily basis is at the high point that is the ultimate challenge I call it the battle of the mountaintop. That will be the Number One point of the engagement of the enemy.
“By the numbers we’re not at the apex. We’re getting closer, depending on whose model you’ll look at. They’ll say four, five, six seven days, some people go out 14 days but our reading of the projections is we’re somewhere in the seven-day range, four, five, six day range,” he added. “Nobody can give you a specific number, which makes it frustrating to plan when you don’t have a specific number or date, but we’re in that range. We’re not yet at the apex, but part of me says it’s good we’re not at the apex, because we’re not yet ready.”
The state’s been running short on needed medical equipment like ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gowns which medical professionals require.
Cuomo just signed an executive order designed to confiscate ventilators and PPE from hospitals where they are not used and deliver them to those where they are.

14,"With Firing Which Put ‘Politics Above Force Protection,’ Capt. Crozier Backed as Next Navy Sec’y",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/with-firing-which-put-politics-above-force-protection-capt-crozier-backed-as-next-navy-secy/,"The dismissal of an American Naval aircraft carrier captain for trying to get the word out about the spread of the novel coronavirus among his crew, reeks of the politics of pleasing Donald Trump, according to some analysts.
Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly fired Captain Brett Crozier, skipper of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, after Crozier sent out an email to 20 to 30 people, to warn them that dozens of his crew had already become sickened by COVID-19.
Crozier’s email was leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper, although there’s no evidence that Crozier himself was the leaker.
To many Americans, Captain Crozier is an American hero.
“Crozier’s crew cheered him as a hero as he walked alone down the gangway, leaving what will almost surely be his last command,” Washington Post columnist David Ignatius.
Democratic presidental candidate Joe Biden tweeted his support for Crozier.
Captain Crozier was faithful to his duty—both to his sailors and his country. Navy leadership sent a chilling message about speaking truth to power. The poor judgment here belongs to the Trump Admin, not a courageous officer trying to protect his sailors. pic.twitter.com/AkGFdlYjwt
— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) April 3, 2020
Crozier appears to have been fired only because he inadvertently politically embarrassed Donald Trump, since at the time of Crozier’s email Trump was trying to downplay the severity of the coronavirus pandemic.
As Ignatius reported in his column, “Modly told one colleague Wednesday, the day before he announced the move: ‘Breaking news: Trump wants him fired.'”
“I think the firing was a really bad decision, because it undermines the authority of the military commanders who are trying to take care of their troops, and significantly negatively impacts the willingness of commanders to speak truth to power,” retired Adm. Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Ignatius in an interview.
Max Boot, a well-known national security analyst who worked on the presidential campaigns of John McCain and Mitt Romney–but has been a fierce critic of Trump–also sees something foul in Crozier’s dismissal.
“I understand the need not to widely publicize problems that hurt the Navy’s operational readiness, but the context is troubling. About a month ago, when Trump was still calling concern about the coronavirus a ‘hoax,’ the New York Times reported that Esper had ‘urged American military commanders overseas not to make any decisions related to the coronavirus that might surprise the White House or run afoul of President Trump’s messaging on the growing health challenge,'” Boot wrote in his own Washington Post column on the topic. “This was a dismaying directive that seemed to put politics above force protection. Now Crozier’s firing will be seen, rightly or wrongly, as another step in the politicization of the military.”
Counter-terrorism expert and former Naval officer Malcolm Nance went even further in defending Captain Crozier.
“It is his main duty, all right, and in his letter, where he said we’re not in combat, they weren’t on a wartime cruise, that they did not need to risk the lives of the sailors beneath him in his command,” Nance said in an appearance on MSNBC. “Let me tell you something, 150 years ago, commanders of these vessels used to have to make decisions themselves about whether they had plague on the ship or whether they were going to ports that had other diseases.
“Now they expect to have this permission come down from the acting Secretary of the Navy–notice I said ‘acting,’ because there is no Secretary of the Navy because the last Secretary of the Navy resigned when Donald Trump overrode his orders which impacted the good order and discipline of our sailors. Now we have war criminals who are pardoned and put back into the Navy ranks but a good captain loses his job,” he said, referring to the case of former Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher. “This world is upside-down, and let me tell you, if I have anything to say about it, I think that Brett Crozier is a great candidate for the next Secretary of the Navy.”

15,Mike Pence Embraces Socialized Medicine,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/mike-pence-embraces-socialized-medicine/,"After years of he and his boss complaining about “socialism,” Vice President Mike Pence is promising healthcare to all Americans–whether they have health coverage or not.
“And I will make sure that any American knows — even those with no insurance–will be able to receive treatment in the hospital and never have to worry about the bill,” Pence said, going on to thank the American people for their help getting through the coronavirus outbreak.
But stop and reread Pence’s healthcare promise to the American people.
It sounds much more like something that you would expect to come out of the mouth of a Democrat than a top member of the Trump administration.
To be sure: Pence is extending his generous offer as part of a response to a pandemic (and don’t doubt that this national emergency comes in the same year that he and Donald Trump will face an already dicey re-election campaign has something to do with it).
Let’s set those ulterior motives aside and take Pence’s guarantee for the generous offer it represents.
Yes, certainly, we are in the midst of the worst pandemic in decades.
But what, intrinsically, makes being stricken with COVID-19 somehow more morally worthy of a government guarantee of treatment than say, a 60-year-old hotel housekeeper who suddenly finds herself with advanced breast cancer, but her job doesn’t afford her any coverage?
Or, for that matter, young parents whose new little one is diagnosed with spina bifida but neither one can afford coverage with their jobs?
The real answer is none of the above is somehow more ethically or morally worthy of government support than the other.
If the federal government can guarantee treatment of COVID-19, it certainly can guarantee treatment of other maladies, as well.
And, certainly, on costs: if the federal government can guarantee treatment now–in the midst of federal budgeting thrown out the window so that the government can throw literally trillions of dollars at the US economy in an attempt to save it–the government could craft a coverage program which pays for treatment for all Americans at a point when federal policymakers can sit down and work out a rational plan.
Perhaps Republicans will have to give up anymore of their tax giveaways for the rich, but Mike Pence has already shown that he can embrace coverage for all.

16,Cuomo: I Am Signing an Exec. Order to Seize Ventilators and PPE,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/cuomo-i-am-signing-an-exec-order-to-seize-ventilators-and-ppe/,"With equipment such as ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) becoming as valuable–and, often as scarce–in this new world as gold or oil, New York Gov Andrew Cuomo (D) signed an executive order designed to seize such gear and redirect it to where it’s needed most.
Governors such as Cuomo have often found themselves in competition with the federal government over the gear that saves lives in the COVID-19 pandemic while protecting the health and safety of health and medical providers.
There have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 58,000. 
In the United States, there have been 290,920 reported cases, including 7,844 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
The areas in and around New York have been the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, since that’s where the most cases are in the nation.
Under the terms of the executive order, the New York National Guard can confiscate gear like ventilators and PPE including medical masks and gowns from areas that aren’t using them and redeploy them to areas where they are needed most.
“We are still have the challenge of ventilators. We don’t have enough, period. The situation is very simple now. People come in, they are almost all COVID people. Ironically, the number of non-COVID cases has dropped because so many things are shut down that you don’t have the same number of automobile accidents or people getting hit by cars. You don’t have the same crime rates. So you don’t have the same number of trauma cases coming into a hospital,” Cuomo said. “They are COVID cases and many of them go right to the ICU, in the ICU you need a ventilator. If you don’t have a ventilator, the process stops. We don’t have enough ventilators. We’re doing everything possible, splitting of ventilators, using BiPAP machines, by this new protocol, using the anesthesia ventilators, we’re talking to the federal government to be as helpful as they can from the federal stockpile. But in truth I don’t believe the federal stockpile has enough to help all the states. Because you can’t buy the material at this point.
“We’re still trying to buy from China. We’re working with Alibaba which has been very, very helpful to us,” Cuomo added, referring to an international online marketplace. “I spoke to Jack Ma and Mike Evans, who is the president and they have been personally gracious and very, very helpful in trying to get us the source material from China. But we are going to have to redeploy ventilators from across the system. In other words, there are hospitals that have ventilators, there are hospitals that have PPE equipment. There are private sector companies that have PPE equipment that they are not using that we are going to need to redeploy to the places and the hospitals where we need them. I had a conversation with a hospital administrator yesterday. I understand they don’t want to give up their ventilators. Ventilators are expensive pieces of equipment. I understand that even if they are not using them, they are reluctant to see them go out the door.
“The theory is if the government gets them they will never get them back. I understand that. But I don’t have an option and I am not going to get into a situation where we know we are running out of ventilators and we could have people dying because there are no ventilators but there are hospitals in other parts of the state that have ventilators that they are not using,” Cuomo said. “I’m just not going to allow us to go there. I think it would be wholly irresponsible so I am going to sign an executive order that says the state can take ventilators and PPE from institutions that don’t need them now and redeploy them to other parts of the state and other hospitals that do need them.
“Those institutions will either get their ventilator back or they will be reimbursed and paid for their ventilator so they can buy a new ventilator. I can’t do anything more than that. But I am not going to be in a position where people are dying and we have several hundred ventilators in our own state somewhere else,” he added. “I apologize for the hardship to those institutions. Ultimately there is no hardship. If you don’t get the ventilator back, I give you my personal word I will pay you for the ventilator, but I am not going to let people die because we didn’t redistribute ventilators. The National Guard are going to be deployed to pick up these ventilators which are all across the state and deploy them to places where we need them.”

17,Fla. Congresswoman: Governor’s Delay of Stay at Home Order ‘Absolutely’ Did Cost Lives,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/fla-congresswoman-governors-delay-of-stay-at-home-order-absolutely-did-cost-lives/,"Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, issued a 30-day stay at home order this Wednesday, as part of a national effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, but by waiting this long into the pandemic to issue the order “absolutely” cost lives, according to Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla).
“It absolutely did. It’s tragic. I don’t know why people run for office if they’re not willing to make hard decisions,” said Shalala, who served as secretary of health and human services during the Clinton administration. “And our governor delayed and delayed until he waited for the president of the United States to pick up the phone and call him. This is about saving lives. And he has a responsibility in Florida to save lives and he diddled and daddled, and our mayors took stronger stands than he did, but he had a responsibility.
“And even when he put out the order, he left the gun shops open and he told people they could go to religious services. No one in south Florida believes that you should go to church,” Shalala added in an on-air TV interview. “In fact, our bishop of the Catholic Church has said, ‘We’ll do virtual church.’ So, again, he’s fine-tuned the decision in a way in which people are going to still be exposed. We need strong governors across the country.”
There have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 53,000.
In the United States, there have been 245,442 reported cases of COVID-19, with 6,099 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
The Sunshine State already has the fifth most confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States.
The state will have to prepare for an even greater surge, particularly given its large population of senior citizens, Shalala acknowledged.
“We’re going to have a tremendous spike in Florida, but not just seniors. People that have underlying conditions. As we test more people, as more people unfortunately and tragically die, we’re finding not just the senior population, but people that have underlying health conditions of all ages,” she said. “And our testing, by the way, is picking up people of all ages, not just seniors. But certainly, we need to target our resources at those that are the most vulnerable. And that’s what we’re trying to do to the extent we can get resources, but that’s where the governor needs to be strong.
“Apparently he has a special relationship with the president. He’s getting some resources, but we don’t have enough and we still have health care workers that are at risk,” Shalala added.

18,"Gov. Cuomo: The 17,000 Ventilators N.Y. Ordered from China Were Never Delivered",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/gov-cuomo-the-17000-ventilators-n-y-ordered-from-china-were-never-delivered/,"The Trump administration’s approach of treating the federal government and all 50 state governments as independent purchasers of medical equipment needed to combat the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has caused New York to lose 17,000 ventilators it needs to support the large number of COVID-19 cases in the state, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).
There have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 53,000.
In the United States, there have been 245,442 reported cases of COVID-19, with 6,099 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
The area in and around New York is presently the epicenter of the pandemic, with the largest number of cases in the United States.
“This state has purchased 17,000 ventilators, more than any other state in the nation, and they never got delivered because they’re all coming from China, and 50 states are competing. And I suspect that it’s been a bidding war and the highest order won,” Cuomo said in a television interview. “But we can’t get anymore ventilators. So we have a very elaborate plan on what to do if we run out of ventilators.
“We’re going to move to splitting ventilator where there’s a protocol one ventilator can handle two tubes, two patients. We’re going to use bipap machines and retrofit bipap machines and using the anesthesia machines,” Cuomo added. “And I’m going to redeploy the ventilators to the places that need them.”

19,Calls Grow For National Stay-at-home Order,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/calls-grow-for-national-stay-at-home-order/,"US political leaders, health professionals and others are all increasingly calling for a blanket national stay-at-home order to try to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Such a national order, from President Donald Trump, would supplant what has become a patchwork of state-by-state decisions, with most of the nation’s governors issuing such orders for their residents–but many other governors still resisting such orders, even as US reported cases of COVID-19 and deaths continue to mount daily.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is the latest state leader to relent and issue such an order.
There have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 53,000.
In the United States, there have been 245,442 reported cases of COVID-19, with 6,099 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
“The message is this. What are you waiting for? What more evidence do you need? If you think it’s not going to happen to you, there are many proof points all across this country, for that matter, around the rest of the world. Don’t dream of regretting. Lean into the moment, take responsibility and meet it head-on,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom (D). “You’ll never regret overcompensating at the moment so that you’re preparing people for meeting this moment in the responsible way. And there’s no greater intervention, period, full stop.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is also looking for a national order.
“I don’t know if you will call it rationale of some of the governors who have not implemented this. Not only is it harmful to their own people, but, again, it contributes to the spread of virus, which is harmful to everyone,” said the California Democrat. “We’re up to 90 percent of the American people sheltering in place or other stay-at-home initiatives. It should be 100 percent. This is a terrible, terrible assault on the lives and the livelihood of the American people, and we’re all in this together.”
CNN host Don Lemon also noted that Trump fails to heed social distancing protocols during the White House coronavirus briefings.
“Over 52,000 people have died and here in the United States we are still not doing what we need to do to fight this deadly virus because of a complete lack of leadership,” he said. “The president, who ignores social distancing night after night during his coronavirus briefings … still won’t issue a nationwide stay-at-home order.”
A national order is the only way to “flatten the curve,” so to speak, in terms of slowing the pandemic, according to former Microsoft chief Bill Gates, who became knowledgeable about infectious disease through the work of the charitable foundation of his and his wife, Melinda.
“Well, there isn’t a choice where you get to say to people don’t pay attention to this epidemic. You know, most people, they have older relatives, you know, they’re worried about getting sick. The idea of a normal economy is not there as a choice. You know, about 80 percent of people are going to change their activities. If you get the other 20 percent to go along with that nationwide, then the disease numbers will flatten, hopefully in the next month, and start to go down, hopefully in the month after that,” Gates said. “Then, when they’ve gone down a lot, then, in a tasteful way, using prioritized testing, you can start to reopen a lot of things, like schools and work. Probably not sports events because the chance of mass spread there is quite large.”
Even an infectious disease expert interviewed on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News program concurs with a national stay-at-home order.
“What we need to do now is make a concerted decision. I think it should be made at the national level as to what we are going to do. If we have a haphazard patch quilt of some states do one thing and other states do another, it is very difficult to know where we are going to go,” said Dr. Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University. “I think President Trump at this point, he clearly has a mandate to make whatever decisions he thinks are most in the public interest. My feeling is that if we actually do this on a national level, and invested the time, did it thoughtfully, then we would be out of this sooner rather than later?
“If we don’t do that we are going to have the same amount of pain, perhaps even more,” Dr Lipkin said. “I think we could get out of this in a matter of two months, if we focused. We are still not focused.

20,Florida Finally Issues a Stay At Home Order,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/coronavirus/florida-finally-issues-a-stay-at-home-order/,"Despite Florida having the fifth most confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, only issued a 30-day stay at home order this Wednesday, which will be going into effect today at midnight.
The move comes after a rapid growth of case numbers in the state and President Donald Trump declaring that the coronavirus guidelines will be extended for 30 days.
“I had decided on this, you know, when the president did the 30-day extension. To me, that was, people aren’t just going to go back to work. That’s a national pause button,” DeSantis said during a news conference in Tallahassee. “I think that given that we’re having a 30-day, I think that’s a signal from the president that, look, this is what we’re going to be fighting for a month.”
When the 30-day order is in place, Florida residents must stay isolated inside their homes and abstain from unnecessary movement and social interaction. DeSantis explained that residents will only be allowed to leave their house to “obtain or provide essential services or conduct essential activities.”

DeSantis previously resisted issuing a statewide order and said that it was up to cities and counties to decide lockdown measures for their residents. His lack of action was criticized heavily by public health experts and he particularly received backlash over not enforcing beach closures, with many beaches pictured crowded with spring breakers.
DeSantis argued that he would only implement a statewide order if he was directly recommended to do so by Trump or the federal government. He reiterated this argument at a news conference on Tuesday, telling reporters that he had been in contact with the White House coronavirus task force, and they did not tell him to carry out the order.
“The task force has not recommended (a statewide order) to me,” DeSantis remarked. “If they do, obviously that would be something that carries a lot of weight with me.”
“We are obviously taking whatever they say and we’re going to implement that in Florida. If any of those task force folks tell me that we should do X, Y or Z, of course we’re going to consider it. But nobody has said that to me thus far,” DeSantis added.
Prior to DeSantis’ announcement Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, claimed that to avoid Dr Anthony Fauci’s projected pandemic outcome of millions of cases and between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths, “populous states like Texas and Florida” would need to start acting “very aggressively.” Dr. Gottlieb explained that if these states did implement stricter measures, it would be possible to keep the total case number and death toll “well below those kind of models.”

Now with DeSantis changing his mind, state agriculture commissioner Nikki Fried, who earlier blasted DeSantis for not carrying out the order, has since thanked him for “making the right call.”
“When I called for this stay at home order nearly two weeks ago, there was a reason. It was necessary to flatten the curve and save lives,” Fried commented. “I said then I would stand with the Governor when he issued the order, and I do so now…. Together, we will fight this virus and preserve the state we love.”
Others, however, have said that the order has come too late and it may have cost lives.
“DeSantis ignored the obvious for too long, and Floridians likely are sicker for it,” the Miami Herald editorial board said. “His statewide essential-services-only order, though welcome, is so very late.”
Besides Florida, Mississippi and Georgia have also declared stay at home orders.
According to data by The COVID-19 Tracking Project, Mississippi currently has the highest coronavirus hospitalization rate in the United States, at around 31 percent.
Mississippi Hospital Association President Timothy Moore warned that the hospital system may soon be pushed to its limit.
“As the pandemic worsens, the need for ICU beds, critical care beds, ventilators…which in turn requires a higher level of trained expertise to take care of those patients, that’s going to be the biggest challenge that we face,” Moore noted. “If you look at even a 20 percent exposure rate, you’re looking at regular normal hospital beds, we would be in need of about 20 percent more beds than we have.”

21,Stacey Abrams: I Would Be Happy To Be Joe Biden’s Running Mate,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/stacey-abrams-i-would-be-happy-to-be-joe-bidens-running-mate/,"Although the presidential race has been in something like suspended animation these past few weeks as the nation and the world grapples with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams snapped it back to life–if only briefly–by publicly announcing that she would be pleased to be Joe Biden’s running mate.
During last month’s Democratic presidential debate against his sole remaining rival, Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt), Biden promised to name a woman as his vice presidential running mate.
In an interview with MSNBC, Abrams–who very nearly became governor of Georgia in the 2018 election–said she would accept if Biden offered her a spot on the 2020 Democratic ticket.
“I have not been in conversation with Vice President Biden, but I’m very honored to be considered. I believe I bring the experience in the public sector, the private sector, the non-profit sector. I’ve also done international work and I’ve been an effective leader. Just this year and last year I stood up a 20-state network to ensure protection of our elections,” she said, referring to the sort of voter suppression that she says cost her the margin of victory in her gubinatorial election.
“But more than anything, I’m committed to helping serve this country with the common sense, with the leadership and with the experience to work at the state and national level,” Abrams said. “Because we have to remember, part of the response we’re seeing right now in lieu of leadership from the national level has been our states, and it’s been my privilege for 11 years to help lead the state of Georgia as Democratic leader for seven years and state legislator for 11 years.”
Further, Abrams put herself on the same page as Biden in advocating for this year’s elections go ahead and be conducted via postal mail in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
“Vote by mail is the safest way to vote. And right now almost I would say every state has the capacity to vote by mail,” Abrams said in her MSNBC interview. “The challenge is that in a lot of states you have to have an excuse. In fact, Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama today or yesterday said that she wasn’t in favor of removing the excuse. The reality is everyone has an excuse, COVID-19. We need to be certain that even if things have tampered down by then, we have to prepare for it not to be so. And that means we have to start planning now for November election. We need vote by mail, it needs to be postage paid.
“There needs to be safeguards to ensure that people do not have to provide unnecessary information and we have to make certain that for those who need to vote in person, that they still have the opportunity,” she said. “The disabled community, people with language barriers, people without addresses, they need to be able to go into a polling place and cast their ballots in accordance with [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines. But vote by mail should be available to every eligible American, and we have limited in-person early voting.”

22,"Lack of Trust in Trump Plays Into His Modest Bump, Fmr. Senator Says",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/lack-of-trust-in-trump-plays-into-his-modest-bump-fmr-senator-says/,"The fact that Donald Trump has proven untrustworthy and unreliable at the head of the daily White House coronavirus briefings has resulted in only a very modest bump at best in public opinion polling during this crisis, according to a former US senator.
Since the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic began, Trump first began trying to downplay the importance of the illness. He also has been known to spout off falsehoods and inaccuracies. For instance, he has said with some certainty that the virus would pass in a “month,” contradicting expert advice from the CDC which says that the virus could be affecting some places into the summer.
In another instance, Trump falsely stated that no one could have predicted a need for so many ventilators. The truth is that experts have been warning of ventilator shortages for some time.
Historically, Americans tend to rally around the president in times of crisis, and that effect will be registered in the president’s public opinion polling.
There have been more than 950,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 48,000. 
In the United States, there have been 213,144 cases reported, including 4,513 deaths, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Although Trump has seen a bump in his polling, it’s been extremely modest in comparison to those seen by his predecessors in times of national crisis.
“Well, I think every time there’s a crisis in our country, the American people want to support the president. I mean, you could an look at your old boss,” former Democratic senator Clare McCaskill told MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, who served in the White House with George W Bush in a recent segment. “I think his approval ratings got up to 82 percent at one point. You would probably remember. Maybe even higher after 9/11. So there is always, I believe, going to be some kind of bump.
“The fact that [Trump’s] bump is modest speaks to the fact that most Americans know that about half the time at least he’s not telling the truth, that he has not told the truth about this crisis in many important ways, and I think that it is really just a function of everyone wanting the president to do better and wanting to be supportive,” McCaskill added.
“… So there is a time when people set aside their partisanship and want to support everyone in this country,” she said. “Unfortunately, the president is not really rising to the occasion. He may have had a bump but he’s not enjoying the kind of approval that traditionally presidents would have when responding to any kind of crisis.”

23,On Trump Extending the Social Distancing Guidelines: Advisers Told Him ‘You Will Own These Deaths’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/on-trump-extending-the-social-distancing-guidelines-advisers-told-him-you-will-own-these-deaths/,"Donald Trump’s backpedaling on his desire to reopen the country in time for Easter came after campaign advisers for his re-election campaign told him that the public would hold him primarily responsible for the resulting increase in American deaths, according to a Washington Post reporter.
Trump, for about a week, fixated on ending the extreme lockdowns and social distancing which have been in place as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak, despite public health professionals estimates that that would not be wise from a health perspective.
Trump’s motivation was primarily one to restart the increasingly foundering US economy.
However, Trump changed his mind as his political advisers changed theirs, including that of his son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner, MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell mentioned on her program, in an interview with Washington Post reporter Ashley Parker. Ultimately, Trump recommended that the social distancing be continued through April.
“That’s exactly right. And I don’t want to say it was only political considerations because it wasn’t. It was him listening to the scientists, having a very good and warm chemistry with especially Dr. [Deborah] Birx,” Parker said, referring to the White House coronavirus response coordinator. “It was as he said publicly seeing those images out of Elmhurst Hospital in Queens in the shadow where he grew up. But there was a political undercurrent as well.
“The president, as we understand, was told by campaign advisers and allies basically that he would pay more of a political price,” Parker added. “Of course, it’s a virus spiraled further out of control and there were more deaths than he would for an economic shutdown. There’s a belief that was communicated to him that as of now, he doesn’t own any of the downside of the economy.
“It’s a global pandemic, and he will own all of the upside if and when the economy rebounds, but a number of allies and advisers told him, ‘You will own these deaths. You will owe what happens with the coronavirus,’ and that and the models and numbers he was shown, these very grim forecasts, helped get him to abruptly the turnaround we saw in the Rose Garden Sunday and extend the social distancing guidance for 30 days until the end of April,” Parker said.

24,"Pelosi Calls on Trump to Use Defense Production Act, but Trump Already Has",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/pelosi-calls-on-trump-to-use-defense-production-act-but-trump-already-has/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for President Donald Trump to “immediately” use the full powers of the Defense Production Act (DPA) to prevent shortages of life-saving medical supplies and personal protection equipment amid the pandemic.
“It’s the governors, the mayors, people across the country who are saying, ‘We need the equipment, the personal protective equipment for the workers, the ventilators and other equipment for the patients’… So, I would say to the president, immediately implement the Defense Production Act insisting that businesses in our country turn to producing the equipment that we need,” Pelosi said Tuesday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe.
“We’re asking people to risk their lives to save other lives. We’re asking people to make judgments about who gets a ventilator or not. That should not be happening,” she added. 

Her comments come after health care workers across multiple states have spoken up about not having enough personal protection equipment and vital supplies like ventilators. They have expressed concerns that if more equipment and supplies are not provided soon, they will be unable to support the increasing number of COVID-19 patients.
“We have to have gowns, masks, and face shields. All those are in limited supply,” remarked Allan Kamara, an emergency room nurse in San Jose. “We are being put in a position where we have to do a job that we really want to do, but we don’t have the supplies to do that job right.”
Despite Pelosi’s claim that Trump is not utilizing the DPA, last Friday, Trump invoked the act to order General Motors to manufacture ventilators and prioritize their production.
“Our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,” Trump noted in a statement. “GM was wasting time. Today’s action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives.”
Two days later, Trump praised General Motors, saying that they seem to be “doing a fantastic job,” and “I don’t think we have to worry about General Motors now.”
Co-host Mika Brzezinski, referring to Trump using the act for General Motors, asked Pelosi if she was therefore suggesting that there is more “he could be doing to actually trigger it?”
“Yes, so he has discreetly done something about ventilators but there is an overall appeal for him to do much, much more, and this is nothing that can be handled piecemeal. It has to be across the board, this isn’t partisan in any way,” Pelosi explained. “American people are concerned about…the personal protection equipment for our workers, the equipment to save the lives of our patients, and that act can help with that.”
Pelosi shared a similar response in a statement released the same day Trump invoked the act:
“The news that the President will finally begin to use the Defense Production Act to mass produce ventilators is an important but seriously belated step. Much more must be done. The president must use the full powers of this law to address the dire, widespread shortage of materials required to fight this pandemic, including diagnostic test supplies, masks and other personal protective equipment.”
During the interview, Pelosi also emphasized the need for more widespread and effective testing measures.
“Proper testing, that’s been a problem since the start,” Pelosi stated. “We haven’t had the proper testing.”
Her view on testing stands in stark contrast to Trump’s, who recently said on a conference call with governors that he had not “heard about testing being a problem.”
Trump has since addressed Pelosi’s remarks on Morning Joe, tweeting:

“Watched a portion of low rated (very) Morning Psycho (Joe) this Morning in order to see what Nancy Pelosi had to say, & what moves she was planning to further hurt our Country. Actually, other than her usual complaining that I’m a terrible person, she wasn’t bad. Still praying!”
The United States now has nearly 200,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and the death toll has exceeded 3,400.

25,Gov. Cuomo: The Number of Coronavirus Deaths Is ‘Already Staggering’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/gov-cuomo-the-number-of-coronavirus-deaths-is-already-staggering/,"While Donald Trump contemplates ultimate US fatalities in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, the loss of life from the virus in New York is “already staggering,” according to Gov Andrew Cuomo (D).
There have been more than 800,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 39,000.
In the United States, there have been 175,669 reported cases of the illness, and 3,424 deaths, according to the most recent figures. The US death toll from the pandemic has reached the grim milestone that more Americans now have perished from the virus than in the entire September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Trump this week revealed that he believes that as many as 100,000 to 200,000 American lives could be lost due to the pandemic, but even still he would be doing a good job as president.
“The White House estimates 100,000 to 200,000 as a death toll. We don’t have projections in this state as to numbers of deaths. We’re studying models, which, by the way, are done by very professional companies. I don’t come up with these numbers. We have Cornell Weill working on it, McKinsey working on it, the Bill Gates Foundation has an institute that does projections. We’re studying the projections to see how we best deploy to make sure we’re ready for the next battle, make sure we’re ready for the apex. Is it 100,000? Is it 200,000? Look, whatever the number is, it’s going to be staggering. The number is already staggering,” Cuomo said. “Human life is a human life. We have lost over 1,000 New Yorkers. To me we are beyond staggering already. We have reached staggering. And the only — only point now is do everything you can to save every life possible. That’s what this is all about.”
The epicenter of the outbreak has been centered on New York, which has left hospitals and medical assistance in the state at a breaking point, and needing relief, Cuomo added.
“We need relief. We need relief for nurses who are working 12-hour shifts, one after the other after the other. We need relief for doctors. We need relief for attendants. So if you’re not busy, come help us, please,” the governor beseeched. “And we will return the favor. We will return the favor. New York, yes, we have it now intensely, there will be a curve. New York at one point will be on the other side of the curve, and then there will be an intense issue somewhere else in the nation.
“And the New York way is to be helpful. So help New York, we are the ones hit now. That’s today, but tomorrow it will be somewhere else, whether it’s Detroit, whether it’s New Orleans, it will work its way across the country,” Cuomo said. “This is the time for us to help one another. We need supplies desperately, and we’re working on that.”

26,TV Commentators Urge Networks To Cease Broadcasting Full Trump Coronavirus Briefings,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/tv-commentators-urge-networks-to-cease-broadcasting-full-trump-coronavirus-briefings/,"TV commentators on competing networks are urging television executives to decide to stop broadcasting Donald Trump’s full coronavirus briefings to the nation, because Trump is not necessarily truthful and he often treats them more like a form of entertainment.
“I’m not actually sure, if you want to be honest, that we should carry that live. I think we should run snippets. I think we should do it afterwards and get the pertinent points to the American people. He’s never, ever going to tell you the truth,” said CNN host Don Lemon.
Trump’s statements have been found to be often containing falsehoods and inaccuracies during his coronavirus briefings.
“Guess what he’s going to do? If you ask a question that is a legitimate question, and if he doesn’t like the question he’s going to say–whether you’re being mean or not, or whatever he wants to call it–he is going to say that is a mean, nasty question,” Lemon added. “Why? Because he wants his base to think the media’s being mean to him and they’re attacking him. It is all a plot. It is all orchestrated, and if you can’t see it, I don’t know what you’re looking at.
“So, you know, it’s obvious, it’s transparent to me. Those press briefings have become his new Apprentice,” Lemon said, referring to Trump’s former television reality series. “They’ve become his new rallies, and he treats the press and the media as if he’s talking to the people in his rallies. It’s the same thing. It’s no different. It’s just that the audience is not there.”
Meanwhile, over on competing network MSNBC, host Chris Hayes came to much the same conclusion during an interview with Sen Chris Murphy (D-Conn).
“Media go along with it because his press conference is, as always, are still entertaining in part because he is combative and in part because he does lie and you can catch him in the lies and hold him accountable but that doesn’t make for an effective public health response,” Murphy said.
“Yeah, that’s why he’s bragging about the ratings” of his briefings, Hayes replied. “Obviously above my pay grade. I don’t make the call.
“Take it or not but it seems crazy to me everyone is taking them when you have the My Pillow guy getting up there talking about reading the Bible,” Hayes said, referring to a White House event which featured My Pillow CEO, and fervent Trump supporter, Mike Lindell.

27,"Dr. Fauci: We Have a Serious Problem in NY, New Orleans, And More Yet to Come",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/coronavirus/dr-fauci-we-have-a-serious-problem-on-ny-new-orleans-and-more-yet-to-come/,"The United States now has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world, with more than 120,000. The death toll has also doubled in two days, reaching 2,000 Saturday evening.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, appeared on CNN’s State of the Union Sunday morning and emphasized the “very difficult problem” the United States is now facing.
“We have areas of the country such as the New York area. We’ll be seeing places like Detroit and other cities start to get into trouble, where the curve did what exactly I said on this show and other shows some time ago, it putters along a while and then it goes way up. When it does that, you’re really in full mitigation, it’s very difficult to do containment,” Dr. Fauci said.
Previously, Dr. Fauci has stressed the importance of flattening the curve – to slow the speed of infection rate so cases are staggered over a longer period instead of a sudden surge. Doing so would mean that case numbers are always at a manageable level, which is particularly important for hospitals.

Dr. Fauci then went on to call for stronger mitigation efforts in hot zone areas such as New York, and not to neglect “other areas of the country where it looks like there are just relatively few infections, because we have a window of opportunity there…to get out there and test areas.”
“If we do testing, identification, isolation, getting people out of circulation who are infected, and contact tracing, we might be able to prevent those areas from getting to that stage where we would have to do mitigation, which is much more difficult and much more frustrating than trying to contain,” Dr. Fauci explained.
State of the Union host Jake Tapper also asked Dr. Fauci how many COVID-19 cases did he think “the U.S. will reach?”
“You know, Jake, to be honest with you, we don’t have any firm idea,” Dr. Fauci remarked. “There are things called models. When someone creates a model, they put in various assumptions. And the model is only as good or as accurate as your assumptions. Whenever the models come in, they give a worst case scenario and a best case scenario. Generally the reality is somewhere in the middle. I’ve never seen a model of the diseases that I’ve dealt with where the worst case scenario actually came out.”
He then offered his prediction, estimating around “millions of cases” and between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths. However, he made it clear it was only a prediction and he did not “want to be held to that,” noting “when it’s such a moving target…you can so easily be wrong and mislead people.”
“What we do know, Jake, is that we’ve got a serious problem in New York. We have a serious problem in New Orleans. And we’re going to be developing serious problems in other areas. So people like to model it. Let’s just look at the data of what we have and not worry about these worst case and best case scenarios.”
On Saturday, White House coronavirus task force member, Dr. Deborah Birx, declared that “No state, no metro area will be spared” from the pandemic.

Similar to Dr. Fauci, she asserted that all states and metro areas need to be taking measures to help delay and prevent the virus’s spread.
“The sooner we react, and the sooner the states and the metro areas react and ensure that they put in full mitigation, at the same time understanding exactly what their hospitals need, then we’ll be able to move forward together and protect the most Americans,” Dr. Birx said on NBC’s Meet the Press.

28,"House Chairwoman Waters Outlines Need for Another Coronavirus Stimulus: Help for Renters, More Help for Small Business",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/house-chairwoman-waters-outlines-need-for-another-coronavirus-stimulus-help-for-renters-more-help-for-small-business/,"The chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee said that she sees a need for an additional stimulus package to help with the economic fallout from the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic.
This would be on top of the massive $2 trillion economic rescue package Congress just approved.
The US economy has already begun to reel from the effects of the pandemic, including a sudden spike in those Americans seeking unemployment compensation as the nation’s unemployment rate spiked upward, with 3.3 million Americans reporting job loss, exceeding expert forecasts and breaking records going back to 1982.
In the United States, there have been 125,308 reported cases of the disease, and 2,246 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif), chairwoman of the financial business panel, cited a need to do more to help those at the lowest income levels get by in these uncertain times.
“We have people who work every day who have minimum wages. When they get laid off, when they get fired they don’t have any cushion. They have nowhere to turn, and they need to not only put food on the table. They need to put gasoline in the car. They have debt. And so what I did in my plan was I made sure that, Number One, we took care of all renters,” Waters said. “This plan only takes care of renters that are government assisted. But we have people who are living in units that are owned by landlords, may be units of six, 12, 18 units and these landlords have mortgages to pay and they need to be paid. We don’t want them to evict anybody, but we need to create a facility in which we pay landlords who do not evict. That has to be in the next plan. We make sure we cover those that need that rent assistance.
“In addition to that, I have in my plan that the credit bureaus cannot basically diminish your credit ratings. And so that’s not in this plan. Also I have in my plan basically paying the bills, credit cards, other kinds of things that low income people have debt that needs to be paid. So we’re going to be looking at all of that,” Waters added. “We’re going to be looking more at our small businesses. I think this plan is very good for small businesses, but we’ve got to do more. We have people who provide the catering service for them. I have a woman who called me and she’s pretty desperate. I’m going to do everything I can to look out for these small businesses. We still have people who are in their homes hungry. We have one woman who called, couldn’t take her medicine because she had no food in her home, and so we just took her some food and said here’s some food, we’re going to get more food to you tomorrow, but today here’s enough food for you for a couple of days. Take your medicine, don’t be sick. And so everybody’s working. I’m going to put into the next bill much of what was not covered in this bill.
“And I know that the president has gotten away with a lot of lying about what is going to happen with the defense act, and he said that he was going to, first of all, invoke it,” Waters said, referring to a Korean War-era law which gives the president authority to press industry into manufacturing needed items. “He did not. He waited until the heat was on him, and then he lied on some of the big businesses that he had he had an agreement with, that he really didn’t have.”

29,Klobuchar to Trump: ‘Lead Instead of Blaming the Governors’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/klobuchar-to-trump-lead-instead-of-blaming-the-governors/,"A Democratic senator and former presidential candidate castigated Donald Trump for too often blaming the nation’s governors who are trying to manage through the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic.
In the United States, there have been 105,778 confirmed cases and 1,731 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
Donald Trump has come under fire in recent days for a combative and accusatory attitude with some of the nation’s governors who are trying to deal with the virus outbreak.
These Democratic governors in Trump’s firing line include Jay Inslee of Washington State and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.
“I want the president to lead and not spend a quarter of his press conferences blaming other people and going after governors. I want the president, of course, I wish that he had planned ahead when this started happening in China in terms of getting those tests in massive amounts ready to go and letting places like Mayo Clinic, which is now working on a serum test, getting those approved right away,” Klobuchar said. “I think that’s what we should be doing now. And as for the equipment for people in the hospitals, he just has to do everything he can to lead and not say that he’s just the backup.
“This is a national pandemic. This is a global pandemic. This is a time when leaders lead instead of blaming the governors who are basically on the front line trying to do their best every single day,” added Klobuchar, whose own husband is infected and fighting the disease.

30,UK PM ANNOUNCES HE’S TESTED POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/uk-pm-announces-hes-tested-positive-for-coronavirus/,"Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the United Kingdom who has become known for his boisterous efforts to finish the process known as “Brexit,” has announced that he has tested positive for the novel coronavirus and “mild symptoms” of the COVID-19 illness.
In the UK, there are more than 17,000 confirmed cases and at least 1,019 people have died, according to the BBC.
“Hi, folks I want to bring you up to speed with something that’s happening today, which is I have developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. That’s to say a temperature and a persistent cough. On the advice of the chief medical officer, I’ve taken a test. That has come out positive. So I am working from home, I’m self-isolating, and that’s entirely the right thing to do,” said Johnson, who took over at No. 10 Downing Street last year, promising swift action on Britain’s acrimonious divorce from the European Union, known as “Brexit.”
“But be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus,” added Johnson, 55, who has sometimes been compared in style to Donald Trump. “I want to thank everyone who is involved. I want to thank, of course, above all, our amazing [National Health Service] NHS staff. It was very moving last night to join in that national clap for the NHS.
“But it’s not just the NHS, it’s our police and social care workers and teachers, everybody who works in schools and [Department for Work and Pensions] DWP staff. It’s an amazing national effort by the public services, but also by every member of the British public who’s volunteering, incredible response, 600,000 people have volunteered to take part in a great national effort to protect people from the consequences of coronavirus,” Johnson said. “I want to thank you, I want to thank everybody who is working to keep our country going through this epidemic. We will get through it, and the way we will get through it is, of course, by applying the measures you’ve heard so much about.
“And the more effectively we all comply with those measures, the faster our country will come through this epidemic and the faster we will all bounce back,” he added. “So thank you to everybody who is doing what I’m doing, working from home to stop the spread of the virus from household to household. That’s the way we’ll win. We are going to beat it and we’ll beat it together. Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”

31,US Diplomat Haass: ‘China Cannot Be Held Responsible for Our Lack of Testing’ or Shortage of Ventilators,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/richard-haass-china-cannot-be-held-responsible-for-our-lack-of-testing-or-shortage-of-ventilators/,"If Donald Trump wants to blame China for the outbreak of the coronavirus and the COVID-19 pandemic, that blame can go only so far, particularly while Donald Trump maintains a “schizophrenic relationship” with China, according to a prominent American diplomat.
Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former State Department official and adviser to one-time secretary of state Colin Powell, was asked about Donald Trump’s attempts to blame China for the virus outbreak, which is blamed for more than 610,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 28,000.
In the United States, there have been 105,778 confirmed cases and 1,731 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
“Look, China does deserve criticism, not so much because it began there–it could have begun anywhere–but because of the cover-up and their initial response,” Haass said in an on-air segment on CNN. “But China cannot be held responsible for our lack of testing or our shortage of ventilators or anything else. We’ve got to deal with that ourselves. This also, though, takes place in a larger context.
“This administration has had a bizarre, almost schizophrenic relationship approach to China since the get-go. On one hand we’ve painted them as a strategic rival. We’ve been incredibly critical. On the other hand, as as recently as today, the president has this friendly conversation with [China’s] President Xi. We did the first phase of a trade deal. It’s both ways. They want to blame China, and at the same time they want to maintain something of a relationship with China, and certainly with its leader.”

32,Gov. Cuomo Slams ‘Irresponsible’ and ‘Reckless’ Coronavirus Bill: ‘It Does Absolutely Nothing for Us in Terms of Lost Revenue’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/gov-cuomo-slams-irresponsible-and-reckless-coronavirus-bill-it-does-absolutely-nothing-for-us-in-terms-of-lost-revenue/,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) slammed the enormous $2 trillion economic stimulus package hashed out by Congress to stabilize the US economy from the impact of the battering from the effects of the novel coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic, as inadequate.
Cuomo, who has become a national leader as the virus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic has continued on, said that the stimulus package doesn’t address his state’s lost revenue, which he estimated at between $10 billion to $15 billion.
In the United States, there have been 93,151 reported cases, including 1,382 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
New York is the site of the most reported cases in the nation, where at least some hospitals are already at a breaking point.
“The congressional action, in my opinion, simply failed to address the governmental need. I spoke to all the officials involved, I spoke to our House delegation, I spoke to our senators, and I believe what they did failed to meet the governmental need. I’m disappointed. I said I was disappointed. I find it irresponsible. I find it reckless,” the governor said. “Emotion is a luxury and we don’t have the luxury at this time of being emotional about what they did. When this is over, I promise you I’m going to give them a piece of my mind. But I would say to them today, this is an extraordinary time in this nation and it’s an extraordinary time for government. This was the time to put politics aside and partisanship aside. This is the time for governmental leaders to stop making excuses and just do your job. Do your job.
“We’re one nation. You know the places in this nation that have the most intense problems. Address the places that need the help. This is not a time to point fingers. This is not a time to make excuses. This is not a time to blame everyone else. We’ve lived with that in Washington for years. Now is a time to actually step up, do the right thing and do your job. And they haven’t as far as I’m concerned, especially when it comes to the governmental need,” Cuomo added. “In any event, we have to do a budget and the budget is due April 1. So the only responsible course for us is, number one, we have to address this revenue loss.”

33,Cuomo Says Some People Could Start Going Back to Work with a Modified Public Health Strategy,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/cuomo-says-some-people-could-start-going-back-to-work-with-a-modified-public-health-strategy/,"It seems as though Donald Trump’s message to reopen the country for Easter may be getting through, after all.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced Thursday that perhaps younger people and those who have already recovered from COVID-19 may be encouraged to get back to work as part of a “modified public health strategy.”
Trump this week has been repeatedly encouraging the country to throw off the restrictive social distancing and quantining measures its been under, in the name of restarting the nation’s battered economy.
A number of public health professionals have called Trump’s Easter deadline premature from a perspective of the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic.
There have been more than 550,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 25,000.
In the United States, there have been 93,151 reported cases, including 1,382 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
Trump has faced harsh criticism for his Easter deadline. Cuomo didn’t mention Easter specifically, but his state has been the site of the largest number of cases in the nation, so his announcement now is significant.
“It’s something the nation is working on, something that we’re working through. And I think the smartest way forward is a modified public health strategy that dovetails and complements a get-back-to-work strategy,” Cuomo said in his press conference. “What we did was we closed everything down. That was our public health strategy. Just close everything. All businesses, all workers, young people, old people, short people, tall people, every school, close everything.
“If you rethought that or had time to analyze that public health strategy, I don’t know that you would say quarantine everyone. I don’t even know that was the best public health policy,” Cuomo added. “Young people then quarantined with older people was probably not the best public health strategy. Because the younger people could have been exposing the older people to an infection.
“So how do you modify the public health strategy to make it smarter from a public health point of view, but also starts to get you back to work? Younger people can go back to work. People who have resolved can go back to work. People who — once we get this antibody test, show that they had the virus and they resolved can go back to work. That’s how I think you do it. It’s not we’re going to either do public health or we’re going to do economic development restarting. We have to do both. We have to do both. We’re working on it. And I think that’s the same thing the federal government is working through,” he said.

34,NYC Doctor Warns His Hospital Is Already at Breaking Point on Coronavirus,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/nyc-doctor-warns-his-hospital-is-already-at-breaking-point-on-coronavirus/,"Medical response capabilities in New York City are stretched seriously thin, and medical professionals are rationing supplies, according to one hospital emergency medicine chief.
There have been more than 480,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 22,000. 
In the United States, 68,802 have been reported sickened, with 1,037 reported deaths, according to the most recent figures.
New York state is where the largest number of cases in the nation has been.
“You know, I’m not here to talk politics. I’m here to talk about patients and the reality is what we’re seeing right now in our emergency rooms is dire,” Dr Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, said in a CNN interview. “Last week when I went to work we talked about the one or two patients amongst the dozens of others that might have been a covid or coronavirus patient. This week in my shift nearly every single patient I took care of was coronavirus and many of them extremely severe. Many were put on breathing tubes. Many decompensated quickly.
“Our first New York City case was on March 1. That’s just over three weeks ago. To think that will be in anyplace to lift these restrictionary measures by Easter in two or three weeks, for me seems completely magical thinking,” Dr Spencer added, referring to Donald Trump’s stated desire to end the restrictive social distancing by Easter. “What we know is that this math and modelling map can tell us is the number of cases going to continue to rise. We’re really at the beginning of this outbreak. You can feel that. You can sense it. It’s palpable on the front lines in the emergency department.”
Supplies in the New York hospitals are extremely tight, Dr Spencer said.
“Yeah, the supply chain is extremely tight. One thing I tell people when I worked in west Africa for ebola, the one thing I never worried about was having enough ppe, personal protective equipment,” he said. “It’s something my colleagues all over New York City are worried about now. The number of masks people are given, we’re given — some people are given one n-95 respirator mask, the thicker one that helps prevent the virus from being inhaled by a provider. Given one of those a week. And the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] doesn’t want you using those. People are given one surgical mask a shift.
“And everyone is doing everything they can to conserve supplies because we know we’re just at the beginning of this,” Dr Spencer said. “And after New York will be New Jersey, will be New Mexico. This is going to be a marathon. We are not even at the beginning.”

35,Lawmakers Split Over Whether US Workers Deserve Support in Economic Stimulus,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/lawmakers-split-over-whether-us-workers-deserve-support-in-economic-stimulus/,"Two leading senators, each a top name on his side of the political aisle, differ sharply over whether US workers have a right to the level of support coming to them in the massive, $2 trillion economic stimulus package nearing final approval in Congress to blunt the economic fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic.
In the United States, 68,802 have been reported sickened, with 1,037 reported deaths, according to the most recent figures.
The Senate approved the enormous rescue package as the US economy begins a freefall caused by the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. The House is expected to approve the legislation and send it to Donald Trump for his signature into law.
Even as the legislation was making its way through Congress, the nation’s unemployment rate spiked upward last week, with 3.3 million Americans reporting job loss, exceeding expert forecasts and breaking records going back to 1982.
Sen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a prominent Republican, complained in an interview on Fox News about the benefits that struggling American workers can collect from the stimulus package.
“In my wildest dreams I would never believe we would pass a bill that would give you a pay raise if you got unemployed. I want people to get their income while they are unemployed but I don’t want to increase their wages because you incentivize people to leave their job,” Graham said. “In this bill, you will have 50-percent to 150-percent pay raises to people if they leave the workforce. Good luck with Amazon hiring 100,000 people because unemployed benefits in South Carolina equal $23 an hour. I’m really going to hire people in South Carolina when you’re competing with government wages at $23 an hour?”
Meanwhile, in a speech delivered on the Senate floor, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) who has also been running for the Democratic nomination for president, took Republican naysayers like Graham to task for miserly rhetoric toward struggling American workers.
“What this bill does is it says, rightly so, that in the midst of this terrible economic crisis where some people, nobody knows
— where some economists are estimating by June, unemployment could be 20 percent, 30 percent. What this bill does say is: whether or not you are eligible for unemployment today, you’re going to get employment compensation. And that means many of the gig workers–people that drive Uber cars, many of the waitresses and waiters making starvation-minimum wages, many so-called independent contractors–they will be eligible for the extended unemployment benefit. That is exactly the right thing,” Sanders said. “And the other thing that this bill does which is right is it says, ‘Okay, we are in the midst of a horrific crisis–unprecedented in modern American history–not only are you going to get your regular unemployment benefit, we’re going to add another $600 a week to it.’
“And now I find that some of my Republican colleagues are very distressed. They’re very upset that somebody who is making 10, 12 bucks an hour might end up with a paycheck for four months more than they received last week. Oh, my God, the universe is collapsing,” Sanders added, sarcastically. “Imagine that. Somebody is making 12 bucks an hour, now like the rest of us faces an unprecedented economic crisis with the 600 bucks on top of their normal unemployment check might be making a few bucks more for four months. Oh, my word. Will the universe survive?
“How absurd and wrong is that? What kind of value system is that? Meanwhile, these very same folks had no problem a couple of years ago voting for a trillion dollars in tax breaks for billionaires and large profitable corporations. Not a problem,” Sanders said. “But when it comes to low-income workers in the midst of a terrible crisis, maybe some of them earning or having more money than they previously made, oh, my word, we’ve got to strip that out.
“By the way, when the [Sen. Mitch] McConnell bill first came up unbelievably and I know many Republicans objected to this, they were saying that well, we want to give — whatever it was — a thousand or 1,200 bucks but poor people should get less because poor people are down here,” he added. “They don’t deserve — they don’t eat. They don’t pay rent. They don’t go to the doctor. They’re somehow inferior because they’re poor, going to give them less. That was addressed. Now everybody is going to get the $1,200. But some of my Republican friends still haven’t given up on the need to punish the poor and working people. You haven’t raised the minimum wage in 10 years. Minimum wage should be at least 15 bucks an hour. You haven’t done that. You’ve cut program after program after program and now, horror of horrors, for four months workers might be earning a few bucks more than they otherwise were.”

36,Senators See Potential Need for Further Economic Stimulus After $2T Package,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/senators-see-potential-need-for-further-economic-stimulus-after-2t-package/,"The Senate approved an enormous $2 trillion economic stimulus package aimed at shoring up a US economy being battered by the impact of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic, but at least two senators see the potential for a need for Congress to pass additional stimulus bills.
The massive Senate bill–which will provide direct checks to millions of Americans, aid to small businesses as well as larger industries–will go to the House which is set to approve the huge legislation.
Democratic Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Kirsten Gillibrand both said that they see the potential for Congress for come back and add to the stimulus already being approved.
“This bill is very helpful, but it’s just the first step,” Gillibrand said in an interview with CNN. “This is going to be a very long-term crisis. It’s going to take months and months to get out of it.”
Meanwhile, Blumenthal indicated that not just one, but perhaps even two, more stimulus bills might be required.
“You know, we’re not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We know that there is an urgency here, we’re going to get this package done. The point is to get it done quickly but get it done right. Still, it won’t be perfect, and my view is there may well be a need for a fourth package, maybe even a fifth package,” Blumenthal said. “We ought to be prepared to vote if necessary, maybe remotely. I’m prepared to come back to Washington if necessary.”

37,Opposition Strengthens to Trump’s Idea of Reopening US by Easter,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/opposition-strengthens-to-trumps-idea-of-reopening-us-by-easter/,"The pushback is increasing across the United States over Donald Trump’s desire to lift the extreme lockdowns and social distancing that have been in place in an effort to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic.
Trump said this week that he wants the nation to get back to work by Easter, despite signs that the pandemic continues to spread unabated, citing concerns for the nose dive that the US economy is taking as a result of the pandemic.
There have been more than 480,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 22,000. 
In the United States, 68,802 have been reported sickened, with 1,037 reported deaths, according to the most recent figures.
“Well, I think that what the president has been saying about getting back at Easter time is both dangerous and immoral,” said Rep. Donna Shalala (R-Fla), who served as secretary of health and human services during the Clinton administration. “And let me say that I know of no — he defies ethical standards. No American believes that we should choose the economy over human life.
“And that’s what’s at stake here. And the president is putting human life at risk because he wants the economy to get back and he simply — it’s literally immoral for him to do that,” she added.
The former mayor of New Orleans, La., echoed those thoughts.
“Listen, Easter is a blessed day for so many people in the world, but it doesn’t really make a whole lot of sense to gather people in God’s name if, in fact, that’s going to hurt us more,” said Mitch Landrieu, who also once served as lieutenant governor of Louisiana. “I mean, God gave us a brain for a reason, and I think that we really have to think about doing three things: one, keeping people away from each other, that is the most important thing; secondly, the recovery package to help the businesses stand up, which Congress passed last night, thank goodness; and third, getting the supplies down to the doctors, especially respirators, so they can care for the people who are going to be sick.”
Dr. Sanjay Gupta, the CNN medical correspondent, said that the medical data just don’t support Trump’s desire.
“Well, look, I think that it’s pretty clear that the numbers are increasing. And the pace at which they’re increasing is also going up. So, you know, it’s kind of like an issue where you not only have the numbers of people who are infected, but the inertia around this outbreak in the United States is also increasing, which is why I think the World Health Organization is concerned this could become the next epicenter,” said Dr Gupta.
“As Dr. Fauci has said, I think every public health official I have talked to, both on and off the record, we want to continuously look at the data, but the data is making it pretty clear, Jim, to answer your question, that it’s going to be several weeks, probably, before we actually are in a position to really start dialing it back,” Dr Gupta said in an on-air report, referring to Anthony Fauci, who is a member of Trump’s federal coronavirus task force. “It is possible that we start to peak within the next few weeks, but that’s maybe not a good thing because you want to actually have this peak come more slowly so you don’t overwhelm the medical system.
“So it’s really still about sort of flattening that curve and delaying that peak as long as possible. The data doesn’t suggest that we’re going to be ready by Easter if you look at it that way,” Gupta added.
More than all that, the late night comedians have turned Trump’s Easter deadline into a ghoulish sort of schtick in their shows.
“We’re now in an extremely dangerous moment where a reckless ruling class and a self-absorbed president are trying to prematurely end the fight against a dangerous pandemic because their stock portfolios are taking a hit. This is sociopathic governance. If you were evaluating the mental competence of our president, you definitely wouldn’t be able to say he’s in… ” Seth Meyers said, before cutting away to a clip of Trump saying:
“Tippy-top shape.”

38,Gov. Cuomo Says the Coronavirus Lockdown Could Last as Long as Nine Months,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/gov-cuomo-says-the-coronavirus-lockdown-could-lasts-as-long-as-nine-months/,"While Donald Trump is talking about lifting the lockdowns and social distancing in place across the United States to try to control the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic by Easter, New York Gov Andrew Cuomo (D) believes that such measures could last for many more months.
In the United States, there have been 54,453 cases of the disease reported, and 737 deaths, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Governors and mayors across the country have closed schools, government offices, restaurants, bars, theaters and other establishments–anywhere where a crowd could assemble and potentially spread the virus.
However, Trump has created controversy this week by saying that he wants those extreme measures to end by Easter.
Public health professionals say that would be harmful to the containment of the virus.
Cuomo, governor of a state which is the site of the most COVID-19 cases in the nation, said that the containment measures must be for the long-haul.
“It’s going to go on for a period of time. This is not a short-term situation. This is not a long weekend. This is not a week. The timeline, nobody can tell you, depends on how we handle it. But 40 percent, up to 80 percent, of the population will wind up getting this virus, all we’re trying to do is slow the spread,” Cuomo said. “But it will spread. It is that contagious. Again, that’s nothing to panic over.”
He added, “We’ll manage at capacity rate. But it’s going to be four months, six months, nine months, you look at China, once they really change the trajectory, which we have not done yet, eight months, we’re in that range. Nobody has a crystal ball. Nobody can tell you, well, I want to know.”

39,‘View’ Co-host Blames Trump’s Businesses Losing Money for His Desire to Re-open by Easter,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/view-co-host-blames-trumps-businesses-losing-money-for-his-desire-to-re-open-by-easter/,"Sonny Hostin, co-host of the ABC daily talk show The View, is placing the blame for Donald Trump’s desire to end the nation’s lockdowns and social distancing by Easter on Trump’s own business losses.
While the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the United States, Trump has told the American people that he wants to end the extreme measures the nation’s mayors and governors have put in place in an attempt to slow the spread of the disease.
There have been more than 430,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 19,000. 
In the United States, there have been 54,453 cases reported, and 737 deaths, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Trump this week has begun saying that he wants to plan to end the business closings and social distancing which have become part of life the last several weeks, saying that further damage to the US economy isn’t worth it.
Hostin, one of the women who hosts The View, alleged that the economic losses are much closer to Trump, and that Trump’s ideas to reopen the country so soon is irresponsible regarding the spread of the disease.
“We can save our grandparents if we just stay at home! That is not too much to ask for, and every single health expert is advising this president to continue to tell people to stay at home. For him to just sort of flout that advice tells me that there is something in it for him, and it tells me that there’s something economic in it for him,” she said. “When you look at Trump’s personal businesses, you know that he is losing almost $500,000 a day because six out of his seven hotels are losing money.
“They are shuttered every day, and that is why our Founding Fathers put the Emoluments Clause into the Constitution, because our president should be more concerned about the lives of Americans rather than lining his own pockets and I think that’s what this is really about!” Hostin added, referring to the part of the US Constitution which prohibits any federal officer–including the president–from receiving gifts or profit from foreign sources.
Separately, CNN medical correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta reported that if Trump’s plans to reopen the country around Easter were followed through on, that all of the precautions that Americans have taken these last weeks would amount to nothing.
“Well, you know, I think the concern is and what you’re hearing from public health officials, I’m hearing the same thing, Jake, is that would put us behind again,” Dr Gupta told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “We’ve been doing the social distancing for about a month at that point, maybe not even quite. If you look at places around the world where they’ve gone through this curve now and had some success thankfully, China, South Korea, places like that, it was an eight to 12 weeks, sort of eight to 10 weeks at least proposition.
“It’s not like one of those things you can do sort of incrementally, as we’ve talked about. If you’re going to do this, you do it early, you do it consistently, you do it honestly, diligently, because if you give up too early, you kind of erase the gains that you’ve made,” Dr Gupta added. “Look, we’re seeing some of the impact of waiting as long as we have now in New York, for example, Washington, California and other places.”

40,Federal Health Officials’ Advice Conflict Over Hydroxychloroquine,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/federal-health-officials-advice-conflict-over-hydroxychloroquine/,"At least two prominent federal public health professionals appear to be offering Americans at least somewhat conflicting advice on the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.
The use of hydroxychloroquine–which is supposed to be used as an anti-malaria drug–as a treatment for the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a controversy since the novel coronavirus outbreak exploded worldwide. Prescribing a drug for a condition that it was not originally intended is called “off-label” prescribing.
Some swear by the prescription of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of the virulent COVID-19 as a miracle drug. Other medical professionals warn that its use is unproven and there are side effects.
Among those who advocate for it are a 52-year-old Florida man who says he recovered from a severe case of the disease after taking the medication, as well as Hollywood actor Daniel Dae Kim.
Fox News host Laura Ingraham had Dr Anthony Fauci, who has been serving as a top coronavirus adviser to Donald Trump, on her nightly program, and specifically asked him about the use of hydroxychloroquine.
“You know what I would do, Laura, there are a number of clinical trials. I’m a believer in a clinical trial,” Dr Fauci replied. “At the same time I want to help myself, I want to get an answer as to what really works or not, so I might take one of those drugs, but I would do it within the auspices of a controlled clinical trial. I’ve always felt that way.”
Ingraham, nevertheless, pressed Dr Fauci on the topic, by trying to emphasize the emergency status of the coronavirus outbreak.
“And so — but you would take one of those drugs because we are getting some positive results and this is — this is wartime, right? It’s not all button down and control, we do what we can do with what we have,” she said.
Dr Fauci wasn’t rattled from his position, however, answering: “I’m not so sure, Laura, just to clarify, that I would necessarily take one of those drugs. I would take a drug that was on a clinical trial. Some of those drugs that you’re mentioning are available within the context of a clinical trial.
“Those same drugs you could probably get from your physician if they be an off label use because they’re already approved for other purposes like malaria and some autoimmune diseases, but myself, personally, I like to get some knowledge out of it, so if I had a situation where I needed a drug, I’d look around and see if there was a clinical trial that would give me access within the contours of a clinical trial.”
Still, Ingraham ended with: “Dr. Fauci, Americans want facts and transparency, but they also want hope, so what hope can you give them tonight?”
“You know, the hope that I give is that right now to just hang on as best as you can, just please implement the recommendations of the guidelines to be able to protect yourself and those around you, avoid crowds, do the things that are on that list that we talk about essentially every night, but also know as time goes by as we test more drugs, as we get better and better in the vaccine — you know, I [said] some time ago that a vaccine is being developed, it still will be quite a while before we have it, but it is conceivable that this may go into another season and if it does, it will bring us that much closer to the possibility of having not only drugs available, but also a vaccine, so that the hope for the future,” Dr Fauci said.
‘I Would Try Anything’
Separately, on his program, Fox News host Sean Hannity interviewed Surgeon General Jerome Adams, specifically about the drugs hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
“It is one of those things where people don’t understand that you can both have helped but still as a scientist or physician who want to verify. And that’s what Dr. Fauci has been saying,” Adams said. “We are hopeful that these medications will work, we have heard some powerful anecdotal stories, but we want to make sure we are tracking what we are seeing right now in New York City’s doctors are prescribing off label because at the end of the day if your loved one is dying, you want to be given the right to try whatever is possible but we also want to track and make sure that works.
“I want to give people a timeline here,” Adams added. “We are looking at a vaccine and may be about a year, looking at a few months hopefully some really good therapeutics with all these trials that are going on across the country and right now, 15 days to stop the spread leaning into the mitigation efforts.”
Like Ingraham, Hannity pressed his guest by painting an emergency scenario: “Would you take hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin if it was you or a family member?”
Adams answered: “If it was me for a family member and they were in the hospital in the ICU, I would try anything that I could to help keep them alive and that’s what we want to get is that opportunity to keep everyone’s loved ones alive.”

41,"Trump Can’t End Social Distancing Alone. Only Governors, Mayors Can Do That",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trump-cant-end-social-distancing-alone-only-governors-mayors-can-do-that/,"Although Donald Trump and other Republicans have begun to talk about ending the extreme lockdowns and social distancing which have become a new way of American life in recent weeks–in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic–the power to do so doesn’t rest with Trump or anyone in the federal government.
The decisions to close everything from schools, to state and local governments, to restaurants, bars, theaters and other establishments–anywhere where crowds could gather–have been made by the nation’s governors and mayors. And the decision to lift them will rest solely with them, as well.
MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell reminded his viewers of that fact on his nightly program.
There have been more than 395,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 17,000.
In the United States, 48,778 cases of the disease have been reported, with 588 deaths, according to the most recent numbers.
Trump, other members of his administration and some other Republicans across the country, have begun saying that the costs to the US economy of maintaining the lockdowns and social distancing is becoming too high for the benefit.
“We can’t let the cure be worse than the problem,” Trump said, referring apparently to the tanking stock markets and a US economy almost sure now to fall into recession, if not worse.
O’Donnell noted that Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading immunologist who has been a member of the federal coronavirus task force, and has often been at Trump’s side during his coronavirus briefings, was not present for this one.
“The White House press corps today chased the idea with the president that he was giving the very clear implication that maybe a week from now the president will declare America all ready to go back to work,” O’Donnell said.
This is despite the fact that officials are warning that the pandemic is likely to continue for perhaps months to come. Indeed, authorities have postponed this year’s Olympic Games scheduled for this summer in Tokyo.
Except that, as much as Trump may want to tell the country to go back to work next week and go out to dinner and a movie afterwards, he can’t do it.
No, really.
He can’t.
“The problem for Donald Trump is that he’s not in charge of this one. Donald Trump has not closed down anything inside the United States. Donald Trump has not closed a single business in this country. Not a single school. He hasn’t closed anything. It’s America’s mayors and county officials and governors who have done that, mostly the governors,” O’Donnell said. “The governors of New York and California have both closed down their states and there is nothing Donald Trump can do about that.
“The governors of New York and California control more economic activity combined than most of the rest of the United States of America put together. And they are not going to reopen their states because of anything that Donald Trump says. Donald Trump didn’t shut down anything. And so Donald Trump cannot reopen anything. Donald Trump is not in charge here. The governors are in charge. And that is good news and that includes Republican governors who have shut down their states.
“Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose state controls more economic activity than any other state, and has more people than any other state, the governor of California will not be listening to anything Donald Trump says about when Gavin Newsom should begin returning California to normal,” O’Donnell added.
“Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York has more coronavirus cases in his state than any other state, and in the biggest city in his state, Gov. Cuomo has a street named Wall Street. And it will be Andrew Cuomo, and not Donald Trump, who decides when New York state and New York City and Wall Street get back to normal,” O’Donnell added. “And luckily for New York, Andrew Cuomo is smart enough to not listen to a word Donald Trump says about that. But Andrew Cuomo has said publicly many times that he is guided by the medical professionals including Dr. Anthony Fauci, who was not present at today’s White House briefing and rally for some reason.”
The Washington Post reported that Dr. Fauci is telling Trump that it is too soon to think about sending people back to work, O’Donnell noted.
“Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the president’s coronavirus task force, and other leading public health experts have told administration officials and Republican lawmakers that prematurely scaling back social distancing measures would hamper efforts to mitigate the virus and would devastate hospitals, according to the people with knowledge of the conversations,” O’Donnell said, quoting from the Post report.
O’Donnell added that, in an interview with Science magazine, published this weekend, Dr. Fauci was asked what it’s like to be standing there in the White House briefing room when Donald Trump says something that is not true. Dr. Fauci said, “I can’t jump in front of a microphone and push him down. Okay, he said it. Let’s try and get it corrected for the next time.”

42,Historian Meacham: ‘We’re the United States of America, We Can Figure Out How To Hold Our Elections’,The BiPartisan Press,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/historian-meacham-were-the-united-states-of-america-we-can-figure-out-how-to-hold-our-elections/,"Americans should not allow the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic to interfere with the 2020 elections, according to noted author and historian Jon Meacham.
Rather, in this time of forced lockdowns and social distancing to slow the spread of the virus, the nation should turn to vote-by-mail, said Meacham, who dubbed the idea “curbside democracy.”
There have been more than 383,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 16,500. 
In the United States, there have been 33,404 recorded cases of the disease, with 400 deaths, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Meacham recently published an op-ed article on this topic in The New York Times.
“It’s very hard constitutionally, legislatively it’s supposed to be impossible for a president to delay, the executive branch to delay a presidential election, only Congress can do it,” Meacham said. “Even then, the president’s term still expires on January 20th. All of that is from a normal world, the place we used to live in. It is like a message in a bottle from America as we’ve known it. I think these are real questions. And I think there are rational, clearly rational concerns. Louisiana, Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio, and others have already postponed their primaries.
“There are ways to do this. Senator Klobuchar, Senator Wyden have a bill. Every American should have access to a mail-in ballot. Colorado has a very good system where they send out ballots, some weeks ahead of the general election. You can mail it back, you can drop it off. It is like curbside democracy,” he added. “Again, to tie all of this together, we’re the United States of America. We can figure out how to hold our elections. It takes some thinking. It’s not easy. But there’s nothing more important.
“And if anybody is lulled at this point, to go to what you were saying, into thinking that there is not some nefarious thinking somewhere, you know, President Trump a year or so ago tweeted — or earlier this year, re-tweeted Jerry Falwell Jr. saying that President Trump should get two more years on his term to make up for the Mueller investigation,” Meacham said. “President Trump has joked at rallies about blowing through the 22nd Amendment.
“It is always a joke until it isn’t, you know? It is always, oh, we’re hyperventilating, clutching our pearls and all that. Sometimes you clutch your pearls because there is a reason to clutch your pearls. I think that this is one of those moments. We just need to look at it. Folks should go online, they should look at how states do this. We need to do it, we need to vote,” Meacham said.

43,State Dem Chair: We Need to See More from Joe Biden,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/state-dem-chair-we-need-to-see-more-from-joe-biden/,"Former vice president Joe Biden really needs to raise his profile and demonstrate some leadership in this time of the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic, according to the head of the Democratic Party in Nebraska.
Biden had just begun pulling away in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination as the full force of the pandemic began to be felt, with enforced lockdowns nationwide and social distancing in order to try to slow the spread of the virus.
There have been more than 383,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 16,500.
In the United States, there have been 33,404 recorded cases of the disease, with 400 deaths, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
“It’s a big problem. I don’t know what is going on in the strategic thinking of Vice President Biden’s team, but I want to see him as a party chair. I also want to see more of Senator [Bernie] Sanders,” said Jane Kleeb, chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party.
“I know he did an amazing live stream that had millions of folks on there where he was connecting with people and making people feel more secure about the coronavirus and things that he’s gonna be doing in the Senate. But I want to see Vice President Biden. I want to see him command the room like [Democratic New York Gov. Andrew] Cuomo and [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom are,” Kleeb added.
Cuomo and Newsom have become well-known, and often reassuring, faces of leadership on television daily as their states have both been hard-hit by the virus, and each have been giving press conferences and briefings which are often carried live nationally.
Cuomo, in particular, has been seen in contrast to Donald Trump and Trump’s own briefings, which are often littered with serious inaccuracies and falsehoods, as well as explosions in anger at the journalists in the briefing.
Cuomo’s leadership has been so popular that the “PresidentCuomo” hashtag was trending on Twitter, and threatened to overshadow the leadership of not only Trump but Biden and Sanders as well.

44,De Blasio Says Coronavirus Will Get Worse Until May: ‘That’s the Blunt Reality’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/de-blasio-says-coronavirus-will-get-worse-until-may-thats-the-blunt-reality/,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) called on the US federal government to provide all struggling states, particularly New York, urgent support.
He declared if vital medical supplies such as ventilators and masks are not sent to New York City within the next few days, hospitals will be unable to support infected patients due to supply shortages, and the COVID-19 outbreak will take lives that could have been saved.
“Every day counts because we’re literally in that very tight window,” de Blasio said Monday on CNN’s New Day. “If we don’t get a supply of ventilators quickly, our public hospital system literally after about a week or so, we will not have enough ventilators to keep people alive who could live through this crisis and could be saved.”
“That’s the blunt reality,” he added.
New York is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, with more cases than any other state. More than 16,000 people have now tested positive in New York, and the state now accounts for approximately five percent of coronavirus cases worldwide, with a significant majority of the cases being within New York City. 

de Blasio warned that the pandemic will not be getting any better in the forthcoming months, rather, it will be getting a lot worse, but he made clear how much worse depends on Washington DC’s response.
“We have to be honest about this, this is just the beginning,” de Blasio stated. “It’s the beginning of something that will get worse throughout April and into May, and we’ve got to brace ourselves and we’ve got to change our lives, and we absolutely need help from Washington.”
He continued, “As this spreads, all of the cities, all of the towns, all of the counties around this country are going to be overwhelmed. The only way they can make it through is with federal help and right now that’s hanging in the balance in Washington.”
An emergency stimulus package, designed by Senate Republicans to lessen the blow to the economy, failed to pass in the Senate Sunday evening. To pass, the bill would have needed 60 votes, but it only received 47.
Democrats argued that the bill prioritizes corporate bailouts over supporting citizens. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said while “changes to the legislation are being made even as we speak,” there were “too many problems in the legislation.”
In contrast, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) heavily criticized Democrats for voting no and delaying the process.
“I want everybody to fully understand if we aren’t able to act [Monday], it’ll be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address this problem,” McConnell remarked.

As de Blasio has been adamant about needing support as soon as possible, New Day co-anchor John Berman asked if he was suggesting “Democrats to drop their objections and just vote yes” to the package.
De Blasio responded saying he was not suggesting this.
The Democrats are “saying we should not prioritize bailouts for the airlines and the big corporations,” de Blasio said. “The first bailout should go to the American people. Millions of people have lost their jobs suddenly. So money back in the pockets of working people, and then help cities, towns, counties, states to be able to handle extraordinary, huge new needs that we simply can’t handle. You’re going to see cities and towns and counties go broke unless there is this direct aid that needs to be in this package, and of course direct aid to hospitals. That’s what Democrats are fighting for.”
De Blasio has also repeatedly stressed that social distancing is the key to delaying the spread of the virus. But despite de Blasio’s view, President Donald Trump, during a coronavirus task force news conference, said after the 15-day shutdown period had ended the government will be re-assessing its strategy. Trump implied that the current social distancing measures will be lessened, and on Sunday evening he tweeted:
WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020
De Blasio strongly cautioned against relaxing social distancing measures, telling Berman that “we have to take these extreme measures.”
“This is a disease that unless you cut of its oxygen if you will, which is to stop people from having all the kind of interaction we are used to as human beings, unless you create social distancing, it moves so fast…that it simply overwhelms any effort by the healthcare community to address it and therefore thousands of lives will be lost that could have been saved,” de Blasio explained.

“How many members of our family, especially our older relatives, who are the people really vulnerable here, are we simply saying as a nation we are going to turn away and ignore the challenges facing them? I don’t think that’s right,” he added. “If coronavirus is not checked in some ways and slowed, then you’re talking about a healthcare system that can’t function at all, including for all the people with other challenges, with all the other healthcare challenges we deal with all the time.”

45,"Fingers Start Pointing to Trump’s Inaction, ‘Fairy Tales’ for Unnecessary COVID-19 Deaths",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/fingers-start-pointing-to-trumps-inaction-fairy-tales-for-unnecessary-covid-19-deaths/,"After weeks that he has been delivering falsehoods and incorrect information to the American people looking for answers in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic–and now growing accusations that he’s not taking enough action–fingers are now pointing to Donald Trump for directly causing unnecessary deaths from the virus.
There have been more than 350,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 15,000.
In the United States, 33,404 have been sickened with a total of 400 deaths reported, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
“Chuck, the truth is, and New Yorkers and all Americans deserve the truth, it’s only getting worse,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in an interview with NBC News host Chuck Todd. “April and May are going to be a lot worse. Right now, we are a third of the cases in the country. That’s going to get worse. We’re about two thirds or more of the cases in New York state. That’s going to get worse.
“But Chuck, the president of the United States is from New York City, and he will not lift a finger to help his hometown. And I don’t get it. I don’t get it,” de Blasio added. “Right now, I have asked repeatedly for the military to be mobilized, for the Defense Production Act to be used to its fullest to get things like ventilators so people who can live who would die otherwise, Chuck, I can’t be blunt enough. If the president doesn’t act, people will die who could have lived otherwise.”
Meanwhile, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow took Trump to task for his multiple instances of misinformation, and broadcasters for being party in disseminating them.
“President Trump today again was just flat out wrong in public about this Malaria drug that has gotten stuck in his mind quite distant from the fact. President Trump said it would be available almost immediately for use,” Maddow said. “Within moments the [Food and Drug Administration] had to clean that up because that is not true at all. It is not at all approved for coronavirus treatment.
“But the president loves saying things like, ‘You know, there’s a drug we’ve got. It’s very effective. It approved already. Everybody is going to get it.’ He loves saying things like that because that would be a lovely thing to tell people, unless of course, that’s not true and telling people a fairytale like that is cruel and harmful and needlessly diverting and wildly irresponsible from anyone in any leadership role.
“It would be wildly irresponsible if someone said that to you from a bar stool, if we could go to bars anymore, but to get it from the presidential podium [it’s worse], nevertheless, he keeps doing it,” she added. “In the weeks leading up to now, we heard claims that the virus was well contained, that it was well under control and would disappear, remember that.
“In terms of material tangible promises, President Trump claimed we would have 1.4 million tests available this week. Of course, we’ve seen nowhere near that. We’ve done a tenth of that. He said Google was developing a website to help people decide if they needed testing and where to go to get it. It would be very quickly done he said unlike websites of the past. Turns out of course, that website is still in the early stages of development and currently only being tested in one part of California and not even really working just for that,” Maddow said. “President Trump announced this week that the Navy was sending two medical ships, one to New York City, one to the West Coast help treat patients. He said the ships would be launched over the next week or so depending on need. Wrong. That was also wrong as NBC’s Courtney Kube puts it: ‘It’s anybody’s guess when those ships will come in.’ One of those ships is currently undergoing maintenance and has no medical personnel on board and the other lacks a medical crew all together. Remember the president said it will be there next week. It won’t be there next week. The president has claimed that the government has ‘massive amounts’ of ventilators. Maybe in normal times, I guess, you might say but in a crisis like this the government’s stockpile of ventilators will not be enough to satisfy the demand. We need literally tens of thousands more than we have. He has said similar things about face masks and other protective equipment for health workers and told a grown up of nurses this past week that the government ordered 500 million N95 respirator masks and declined to mention the order will take 18 months to fill, if we’re lucky. Millions of masks. Don’t worry. Nurses, what are you worrying about? Millions of masks are coming. Wait a year and a half before you might. There is a clear pattern here in this crisis of the president promising stuff he knows America would love to hear but it’s not true. And even stuff that he’s saying that he will do, that the federal government will do, he’s not doing. And so the specific way in which the president is failing now is clear.
“We have said from the very beginning, watch what they do, not what they say. That’s very, very, very relevant here and I say this not to vent my outrage. I’m over that frankly at this point. I’m just saying it because I feel like we should inoculate ourself against the harmful impact of these on going pulse promises and false statements by the president recognizing when he’s talking about the coronavirus epidemic more often than not, he is lying. Even when he’s talking about what he has done or what he will do, he’s consistently lying and giving you happy talk that is stuff that the federal government isn’t actually doing,” she added. “And it’s making people around the country count on the fact the federal government is doing that stuff when they’re not. There may be people in the federal government saying stuff that the not true but it’s a lit knee of things from the president that would be awesome if they were true and happening but they’re not and so the sooner we come to terms with that, I think the better for all of us.
“If it were up to me and it’s not, I would stop putting those briefings on live TV. Not out of spite but because it’s misformation. If the president does end up saying anything true, you can run it as tape. But if he keeps lying like he has been every day on stuff this important, all of us should stop broadcasting it,” Maddow said. “Honestly, it’s going to cost lives. Honestly, it’s going to cost lives.”

46,Trump Activates National Guard to Handle Coronavirus: ‘We’re at War’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/coronavirus/trump-activates-national-guard-to-handle-coronavirus-were-at-war/,"Speaking at the Coronavirus Task Force Briefing Sunday, President Donald Trump announced he was activating the National Guard in the states of New York, California, and Washington, where the virus has hit the hardest, to help fight the spread of the coronavirus.
Trump said that the respective governors of those states would retain command over the National Guard, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would pay for 100 percent of costs, freeing up state resources.

“This will give them maximum flexibility to use the guard against the virus without having to worry about cost or liability, and freeing up state resources to protect the health and safety of the people in their state.”
In addition, he announced the deployment of new supplies and beds to assist with the coronavirus response.
“We have large quantities of medical equipment and supplies on the way, based on all of this, to the states, including respirators, surgical masks and gowns, coveralls, and gloves already delivered to Washington and to New York. In addition to large quantities of supplies, I’ve directed FEMA to supply the following: four large medical stations with 1,000 beds for New York, eight large medical stations with 2,000 beds for California, and three large federal medical stations, and four small medical stations with 1000 beds for the state of Washington.“
According to Trump, the placement of those medical centers would be based on “the governor’s request.”
“We send the resource to them and they will put it to best use. They will put it to where they will have the most effect. We do not dictate where it goes […] again it is a request from the state to the federal government and the governor can use that as he or she sees fit.”

The National Guard is composed mostly of people who hold a civilian job and serve in the National Guard part-time. The deployment of the National Guard will currently be used mainly to deliver supplies as well as help coordinate medical centers.
Then, aligning with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s and New York City Mayor’s “war mentality,” President Trump described the coronavirus and its economic impact as “war.”
“I want to assure the American people that we’re doing everything we can each day to ultimately defeat this horrible, invisible enemy. We’re at war. In a true sense, we’re at war and we’re an invisible enemy.”
“We have to help the workers. We have to save the companies because as soon as we’re finished with this war, our country is going to bounce back like you’ve never seen before. but we have to get it to that position and we have to make sure those companies are whole, that they haven’t been disbanded.”
Previously, Gov. Cuomo had called for more federal aid for New York, which has been hit the hardest by the coronavirus.

“I think the federal government should order factories to manufacture masks, gowns, ventilators, the essential medical equipment that is going to make the difference between life and death,” he said on Sunday. “It’s not hard to make a mask or PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) equipment or a gown, but you need companies to do it.”
Senator Gary Peters (D-Mich.) said this Friday that many companies in his state are ready to transition temporarily to manufacturing ventilators and other medical equipment to help fight the coronavirus, but they “need direction from the administration.”

47,"AOC Wants “Universal” Economic Stimulus Plan, but Also to “Tax It Back” from Rich",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/aoc-wants-universal-economic-stimulus-plan-but-also-to-tax-it-back-from-rich/,"The stimulus package plan, announced by Senate Republicans, aims to provide financial security for citizens during the pandemic, in a time of shutdowns, job losses, and isolation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared the plan an “a bold legislative proposal” which will provide “direct financial help for the American people” and “rapid relief for small businesses and their employees.”
The package includes direct check payments up to $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples, with the amount based on adjusted gross income. For every child, the sum will rise by an additional $500. It will also include expanded unemployment insurance.

At present, the stimulus package is currently being negotiated in Congress.
On Sunday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) addressed the stimulus package and commented that although the package will offer more unemployment benefits, it does not provide enough support to workers such as freelancer workers and contract workers.
“One of the issues here, is, of course, we need to be expanding unemployment, but there are a lot of workers in our economy that will not be covered by unemployment because they’re hourly workers, they’re gig workers, they’re freelance and contract workers. And unemployment does not cover those workers, even though they’re essentially unemployed right now, their contracts are frozen up or their hours are drastically slashed but not completely slashed,” Ocasio-Cortez explained during CNN’s State of the Union program.
She said that to ensure all citizens are able to sustain themselves financially, everyone should receive direct payments, and the following year the money paid to the wealthy can be recovered through taxes.
“I do think it should be universal,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I hear the argument of people saying, why are you going to give a check to Bill Gates. One of the things that we’re saying is, tax it back a year from now so you don’t have to worry about a big complicated bureaucratic means test upfront, mail them out to everybody and let’s get it back from the folks that don’t need it next year.”
When asked by CNN’s State of the Union host Jake Tapper how much money did she think the government needs be sending directly to the public, Ocasio-Cortez responded by praising the plan suggested by the Financial Services Committee. Their plan involves sending $2,000 this month to every American and an extra $1,000 per child, while also pausing debts, rent payments, and mortgage payments.
“I’m very supportive of both those measures,” she remarked. “When you’re able to stop the money going out, then that money that you do give goes a much longer way.”

Speaking to Tapper, Ocasio-Cortez, who previously worked in the service industry as a bartender, expressed her concern for service workers who may be having their hours slashed, no tips due to a lack of customers, and even risk losing their jobs because of business closures.
“From the moment that the business closures started happening, I’ve been very scared for a lot of these workers. All I can think about is what I would have done just two or three years ago.”
Economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the new measures to combat the pandemic could total over $2 trillion, and the package is equal to approximately 10 percent of U.S. economic output.
However, Ocasio-Cortez stated that this amount is not enough, especially as the package includes corporate bailouts.

“If all of this money is going to bailing out the airline industry in a way that does not help workers, if it’s going to bailing out banks and other industries without helping workers, then it’s not going to be enough and in fact, it could be too big. So it’s really about how we’re using these funds,” she noted.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at this point in time there is no confirmed deal regarding the stimulus package: “from my standpoint, we are apart.”

48,"Senate Democrats on Coronavirus: If You Lose Your Job ‘for Any Reason,’ Dems Want to Give You Full Pay",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/senate-democrats-on-coronavirus-if-you-lose-your-job-for-any-reason-dems-want-to-give-you-full-pay/,"With lawmakers and Trump administration officials agreeing that their massive rescue package for a US economy reeling from the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic could reach $2 trillion dollars, discussions remain as to just what that legislation could look like.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has put out a marker, however, that Senate Democrats expect it to include funds to provide full salaries for up to six months to all Americans who lose their jobs, as part of a multi-part plan.
Washington policymakers have been scrambling to help the ailing economy since the stock markets began tanking weeks ago in reaction to the virus spread, with predictions the US unemployment rate could skyrocket to 20 percent as a result of forced business closings and quarantine conditions to enforce social distancing to try to stop the spread of the disease.
Confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide have now topped 300,000. In the United States, the latest numbers are 26,908 sickened and 348 left dead.
To address the economic fallout, Senate Democrats have a plan that they call “Workers First,” Schumer said during a segment of Joy Reid’s MSNBC program.
“We want the help to go just to the people who use it, who are losing their jobs and have to pay monthly bills not just the one-time shot of money and then what do they do next month when they have a mortgage or a rent or food? So let me show, we have five major points,” he said. “There are many more but let me give you the five.
“First, we beef up unemployment insurance in a huge way that’s never been done before. We call it ‘unemployment on steroids’ or ’employment insurance.’ You lose your job because of this crisis or any other reason, the federal government will pay you your full salary for four to six months,” Schumer said. “We’re trying to get six for the whole time and that way you will have money every month, you will have money at the same level you were making before and you will be able to at least pay your bills and then if the crisis is over you’ll go back to your old job because you’ll have your bills, the company will just furlough you and that will work.
“Second, a massive amount of money for health care. Our hospitals are hurting. And they need huge amounts of equipment, they need huge amounts of masks and the workers in those hospitals, I’ve spoken to the head of the nurses union. They need all kinds of help,” he added. “They’re asking them to work longer hours. They’re asking them to work without the proper protective gear. Massive infusion of money to hospitals and by the way, to state and local governments which are hurting.
“Third and … any money that goes to these big industries has to go to the workers. We are going to demand of the airlines, you can’t lay off a single worker, you can’t cut the benefits, you can’t cut the salary, you can’t cut any of this for any worker,” Schumer continued. “We’re going to work on — I’ve been talking to some of my friends here in New York with these workers that they farmed out, you know, you clean toilets for minimum wage because it’s a contractor, not the airline, no way. And another thing, no buybacks. It just infuriates me, Joy, that these airlines between 2015 and 2019 did $45 billion in buybacks and now they say they have no money. Those buybacks went to the wealthy shareholders, not a nickel to productivity or et cetera.
“And paid sick leave, paid family leave. People need it. If you have to stay home because you’re sick or a loved one is sick, you ought to be paid and finally we’d like to help the students and so what we’re saying — we’re trying to get them working with Elizabeth Warren on this, a portion of your loans, not just the interest, but the principal is forgiven during this crisis,” Schumer added. “Students are losing school. They may have to go back for extra terms and extra courses. They should be made whole too. There’s many more things in this, but as you can see it’s a ‘workers first’ plan, period.”

49,"Gov. Cuomo Gets Coronavirus Testing Decentralized for NY, Acquires N95 Masks",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/coronavirus/gov-cuomo-gets-coronavirus-testing-decentralized-for-ny-acquires-n95-masks/,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), held a press conference Saturday on the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic, where he addressed topics relating to testing protocol and his handling of the situation and plans. 
Cuomo declared that there are now more than 10,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York state alone. He explained that this spike was due to more tests being performed, as the testing capacity has swiftly increased since the process became decentralized. 

Cuomo had previously called on President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to decentralize the testing process and give states greater authority. Last week, the Trump administration provided permission for New York state to authorize local labs to conduct testing. Since this action, the testing capacity in New York has increased to 6,000 per day, a drastic difference from before, where only around 3,000 tests had been conducted since the first case.
“I spoke to the president and the vice president, and I said, ‘Decentralize the testing, let the states do it,’” Cuomo said. “I have 200 labs. I can mobilize quickly. Let us do the tests. They agreed. We’re doing more tests than any state. So, for example, we’ve done 45,000 tests. California has done 23,000. Washington has done 23,000.”
“We are testing more than any state in the United States of America. We are testing more per capita than China and Korea,” he added.
Cuomo emphasized that it is a great accomplishment and a promising development, as a larger testing capacity will mean a better chance at controlling and slowing the spread of the virus.
“We were all starting at the same place and for us to come up to scale that quickly and get to a scale where we’re doing more than anyone else, that was great,” he noted.
Cuomo also made clear that although some citizens have been questioning if he has been tested, he has not and will not be – unless he meets the testing protocol criteria.
“I’ve not been exposed to anyone who is positive. I don’t have a fever, I don’t have any symptoms, and I don’t want to waste a test,” he said.
When asked if it was a concern that two major hospitals in Albany, NY, were telling the public that even if they showed symptoms, in order to save tests for health care workers, they would not be able to test them, Cuomo dismissed this. He argued that they were doing everything they possibly could to test those who fit the criteria.

“The hospital — we are testing by the same protocol all across the state,” Cuomo explained. “If you meet that protocol, then you get a test. And it’s on the website. If you have been exposed to someone positive, if you are showing symptoms, if you meet that protocol, you get a test…So yes, no state — no country can give everybody a test who wants a test.”
He then advised that even if it was possible, testing everyone should not be the goal.
“This is not just I want a test to make myself feel better. It won’t even make you feel better because okay you didn’t have — you tested negative at 10:00 AM, but then you went and you talked to six people, maybe you’re positive again. You’ll never solve that neurosis, right. That anxiety.”
Discussing the current approach and measures, Cuomo disclosed that he had secured two million N95 respirator masks, with one million for New York City.
New York City is the coronavirus hot zone; around 6,200 out of the 10,000 confirmed cases in New York have been recorded in the city.
“The medical community has told me over and over again, the masks are the priority for the COVID-19. So we have made progress on masks,” Cuomo said. “One million masks won’t get us through the crisis, but it will make a significant contribution to New York City’s mask issue.”
Cuomo also claimed the state is working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assemble four field hospitals, which will have a capacity for up to 1,000 infected patients.

“The field hospitals are done by the FEMA. They are equipped hospitals that do 250 people each. They’re basically a tent configuration, with beds, with medical equipment, with staff. And they come 250-bed capacities. We requested four of those,” he remarked.
On Friday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced that the Federal Emergency Mangement Agency (FEMA) have issued a Major Disaster Declaration for New York, making $42 billion in aid accessible from the Disaster Relief Fund.

50,"Fmr. Labor Sec’y: No Bailouts For Big Companies, Trump Admin Should Use Money To Help Regular People",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/fmr-labor-secy-no-bailouts-for-big-companies-trump-admin-should-use-money-to-help-regular-people/,"As lawmakers on Capitol Hill and officials in the Trump administration continue to hash out the specific contours of what an economic package will look like to respond to the downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic, debate continues over how much of this potentially $1 trillion or more legislation will be devoted to aid to big industry versus direct aid to the American people.
Just in the United States, 15,219 have been sickened, and 201 have died, according to the latest numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Figures are much higher worldwide.
Meanwhile, US stock markets have tanked in recent weeks, as the effects of the disease outbreak have become well-known.
“By now it is clear there must be and will be some sort of enormous federal rescue package to stem some of the economic destruction we’re currently undergoing. There’s no shortage of ideas floating around,” said MSNBC host Chris Hayes. “President Trump for one seems focused on bailing out big industries including hotels, a type of property he himself owns. Senate Republicans unveiled a plan for a trillion dollars of payments. With less money for the bottom 70 million tax filers.”
Given that the way out of this crisis seems to be social distancing and quarantine conditions, any economic rescue legislation ought to focus on direct help to average people, not the sort of massive corporate bailouts which were common after the 2008 financial meltdown, according to Robert Reich, former labor secretary in the Clinton administration, and a popular progressive activist in the decades since.
“This crisis demands that people stay home. We want to make it so that employers and employees have every possibility of staying home and getting the kind of income support they need as fast as possible,” Reich said. “No bailouts to companies, particularly big companies. Big companies can get the loans they need at almost zero interest rates.
“Big companies got a huge tax break just two years ago that they used to basically buy back their shares of stock and give big investors and executives a field day,” he added, referring to the Republican-passed tax reform legislation. “No, you don’t want that. Save the taxpayer money. Make sure it’s used for people who need it to stay home and maintain their incomes while they’re home.”

51,‘I Am Frightened That the Hospitals Across the Country Will Be Running Out of Supplies’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/i-am-frightened-that-the-hospitals-across-the-country-will-be-running-out-of-supplies/,"As the coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic continues to mushroom across the United States and abroad, the fear is growing that healthcare systems simply will become overwhelmed by the demand.
For instance, Washington Post sports columnist Sally Jenkins has taken the stance that the only responsible course now is to cancel this year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo, after consulting with a friend of hers who is an emergency doctor.
“Things are accelerating. Cases in New York are doubling overnight. There were more than 275,000 cases worldwide as of Saturday, and while it took three months to count the first 100,000 infections, it took just 12 days to reach the 200,000 mark,” Jenkins wrote. “Hong Kong has reported its single biggest jump in cases to date, apparently because people are still traveling. Get it? The disease is speeding up because we aren’t shutting down fast enough.
“We don’t have time for athletes to keep training or meeting with coaches, risking infection or becoming asymptomatic spreaders,” she added.
The name of the game, as Jenkins points out, is to buy time. In just province of Italy, more than 100 physicians of 600 are ill.
“We’re acting like we have time, and we don’t,” her doctor friend said.
Meanwhile, Dr. Dave Campbell, medical correspondent at NBC News, fears that US hospitals could soon find themselves overwhelmed.
“I am frightened that the hospitals across the country will be running out of supplies, overrun with patients that are testing positive to coronavirus, COVID-19 disease, and that we will be running short of ventilators, and perhaps most importantly, the personnel that will be required to treat the patients that are sick, the healthcare workers will themselves become infected periodically and then they’ll need to stay away from other patients, or they will get sick enough to stay in a hospital bed,” Dr Campbell said.
“So we have this conundrum that is going to make us look like Italy if we don’t, all across the country, socially distance, and if there is even time to do that. But it is better to do that than not,” he added, in an on-air segment with MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski. “So I’m quite concerned, Mika, that in the next two to four weeks, we will be having different discussions.”

52,"Trump Completely Loses It on NBC’s Peter Alexander, Who Says, I Was Trying to Toss Him a ‘Softball’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trump-completely-loses-it-on-nbcs-peter-alexander-who-says-i-was-trying-to-toss-him-a-softball/,"Donald Trump took his hatred of the press to a new level Friday, even while he is ostensibly supposed to be uniting the country during this difficult time of coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic.
Trump unloaded on NBC News reporter Peter Alexander in the White House briefing room, while Alexander maintains that he was actually only trying to offer Trump the chance to answer a “softball,” or easy, question designed to demonstrate leadership.
The outbreak continues to take its toll, as there have been more than 275,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 175,000 cases still active. The virus has killed more than 11,000 worldwide.
In the United States, 15,219 have been sickened, and 201 have died, according to the latest numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The confrontation began when Alexander asked the president, “What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now, who are scared?”
Trump exploded in response: “I say that you’re a terrible reporter. That’s what I say. Go ahead. I think it’s a very nasty action and I think it’s a very bad signal that you’re putting out to the American people. The American people are looking for answers and they’re looking for hope, and you’re doing sensationalism.
Trump continued the tirade: “And the same with NBC and Comcast. I don’t call — I don’t call it Comcast, I call it Con-cast, for whom you work. Let me just tell you something. That’s really bad reporting. And you want to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism. Let’s see if it works. It might and it might not. I happen to feel good about it, but who knows? I’ve been right a lot.”
Alexander came back on the air later, to discuss the encounter with NBC and MSNBC host Chuck Todd, who asked whether Trump’s unraveling was potentially due to the stress that he’s under during the crisis.
“Is the pressure getting to the president here? He seems very defensive. particularly — I think we saw a great example of it at the end,” Todd said. “Dr. [Anthony] Fauci gave a straightforward honest answer about the testing challenges that have been a problem from the get-go here. And the president, you could see him goose the vice president, ‘Don’t you want to answer that?’ Then the president came in with suddenly a new spin on what happened there. Is the pressure getting to him?”
“Well, I think Americans will make their own judgment based on what they saw here, Chuck,” Alexander replied. “Obviously they are looking for a president and a task force in whom they can be confident and feel safe and secure knowing that everything’s being done to help protect them at home right now. As you witnessed, there was a moment, you and I are baseball fans, we call it a ‘softball,’ trying to provide the president an opportunity to reassure millions of Americans who are witnessing the death toll now approach 200 and the number of those who have already tested positive for COVID-19 approaching 14,000 or surpassing it. What he would say to Americans who were scared?
“The president, as you witnessed, instead took it out on me and said that I was a terrible reporter. I mean clearly this was an opportunity for him to be positive and to be uplifting, optimistic as he likes to be. I asked him before that, which I think frustrated him perhaps, is whether it’s his sort of impulse to put a positive spin on things, is that maybe giving false hope to Americans,” Alexander added. “As we witnessed just yesterday, he said about some of those possible therapies that he — that there would be immediate delivery. In fact, Dr. Fauci himself said there was no magic drug for coronavirus.
“But just to really underscore this moment, I asked the same question, Chuck, as you witnessed, of the vice president about an hour later in that briefing and he provided the answer that frankly a lot of Americans at home, my neighbors with whom I speak are looking for, which is, to the question of should Americans be afraid, should they be scared, he said, ‘Don’t be afraid. Be vigilant.’ Chuck?” Alexander said.
Todd ended the segment by saying, “Peter, on behalf of all of my colleagues, all of our colleagues, I want to thank you for your professionalism and the way you do represent NBC News and the Comcast family in that room. I wish people on the other side of the podium had the same professionalism as well. So thank you, Peter.”
The explosive confrontation was so noteworthy as to attract attention and discussion on competing news outlets, including CNN, where host John King backed Alexander.
“The American people are looking for answers, they do want hope, they do want support, Mr. President,” King said, addressing Trump directly. “That was a very fair question. 
“Kaitlin, this is a Trump trademark, it was striking that this came, this, forgive me, bullshit attack on fake news came just moments after the secretary of state said the American people needed to be careful about where they get their information, and go to sources they can trust,” King added.

53,"Tulsi Gabbard, What Could Have Been and What May Yet Be",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/tulsi-gabbard-what-could-have-been-and-what-may-yet-be/,"The coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic apparently have claimed a surprising casualty: Democrat Tulsi Gabbard finally suspended her presidental campaign which has long been largely inert anyway.
In one sense, she’s only finally acknowledging reality, given that she hasn’t qualified for a Democratic presidential debate since November, and has won only the tiniest handful of the delegates needed to win the nomination.
Given that Gabbard is not running for re-election to her congressional seat representing Hawaii, her future is certainly open and uncertain.
It’s a somewhat ignominious end to what could have been a soaring future.
She is a woman who is a military veteran who served her country with honor, and–like me–is a practitioner of an Eastern religion. Plus she had stood out in 2016 as a prominent Bernie Sanders supporter. She could have written her ticket.
Early on, I was ready to back her enthusiastically.
Then I began to learn disquieting things. She met with Trump officials after the 2016 election about a potential spot in the administration.
In fact, as I dug deeper, I found that Gabbard often sounded more like Donald Trump, happy to criticize President Barack Obama.
If you look online, you will find all manner of conservative and right-wing folks politically in love with Gabbard, practically begging Democrats to nominate her.
And as the campaign wore on, she seemed strangely eager to appear regularly on Fox News, not an outlet known for its Democratic viewership.
Needless to say, the more conservatives may have been excited, progressives–certainly this one–became turned off.
Which brings us to Gabbard’s present and future.
Were all of those appearances on Fox News truly just an extended audition to become one more member of the network’s stable of on-air talent?
Are we in store for a party switch and a move to somewhere more conservative-friendly than the deep-blue Aloha State for another shot at elective office?
Or, will Gabbard follow the footsteps of another washed up politician and end up in a decade–on a goofy TV series like Masked Singer, like Sarah Palin?

54,"de Blasio: US Military Should Aid Coronavirus Crisis, Not Keep Building the Border Wall",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/de-blasio-us-military-should-aid-coronavirus-crisis-not-keep-building-the-border-wall/,"Donald Trump should have the US military intervene on behalf of helping alleviate the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic, not still stuck at the southern border building a wall, according to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D).
There have been more than 240,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 140,000 cases still active. The virus has killed more than 10,000.
In the United States, there have been 10,442 reported cases, with 150 deaths, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“Savannah, I spent a few weeks trying to reassure New Yorkers, because we did have a lot of capacity, we do have a lot of capacity, but at this point, with the trajectory of the disease, we have to be honest,” de Blasio said in an interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie.
“If there’s not a profound federal intervention quickly to ensure that we have more ventilators, we have more surgical masks, all the basic supplies, if the federal government does not get involved quickly and specifically the United States military — I spoke to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff yesterday, the military has an extraordinary medical capacity, it’s needed in places like New York right now,” the mayor added. “But it’s quite clear that the administration in Washington has not mobilized the American military. There are American military officers right now still building a wall at the southern border when all they should be doing domestically is addressing Coronavirus.
“We need their medical resources, their logistical know-how, we need them to help ensure that food and medicine moves around this country and our supply chain is not disrupted. Right now we are in the midst of a crisis we have not seen for generations, Savannah, and yet the American military is being sidelined when they should be given the chance to get in this game and help us all,” he added.
Trump has been diverting military funds since last year under authority of a “state of emergency” he declared, in order to build the wall along the southern border which he has long craved–and once promised Mexico would pay for.
de Blasio, separately, also criticized Trump for not doing enough, calling him “the Herbert Hoover of [his] generation,” referring to US president criticized for not doing enough in the face of the Great Depression nearly a century ago.
“You are not using the tools of your office. This is one of the greatest emergencies our nation has faced in generations. Every tool must be brought to bear,” de Blasio said, as if speaking to Trump.

55,Trump Continues To Stand at the Podium Daily and Says Untrue Things About Coronavirus,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trump-continues-to-stand-at-the-podium-daily-and-says-untrue-things-about-coronavirus/,"Despite declaring himself a “wartime president” amidst the spread of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, Donald Trump continues to prove detrimental at the presidental podium, according to some expert observers.
There have been more than 240,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 140,000 cases still active. The virus has killed more than 10,000.
In the United States, there have been 10,442 reported cases, with 150 deaths, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trump has come under fire since the virus first arrived in the United States, often making statements with inaccurate information, often off-the-cuff, on-camera to the American people, or simply spouting falsehoods which could the lives of Americans in danger in this uncertain time.
That continues to this day, according to Ron Klain, who served as the United States Ebola response coordinator in late 2014 into early 2015.
“It’s been nine days without a briefing from the Centers for Disease Control, and that’s extraordinary in kind of normal times. But I don’t know, whatever is beyond extraordinary in a public health crisis,” he said. “They are the nation’s public health authorities, and they are the ones who we should be hearing from. President Trump stands at that podium every day and says things that are untrue. He says that cures are coming that aren’t really coming, vaccines are coming that aren’t really coming, that Google has built some website that they haven’t really built, that you can get tests when you can’t really get them. So people can’t rely on that information. We need to hear CDC tell us accurate information on a timely basis.”
Trump simply is not giving straight answers to basic questions about the coronavirus response, Mika Brzezinski, host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, said during Andrea Mitchell’s program.
“Andrea, I think the key takeaway from what we just saw is that we’re a country still flat-footed in the fight against a deadly virus that is spreading across the country,” she said. “You go to this news conference, you want to hear the latest. You want to ask questions about the latest on testing, on supplies, like masks and ventilators, and you’ve got sort of long, rambling tirades from the president going all over the place talking about fantastic remedies that will be unbelievable like nothing ever seen before, and none of it is imminent.
“None of it is now. None of it is any time soon and there are no masks, and we have the CDC website guidance giving guidance to make your own. That’s where we are,” Brzezinski added.
Meanwhile, Trump also simply isn’t doing all he could to assist the nation at this time, according to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D).
“I will only say to the president: ‘I don’t understand.’ And I think there are millions and tens of millions of Americans who don’t understand what you are doing right now. You are not using the tools of your office. This is one of the greatest emergencies our nation has faced in generations. Every tool must be brought to bear,” de Blasio said.
“For some reason, you continue to hesitate. I said it not to be flip, but to note the historical parallel. President Trump, right now you are the Herbert Hoover of your generation. You are watching and waiting and missing every chance to be bold and to act to protect our nation,” he added.

56,Colbert on Biden’s Democratic Primary Wins: ‘Good Old-fashioned Butt-Kicking’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/coronavirus/colbert-on-bidens-democratic-primary-wins-good-old-fashioned-butt-kicking/,"The COVID-19 outbreak has spread rapidly across the world, forcing many to self-isolate and practice social distancing. Globally there are now over 220,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and the total death toll is almost at 10,000.
Although the pandemic started in Asia, last week the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that Europe has now become the epicenter of the pandemic.
“The number of cases of coronavirus reported every day in Europe has surpassed China at its peak,” Health and Science Correspondent James Gallagher noted.

The United States is also experiencing a rapid increase of confirmed cases, with the number now soaring above 10,000. While elderly people are considered the most vulnerable age group, a recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that 38 percent of those in the United States who were being hospitalized due to the virus, were aged between 20 and 54, meaning younger people are still at risk for developing severe conditions.
“I think everyone should be paying attention to this,” remarked professor of epidemiology Stephen Morse. “It’s not just going to be the elderly. There will be people age 20 and up. They do have to be careful, even if they think that they’re young and healthy.”
The virus has even infected members of Congress, with Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Ben McAdams (R-Utah) revealing on Wednesday they had tested positive for the virus.
Due to the pandemic, some late-night shows, such as The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, have suspended production in order to ensure the safety of staff. Despite this, Stephen Colbert has continued hosting his show from home, referring to the new content as “special social-distancing” editions.

On the latest home show, Colbert addressed how West Virginia announced its first confirmed case this Tuesday, meaning all 50 states now have cases of the virus. He also pointed out that ironically, just before the discovery, Donald Trump had praised West Virginia Gov Jim Justice (R) for “doing a great job” of keeping the virus out of the state.
“The coronavirus continues to be everywhere,” Colbert said. “After Trump made a big deal about it not being in West Virginia, last night we found out that West Virginia is the 50th state to report a coronavirus case. So now we are all in this together.”
Colbert further went on to criticize the clash between New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), who took opposing stances regarding enforcing a shelter in place order. 

Although de Blasio said, “New Yorkers should be prepared right now for the possibility of a shelter in place order,” Cuomo refuted this claim at a news briefing.
“We hear ‘New York City is going to quarantine itself.’ That is not true. That cannot happen. It cannot happen legally. No city in the state can quarantine itself without state approval. And I have no interest whatsoever and no plan whatsoever to quarantine any city,” Cuomo stated.
“Mayor de Blasio, Governor Cuomo, the nation is in crisis, this is no time for a pissing match,” Colbert joked. 
Colbert then touched on the Democratic primaries that took place in Arizona, Illinois, and Florida. He called it a “good old-fashioned butt-kicking,” as Joe Biden won all of the primaries, beating Bernie Sanders in Florida by nearly 40 points. Currently, Biden is in the lead at 1,181 delegates while Sanders is behind at 885, with many now speculating that Sanders will drop out of the race.

There are concerns about what will happen to the Democratic primary election amid the pandemic, with some states that haven’t voted yet delaying their primaries and most large rallies and events being canceled.
Coming to the end of his home show broadcast, Colbert finished his talk with an inspiring and hope-filled message to his viewers in a time of pandemic anxiety.
“Everywhere you look, people are looking after each other,” Colbert said. “Getting food or cleaning supplies for their neighbors, regardless of what that neighbor’s politics are. Democrat, Republican, socialist — it doesn’t matter right now. We can still disagree about many things, but this crisis has driven home — literally, home — the truth that this is one great nation, united by our belief in, and our need for, each other.”

57,"Miami Springbreakers Defend Partying, But Some Young Coronavirus Patients Have Decreased Lung Function",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/miami-springbreakers-defend-partying-but-some-young-coronavirus-patients-have-decreased-lung-function/,"The massive warnings for “social distancing” to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus and the COVID-19 pandemic seem to be working as Americans adjust to life with shuttered restaurants, schools, theaters and other venues wherever crowds might gather.
However not all are paying heed.
For instance, a Louisiana pastor defied a state order and held a church service for hundreds of people.
However, perhaps no one has been more flagrant in thumbing their noses at the idea of social distancing than the young people who have insisted on going on with their Spring Break plans in Miami.
“If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I’m not going to let it stop me from partying,” said one Spring Breaker. “You know, I’ve been waiting — we’ve been waiting for Miami Spring Break for a while, about two months we’ve had this trip planned, two, three months, and we’re just out here having a good time. Whatever happens, happens.”
“It’s really messing up with my Spring Break. What is there to do here other than go to the bars or the beach? And they’re closing all of it,” complained another partier. “I think they’re blowing it way out of proportion. I think it’s doing way too much.”
Although these revelers are approaching the situation with the indestructibility typical of young people, that sense may well be misplaced, according to CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Dr Sanjay Gupta.
The COVID-19 pandemic can cause lasting damage in its young victims, Dr Gupta said.
“A lot of what we heard initially out of China, very early data was that, you know, this was primarily something that just affected older people. As more and more people have been infected around the world, a clear picture of this virus and what it does is emerging,” he said. “For example, some of the young people who contracted the virus in China recovered, now they’re being examined a month, two months later and they’re finding that in some of those patients they have 20 to 30 percent decreased lung function.
“They have evidence of scarring in the lungs which is, you know, a more permanent form of damage. They are listed as recovered, that’s true, they are recovered, but it definitely left its toll on some of these young people as well,” Gupta added. “So recovery doesn’t mean they didn’t get sick and I think it’s a really important point.”

58,"‘This Is a Bat Virus, Not a China Virus; It Doesn’t Speak Chinese’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/this-is-a-bat-virus-not-a-china-virus-it-doesnt-speak-chinese/,"Although the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 222,000 people and has killed more than 9,000 worldwide, once had its origins in Wuhan, China, the virus and the COVID-19 pandemic it’s caused has spread across the globe.
Although the pandemic is hitting hard in places as far flung as Italy, Iran and the United States, Donald Trump and other US politicians on the right continue to insist on calling the coronavirus the “Chinese virus.”
Trump defended his characterization in a back-and-forth with a reporter.
“Because it comes from China. It’s not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China, that’s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate,” Trump said.
“Aren’t you concerned about the Chinese Americans in this country? Your aides behind you, are you comfortable with the term?” the reporter asked.
“I have great love for all the people from our country. But as you know, China tried to say at one point — maybe they’ve stopped now — that it was caused by American soldiers,” Trump said. “That can’t happen. It’s not going to happen. Not as long as I’m president. It comes from China.”
Trump has been known for using divisive and racially inflammatory rhetoric since he first began running for president.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) to task for also referring to the virus as “Chinese.”
Richard Engel, chief foreign correspondent for NBC News, made it very clear in an on-air report that the virus is not a “Chinese virus.”
“It’s easy to scapegoat people. And that is what has always happened when there have been pandemics or epidemics, that foreigners are attacked, foreigners sometimes physically attacked,” Engel said.
“If you look at what happened during the Middle Ages, there was lots and lots of scapegoating against an ethnic group or a religious group whenever there were pandemics that affected the society and threatened a lot of people. And China certainly feels that is what happened, what is happening now, with people calling it the Wuhan flu or the Wuhan virus or the China virus,” Engel added.
“This is a virus that came from the territory of China, but came from bats,” Engel said. “This is a bat virus, not a China virus. It doesn’t speak Chinese, it doesn’t target Chinese people, it targets human beings who happen to touch their eyes, their nose or mouth.”

59,"Mark Cuban Calls on Fed to Print Unlimited Money, Ignore Consequences For Now",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/mark-cuban-calls-on-fed-to-print-unlimited-money-ignore-consequences-for-now/,"Globally there are around 200,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 8,000 deaths so far. In the United States alone, the number of deaths has exceeded 100.
Coronavirus is now present in all U.S. states, and the United States is adjusting to combat the spread, transitioning to stricter lockdown measures. Across states, many stores, restaurants, and public schools have shut, and most large events have been canceled. New York has banned all mass gatherings, and New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has shut down all clubs, cinemas, theaters, and event venues in the city. He also told restaurants and bars to close to dine-in customers and to only sell food via delivery.
“Our lives are all changing in ways that were unimaginable just a week ago,” definitely de Blasio said. “This is not a decision I make lightly. These places are part of the heart and soul of our city.”

Those who display symptoms or have been in contact with someone infected must self-isolate, as well as those who are more vulnerable to the virus, such as the elderly and individuals who have underlying health issues. All citizens are expected to practice social distancing.
Notably, President Donald Trump recently extended the Europe travel ban to the United Kingdom and Ireland, after a surge of cases in the United Kingdom. Currently, in the United Kingdom there are nearly 3,000 confirmed cases, but the government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, estimated that in reality there could be over 50,000 cases undetected.
Due to the pandemic, which has led to fears that a global recession could occur, the U.S. economy has been hit by blow after blow.

Oil prices are crashing drastically, hitting the lowest level in nearly 20 years; West Texas Intermediate fell 24.4 percent now at around $20.37 a barrel.
Today stocks, which have remained volatile, fell again, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing around 1,600 points. This drop follows on from Monday, where the Dow tumbled by approximately 3,000 points and the S&P 500 fell 12 percent. The day has since been cited as one of the worst days in history for U.S. markets.
Nariman Behravesh, the chief economist at IHS Markit, said that a recession was inevitable.
“It’s too late to do anything to stop the recession. All you can do is limit the pain, limit the damage,” Behravesh said.
Today entrepreneur, investor, and Shark Tank billionaire Mark Cuban appeared on MSNBC Live and explained to anchor Stephanie Ruhle what he believes the government needs to be doing in order to support workers and keep businesses afloat during the pandemic.
“The government right now has to open the checkbook and print as much money as it takes. There’s no limit to how much money we will print and we’ll deal with the consequences afterwards because we need the liquidity in the system, we need people [keeping] their jobs,” Cuban remarked.
Cuban then went on to emphasize that those who are staying at home must receive their hourly wages as if they have worked “a full 40 hours,” so they can have a source of income.
“They need to be paid in a pass-through manner because we need to anticipate that the economy will come back at some point, and we want to subsidize and do whatever it takes to keep those business relationships between employer and employer, because if everybody just loses their job, everybody goes on public assistance, and then everybody tries to find a job at the same time, that could extend what would be a recession into a depression, and we need to avoid that at all costs,” he added.

Cuban also told Ruhle that the “smartest thing to do in this quarantine world,” would be “writing checks to every single industry and having those pass through to their employee, whether they’re at home or at work, whatever it is.”
Otherwise, he continued, “people will just lay everybody off, and they’ll feel okay about laying those people off because they know the government will be there to provide a check for them probably every month going forward. We need to try to retain them at their jobs and keep those relationships alive for as long as possible.”

60,"As Coronavirus Spreads, US Economy May Need $4T To Avoid 20 Percent Unemployment",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/as-coronavirus-spreads-us-economy-may-need-as-4t-to-avoid-20-percent-unemployment/,"The coronavirus and the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread worldwide and within the United States, bringing with them economic downturns and woes.
The virus has infected more than 200,000 people and has killed more than 8,000 worldwide. Health departments having reported the biggest spike in COVID-19 deaths earlier this week, the death toll now has surpassed 100, and Donald Trump announced a mutual closing of borders with Canada in an effort to stem the tide of the disease.
Meanwhile, Trump and federal lawmakers all vowed “big” action to rescue the US economy, which could be in for a crash worse than the 2008 meltdown, as governors and mayors have closed restaurants and other businesses which attract crowds of people.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has served as a point person for the economic aspects of the coronavirus crisis for the Trump administration, warned that unemployment could shoot up to a disastrous 20 percent.
“I think that estimate is entirely realistic because if you look at the range of industries that have already been devastated, you can keep on going down the list, hotels, cruise ships, bars, restaurants, movie theaters, personal training, nail salons. It just goes on and on,” said former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, whose $1,000-for-every-American universal basic income has been looked at as a model for a part of any stimulus program.
“So 20 percent unemployment to me is what we need to avoid, and the tough truth is that we need to put money into American’s hands as fast as possible so that families can even feed themselves and weather this storm, but even after this money goes into people’s hands, it’s not going to revive small businesses around the country,” Yang added. “It’s not going to revive all of these restaurants and bars that employ many, many people in every community. This is going to be terrible. It’s going to be less terrible if we plow money into people’s hands as quickly as possible.”
Yang said that he has been working with the Trump administration on the benefits of putting direct cash in the hands of Americans at this time.
“We’ve been talking to the administration just trying to share learnings with what cash does in people’s hands, makes them stronger, healthier, mentally healthier, more trusting, more positive, more productive, and we’re just happy to help in this time of need,” the former presidental hopeful said.
While administration officials have embraced Yang’s ideas, the cash benefits in any stimulus program will be means tested, Mnuchin said.
“I think it is clear, we don’t need to send people who make a million dollars a year, checks,” he said.
Although right now the Trump administration is talking about an economic stimulus of about $1 trillion, Anthony Scaramucci, former financier and one-time White House communications director under Trump, said that eventually much more will be needed.
“I agree with what Andrew is saying, you’ve got to get the cash in people’s hands immediately. I personally think it’s not enough,” Scaramucci said during a segment on CNN. “When I did the calculations today in World War II, Don, we spent 20 percent of the GDP in deficit spending. We are now fighting an invisible virus globally, and we need a $3.2 trillion stimulus. Eight hundred [billion dollars] for the Andrew Yang program. That’s $3,000 per adult, you know, $1,500 for children. This is for people below making $85,000 a year.
“They need a $2 trillion gift and granting or lending program for large and small businesses around the United States, and the large businesses have to commit to no layoffs and no share buybacks, and then the last piece of this is $150 billion going to the nation’s hospitals and to create hospital tents where they’re going to be necessary,” Scaramucci added.
All told, that would be an unprecedented $4 trillion, according to Scaramucci.

61,Dr. Fauci: CDC Testing Failure ‘Not The President’s Fault’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/coronavirus/dr-fauci-cdc-testing-failure-not-the-presidents-fault/,"So far in the United States, around 30,000 coronavirus tests have been conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health laboratories. The United States is drastically behind on testing in contrast to countries across the globe, especially South Korea, despite the fact that both countries found their first cases of the coronavirus on the same day.
According to recent data by the CDC, South Korea has tested more than 270,000 people and has the capacity to test up to 15,000 – 20,000 individuals daily. To put this into perspective, (using the COVID Tracking Project’s data), the United States has conducted approximately 125 tests per million people while South Korea has conducted over 5,200 tests per million. Notably, case numbers are now dropping in South Korea — today only 74 new cases have been reported so far, with the peak previously being at 909 on February 29.
The Trump administration has received scrutiny regarding the testing protocol and the lack of tests being conducted.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said “the administration has no good answers, no plan, there’s no leadership,” and that “members of both parties are frustrated and angry, and they have every right to be.”
Trump has particularly faced criticism for downplaying the severity of the virus and for sharing misinformation. He inaccurately announced that a vaccine would be readily available soon and claimed that the virus fatality rate is a fraction of 1 percent, despite the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating it at 3.4 percent.
Robert Kelly, a professor of international relations, compared the response of South Korean President Moon Jae in with Trump’s and remarked that: “Moon has shown a far greater willingness to take corona seriously and allow experts to run the response. There has been nothing here like Trump’s dithering over the last month, or his bizarre public announcements that this will just go away soon or is under control. Nor has there been anything as unhinged as the conspiracy theorizing so widespread on Trumpist media.”
The administration also chose to develop its own test instead of using the WHO’s test, but this decision consequently led to testing delays. The CDC’s initial design turned out to be faulty, meaning most of the test kits made in early February were unusable.
However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on the Hugh Hewitt Show said that Trump and the CDC are not responsible for the testing failures.

When Fauci was asked “What happened on the testing development?” by host Hugh Hewitt, he remarked that it was simply “a complicated series of multiple things that conflated that just…went the wrong way.”
“One of them was a technical glitch that slowed things down in the beginning. Nobody’s fault. There weren’t any bad guys there, it just happens. And then when we realized, when the CDC realized, and the FDA, that both the system itself as it was set up, which serves certain circumstances very well, was not well-suited to the kind of broad testing that we needed the private sector to get involved in. The regulatory constraints, which under certain circumstances are helpful and protective of the American people, were not suited to the emergence of this particular outbreak.” Fauci explained.
“Was the glitch or anything about the production of the test President Trump’s fault? Or actually, let me put it more broadly: Would every president have run into the same problem?” Hewitt then asked.
“Oh, absolutely. This has nothing to do with anybody’s fault, certainly not the president’s fault,” Fauci stated.
Fauci further went on to emphasize that the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are now working with the private sector, and therefore test kit availability will be improving quickly.

“I believe now that the CDC and the FDA’s department, that we’ve got it right now because we’re handing much of it over to the private sector, the heavy hitter companies that do this for a living. And I think what you’re going to be seeing looking forward is a major, major improvement in the availability of testing,” Fauci noted.
Globally, there are currently around 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and about 7,000 deaths.

62,Trump Still Has His Coronavirus Economic Stimulus Wrong,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trump-still-has-his-coronavirus-economic-stimulus-wrong/,"I don’t understand Donald Trump.
He’s made it clear that the tanking stock markets, the broader economy and their effects on his potential for reelection are more important to him than the human cost in suffering and death from the coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic itself.
However, unlike his fellow Republicans–notably Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Mitt Romney of Utah–Trump remains stubbornly married to a payroll tax holiday as really the only direct-to-the-people form of economic stimulus.
If what Trump is trying to do is merely package another federal goodie give-away to the well-off, disguised as economic stimulus, then that’s what a payroll tax holiday is for.
What it won’t do is either help the broadest number of Americans weather the current crisis, or provide the biggest stimulus to the US economy.
“High-income people don’t spend as much of their income as low-income people do,” said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. “If what you’re trying to do to stabilize the economy is getting people to consume, giving high-income people money won’t help that.”
Meanwhile, Cotton and Romney are each advocating some variation of putting direct cash into the hands of all Americans–something like a version of the universal basic income (UBI) former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has long touted.
“What is the political downside to giving everyone cash? I don’t see it. It’s like, you pass it and you look like a hero; you don’t pass it, you’re a moron,” @AndrewYang tells @AdamHSays https://t.co/6aGBKzoIf8
— The Atlantic (@TheAtlantic) March 16, 2020
A former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama is recommending including a one-time payment of $1,000 to every American adult and $500 for every child in any economic stimulus program.
Jason Furman, now at Harvard University, said that he has spoken to experts and that the virus “that it is not realistic to expect it to go away in two months, and that if it did, it could come back even more virulently again in the flu season next year.”
If Trump’s so concerned with his own reelection, he ought to let go of his ideological rigidity and embrace some of these other ideas actually designed to help the most Americans (read potential voters) as possible.

63,Greatest ‘Impediment to Responsibly Addressing This Crisis’ Is Trump’s ‘Own Ego’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/the-greatest-impediment-to-responsibly-addressing-this-crisis-is-trumps-own-ego/,"As state and local officials across the United States diligently take steps aimed at dealing with the coronavirus and COVID 19 outbreak–and even federal lawmakers and members of his own administration hammer out their own national responses–Donald Trump remains incapable of making any real positive contributions, according to those who are closely watching the White House and the federal response.
State governors and other officials across the country have been closing schools, government offices, even restaurants, bars, movie theaters and other establishments–anywhere that crowds could gather and spread the virus which has now been declared a global pandemic.
The virus has infected more than 180,000 people and has killed more than 7,000 worldwide. In the United States, 3,487 have been sickened, with 68 having died, according to the latest numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trump administration officials, such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have been working with leaders on Capitol Hill to craft legislation to stem the economic fallout from the pandemic.
Trump, himself, has been personally not particularly useful in any of these responses, often only lobbing insults at others.
“Andrea, the greatest impediment to responsibly addressing this health crisis is Donald Trump’s own ego,” David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida and frequent Trump critic, told Andrea Mitchell on her MSNBC program. “He is on a single narrative, and that narrative from the president is, ‘We have it all under control.’ He said that when there was one case in January. He said that when there were 15 cases three weeks ago, then 300 cases, now 3,000 cases.
“He wants the American people to believe we all have it under control, but we know that we simply do not. And if you follow the modeling of other countries, as you’ve reported on, as Dr. [Anthony] Fauci [a member of the federal coronavirus task force] has mentioned, we clearly are heading towards a policy decision that will involve a full shutdown of any social activity in the United States, including schools and churches, and also possibly a freezing of the financial markets until we get a handle around this.
“…We’re seeing governors in New York and Illinois and Ohio have to make those decisions. Donald Trump has such a fear of failure that he refuses to make the responsible decisions now, and it will risk the health of Americans for the weeks to come,” Jolly said.
Trump has been more focused on saving the stock market and his own chances for reelection than anything related to the danger posed by the virus itself, according to Philip Rucker, the White House bureau chief for the Washington Post.
“The president went through the motions today at that news conference and checked some boxes and said some of the things people want to hear, but that does not mean that the problems internally are fixed. In fact, our reporting shows that he has been fixated throughout this crisis on two things, his self-image and the stock markets,” he said. “Why the stock markets? Because he sees that as a barometer for his chances of re-election. He is fixated on himself. Vice President Pence is leading the task force. Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, in recent days has really taken control of some aspects of this but he has zero experience in managing the vast federal bureaucracy and he has zero expertise in infectious diseases.”

64,De Blasio Compares Coronavirus Outbreak to War: Divert Military to COVID-19,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/coronavirus/blasio-compares-coronavirus-outbreak-to-war-divert-military-to-covid-19/,"Today on MSNBC’s Morning Joe program, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) criticized the U.S. federal government for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
He emphasized that the current situation was like a war, and therefore the government needed to “put on a war footing” and take more drastic action. He called for “emergency ICUs in hospitals not only all over New York City” but “all over America,” the “supply chain nationalized in some form,” and a “broader testing approach.” He added that the United States military also needed to “come in with their substantial logistical and medical capacity.”

De Blasio further remarked that there should be a “24/7 production cycle” on health-related products such as ventilators, surgical masks, and hand sanitizers. “Whatever factories, anywhere, can make them, should be cranking them out,” he said. “They should be distributed for federal priority, as you would in a war.”
Notably, there are worries that hospitals will not be able to cope with the strain. In a study conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, it was revealed that the United States only has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people, compared to countries like South Korea and Germany, which have over 7 beds per 1,000.
De Blasio also stressed that the government needed to ensure health care workers safety:
“The thing we have to make sure is that our health care workers are safe so that they can take care of everyone else, obviously, and we’re going to lose — look, some health care workers will be infected. We have to quickly make sure they’re treated so they can come back to action.”
He warned that if these measures aren’t taken by the federal government soon, “you’re going to be losing thousands and thousands of lives that could have been saved.”

During the show, de Blasio then went on to blast Donald Trump for still keeping the military “engaged in building the border walls.” He demanded that Trump “take them off that and put them on coronavirus,” as “anything that is optional right now should be canceled and there should be a full national mobilization to protect people.”
Last Tuesday, Trump tweeted that “we need the Wall more than ever,” suggesting that the border wall will help contain the spread of the virus, and at a recent South Carolina rally, he said the coronavirus outbreak is proof that “the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and wellbeing of all Americans.”
However, it is questionable if the border wall will truly have any impact in preventing the spread; the number of confirmed cases in Mexico — around 50 — is a lot smaller compared to the United States, which has at least 3,500.
Globally, there are now over 170,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and approximately 6,500 fatalities.

65,WaPo Blogger Says That More Republicans Will Die of Coronavirus Than Democrats,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/wapo-blogger-says-that-more-republicans-will-die-of-coronavirus-than-democrats/,"It’s Donald Trump’s older supporters who are most at risk of falling ill, and potentially dying, of the COVID 19 disease caused by the coronavirus, according to a prominent Washington Post blogger.
The virus has infected more than 169,000 people and has killed more than 6,500 worldwide. About 3,774 people in the United States have been confirmed to have the virus, though many others cases may be undetected. Of those reported cases, 69 people have died, according to the latest numbers.
Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin said “there is a particular cruelty/irony that it is their core viewers, the Republican older viewers, who are the most at risk.
“And when you think about it, which party immediately canceled all of their rallies? Which party immediately started having their political figures really portray and use their lives as an example? It was the Democrats,” Rubin said on-air during a segment of Joy Reid’s MSNBC program. “So typically there will be less Democrat deaths because there will be less mass gatherings, there will be less opportunities for people to congregate and share this horrible disease. So it is really a very short-sighted strategy.
“But I think now the name of the game is how do they get back on Planet Earth and part of the way that I think that they where doing it is down the memory hole. [Trump supporters now maintain that he] jumped right on this right away because of all this planning that we’re doing so well. Which is head spinning for the rest of us who watched him for weeks saying this is a hoax. But suddenly he has been the most proactive — “
“Like [he was] the toughest on Russia,” Reid interjected, sarcastically.
“Yeah. And so they will contort themselves to get in line” Rubin said of Trump’s supporters.

66,Biden: I Will ‘Pick a Woman To Be My Vice President’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/biden-i-will-pick-a-woman-to-be-my-vice-president/,"Facing off in his first head-to-head debate, candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Joe Biden vowed that, should he become the party’s nominee, he will name a woman as his running mate.
Biden went one-on-one with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), for the first time Sunday evening in a debate held at a studio in Washington DC, after it was originally set for Phoenix, Ariz., but moved out of concern for the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic.
After a historically huge Democratic field of around two dozen contenders looking to take on Donald Trump, that field has been whittled down to two.
Biden vowed to name a female running mate as an overall commitment to American women.
“Number one, I committed that if I’m elected president to have an opportunity to appoint someone to the courts who will be appointing the first black woman of the courts. It’s required they have representation now. It’s long overdue,” the former vice president said. “Secondly, if I’m elected president, my cabinet, my administration will look like the country and I commit that I will, in fact, appoint a woman to be vice president. There are a number of women qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president.
“Number three, I’m the guy that wrote the domestic violence law,” Biden said, referring to the Violence Against Women Act. “I’m the guy that put in the prohibitions that no one who abuses someone else should be able to own a gun. Period. They should not be able to own a gun. I would get the boyfriend exemption amended now. I have gotten it passed that if you are going to stay in a court, you cannot own a gun. No one should be able to own a gun who has abused a woman, period.”

67,"Fox News is ‘Cancer’ and ‘Getting People Killed’ With Coronavirus Coverage, Warns Boehlert",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/fox-news-is-cancer-and-getting-people-killed-with-coronavirus-coverage-warns-boehlert/,"The Fox Business show hosted by Trish Regan will be going on hiatus until further notice after she received scrutiny for saying on the show that concerns about the coronavirus outbreak were “another attempt to impeach the president.” She further stated that the Democrats and liberal media were using the coronavirus to “demonize and destroy” Donald Trump by blaming him for the pandemic, causing “mass-hysteria,” and bringing down the stock market to “stop [the] economy dead in its tracks.”

Fox has faced repeated controversy over how it has handled and conveyed information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak to viewers.
Recently, Fox News host Sean Hannity told his fans to ignore any warnings from the Democrats about the coronavirus, remarking that “since the beginning, all they’ve done is use the virus, politicize the virus to bludgeon President Trump.”
Jerry Falwell Jr., who appeared on Fox and Friends as a guest this week, said it was “just strange to [him] how so many are overreacting” about the virus. Similar to Hannity and Regan, he also accused the Democrats of causing panic and “hype” as “their next attempt to get Trump.”
So far in the United States, more than 3,000 people have contracted the virus with the death toll being at least 60. Globally, the virus has now killed more than 5,000 people and infected around 130,000. The World Health Organization has declared the coronavirus a pandemic and that the virus has a 3.4 percent death rate; much deadlier than seasonal flu.
Political writer Eric Boehlert, during an interview on MSNBC’s AM Joy with host Joy Ann Reid, blasted Fox News, calling it a “cancer on this country.” He particularly criticized Fox for perpetuating a rhetoric that concerns of the virus are overreactions and simply politically motivated against Trump. He argued that this brainwashes viewers into believing that the virus should not be taken seriously.
“The problem is when people watch Fox News, the hardcore viewers, they don’t watch it with an à la carte menu, they don’t pick and choose which topics they think they believe or maybe they are not going to believe. They are all in. They believe everything. Even during a pandemic,” Boehlert said.

Reid suggested that the Fox News disinformation could potentially lead to actual loss of lives, especially as the average age of Fox viewers is 65, meaning they are more vulnerable to the virus. When she asked Boehlert if it was possible that “Fox may want to try to save its own viewers by forcing this narrative to change?” he rejected this possibility.
“Fox News has been getting people killed for years, I mean just look at their crusade against affordable health care and crusade against expanding Medicaid,” Boehlert remarked, adding, “their programming is to vilify, stir hatred and paranoia, and if it’s a pandemic as the backdrop then they are going to do it.”

68,Coronavirus Possibly Spreading to Prisons: ‘Now Would Be the Time to Commute Some Sentences’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/coronavirus-possibly-spreading-to-prisons-now-would-be-the-time-to-commute-some-sentences/,"A Democratic congresswoman is calling on the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to commute the sentences of some federal inmates as part of its response to relieve the potential for the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic to infect prison populations.
The virus has infected more than 145,000 people and has killed more than 5,500 worldwide. More than 3,000 cases have been reported in the United States, with 60 deaths, according to most recent data.
“It has crossed every socio- and political fault line in our country. When we’re talking about our most vulnerable, our low-income residents and those experiencing homelessness and seniors and that we are also including the incarcerated men and women, who are amongst one of the most vulnerable populations and given the crowding and overpopulation in our prisons for a confluence of other reasons we won’t get into in this interview, are an ecosystem in a petri dish for the spreading of this pandemic, which is why I partnered with my colleagues, Rep. [Nydia] Velasquez [D-NY] to use the following power for guidance on how we will contain and mitigate this epidemic behind the wall,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said in an interview with the Rev. Al Sharpton, on his MSNBC program. “Do they have access to testing, has anyone tested positive and what are the quarantine measures? The fact that many of these facilities are already subpar and they do not have access to soap, to alcohol-based hand sanitizers and regular showers, what is the guidance for those incarcerated and for staff? And that the B.O.P. use their full powers, I think now would be the time to commute some sentences, to exact clemency and to take care of our most vulnerable. Ten percent of those incarcerated are over the age of 60 and already have an underlying condition.”
Pressley said she was not pleased with the response by BOP officials to the congressional inquiry.
“And bearing in mind that 95 percent of those incarcerated will be released. This is an imminent public health threat for those currently incarcerated and ultimately will be released. They did respond to the letter, not within the time line that we outlined but their response was woefully inadequate,” she said. “I’m encouraged while they have stopped visits, that phone calls will be free, but these are the sorts of basic things that should have been happening anyway, which is why I did introduce the people’s justice resolution, a radical reimagining of our criminal justice system that centers the humanity and dignity. Be de-privatizing phone calls, et cetera. And being charged for hand sanitizer they can’t use use themselves is unconscionable.”

69,Dr. Fauci: Coronavirus Is ‘Certainly Going to Get Worse Before It Gets Better’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/dr-fauci-coronavirus-is-certainly-going-to-get-worse-before-it-gets-better/,"The outbreak of the coronavirus COVID 19 has not yet peaked, and national leaders will continue to respond in a way which is “proportionate,” said Dr Anthony Fauci, a leading immunologist and a member of the federal coronavirus task force.
The virus has infected more than 135,000 people and has killed more than 4,900 worldwide. In the United States, there are 1,629 sickened and 41 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“Well, it’s certainly going to get worse before it gets better. And the kinds of mitigation strategies, containment and mitigations that you are talking about, is to do that kind of physical separation of people, which is one of the very effective ways that you can really mitigate the spread of the virus,” Fauci said Friday during a television interview. “If you look at the pattern of viruses, particularly these types of viruses, and even look at what’s gone on in China and in Italy and in South Korea, you go along like this, the way we were, and then you have a big spike that goes way up, and then after a while, after much disease and suffering and death, it comes back down again.
“The purpose of the mitigation is to get that peak and to blunt it so it’s a bit of a hill as opposed to a mountain. We’re at a critical point now, more in some regions of the country than in others, but in general, the kinds of things that are going on will hopefully make that blunting of that peak so that we can save a lot of lives and illness,” he added.
Asked if Americans can expect a “gradual shutdown” of the nation, the way that they have seen other countries respond, Fauci replied, “You know, it’s very difficult to predict, Cecilia. I’m not sure we’re going to get to that. I think that would be really rather dramatic, but I can tell you that all things are on the table. We just have to respond as things evolve over the days and the weeks.”

70,Dr. Fauci Says U.S. May Impose Draconian Lockdowns Over Coronavirus,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/coronavirus/dr-fauci-says-u-s-may-impose-draconian-lockdowns-over-coronavirus/,"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) officially declared a state of emergency in the city in an effort to combat the spread of coronavirus. The move will allow him to enforce more draconian measures if he feels they are needed, such as closing public transit, rationing supplies and imposing curfews.
He said the city, although currently only has 95 confirmed COVID-19 cases, is predicted to escalate to 1,000 cases by next week, and he suggested the pandemic will impact everyday life for around six months.

The mayor signed the declaration of emergency after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) banned mass gatherings of more than 500 people across the state. Blasio emphasized that “going to this level is not done lightly” but is now necessary to help delay the spread and protect those most vulnerable to the virus. He warned citizens that there will likely be product shortages and many businesses may shut down. He compared the situation to “fighting a war…without enough ammunition.”
The restriction on mass gatherings also means most large attractions and venues will shut, including Broadway theaters which closed yesterday; a major tourist-attracting industry that grossed nearly $2 billion last season.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaking on the Fox News Fox and Friends Friday, noted that “although things are going to get worse before they get better, we will handle it if we pull together as a nation and do the kinds of things that would blunt that effect.”
Even though the city is not currently in lockdown, Dr. Fauci warned that it could be possible as “you never take anything off the table when you’re dealing with protecting the health of the American public.” However, he hopes that “these draconian moves of actually locking down a city” do not happen, and stressed that lockdown is a last resort.
During the talk show, Dr. Fauci also addressed that while current panic and anxiety about the pandemic are likely “out of proportion” to the reality, it is understandable why people are concerned, but “you deal with it by action, not by fear.”

So far in the U.S., there are now approximately 1,700 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with the death toll being at least 40. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that in the worst-case scenario, where mitigation efforts are not taken, between 160 and 214 million U.S. citizens may end up becoming infected, and as many as 200,000 to 1.7 million deaths.
However, with mitigation efforts now occurring around the United States, it is unlikely cases and deaths will reach these high numbers. Dr. James Lawler, a professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, provided his own worst-case scenario prediction recently, estimating that there could be up to 96 million cases and 480,000 deaths.
Democratic presidental hopeful Bernie Sanders also commented that the coronavirus outbreak may see more deaths than World War II.

71,Coronavirus May Cause More Deaths Than U.S. Casualties During WWII,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/coronavirus-may-cause-more-deaths-than-u-s-casualties-during-wwii/,"Speaking about the coronavirus pandemic on CNN, Senator and Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders warned about the potential severity of the pandemic.
According to him, the coronavirus could cause more deaths than what presumably U.S. armed forces experienced during World War II. He also compared the impact of the coronavirus to that of a major war.
“In terms of potential deaths, and in terms of the economic impact on our economy, the crisis, we face from the coronavirus is on a scale of a major war,” he said. “And we must act accordingly. Nobody knows what the number of fatalities may end up being or the number of people who may get ill and we all hope that that number will be as low as possible.

“But we also have to face the truth and that is that the number of casualties may actually be even higher than what the armed forces experienced in World War II,” Sanders added. “In other words, we have a major major crisis and we must act accordingly. Therefore it is an absolute moral imperative that our response as a government, as a society, as a business community, and as individual citizens meet the enormity of this crisis.”
World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history. More than 3 percent of the world population perished as a result of the war. The total number of deaths from the military surpassed 21 million. The United States alone saw almost 408,000 deaths in its armed forces from the war.
In the United States, there are currently 1,215 cases of COVID-19 and more than 125,000 cases worldwide. With the estimated fatality rate of 3.4 percent, the coronavirus would need to infect an estimated 12 million people in the United States to exceed World War II casualties.
Some scientists estimate that 40-70 percent of the world’s population could become infected with COVID-19, so 12 million infected in the United States isn’t actually unlikely, considering the United States has more than 300 million people.
However, it’s important to note that COVID-19’s death rate greatly depends on your age.
Source: Mother Jones
Therefore, when we calculated individual death rates for each age group based on 2018 U.S. population data, we found that, if everyone in the United States got the coronavirus, approximately 6.8 million people could die.
If 40 percent of the U.S. population got the coronavirus, 2.72 million people could die, compared to 4.76 million if 70 percent got it.
That’s a marked improvement over the estimated 11 million people that could die if everyone got infected in the United States, which was just computed by multiplying population by death rate.

If Sanders was referring to the global death count, the estimated fatalities with a death rate of 3.4 percent would be 264 million people, if everyone got infected. With the lower, 40 percent infection estimate, around 105 million people would die. This would indeed exceed World War II deaths, which was at around 75 million.
Bernie Sanders could be correct — the number may get much, much worse.

72,"Democrats and Republicans Politicize Coronavirus, but Both Sides Are Not Equal",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/democrats-and-republicans-politicize-coronavirus-but-both-sides-are-not-equal/,"It’s certainly true that you could say that Democrats and Republicans both have been using the coronavirus covid 19 outbreak for political purposes.
There the comparison ends, however.
The ends of each political party in politicizing the disease outbreak couldn’t be more different.
Democrats and their allies have been trying to use a health crisis as an opportunity to advocate for more access.
As Wendell Potter, a health insurance industry whistleblower and author says, this outbreak could be an opportunity for Americans to finally come up with a universal healthcare system.
“Well, I think this is an opportunity for us to come to grips with the fact that we absolutely have to transform our health care system,” Potter said. “Taiwan is a country that’s right next to China, they have universal health care, and a system sort of like what Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have been advocating, and they’re in much better shape than we are, right next to China, when it comes to dealing with this virus.
“We over many years have been allowing the insurance industry to build a wall between us and the care we need brick by brick. And we’re in a situation in which not only do we have 28 million Americans who don’t have insurance, you have even people who have insurance, more than 50 million, probably 60 or 70 million, who are underinsured,” Potter added.
“And those bricks in that wall, by the way, are high deductible plans, which was a scheme by the insurance industry to boost profits, limiting our access to doctors and hospitals, and making doctors beg for approval to get coverage to treat us,” Potter said. “This has been keeping us from getting the care that we need. And people even with insurance are afraid to go to the doctor because of what they have to pay out of their own pockets.”
And then there’s the Donald Trump and Republican version of coronavirus politicization.
It’s not nearly so high-minded.
They’ve been concertedly identifying the coronavirus as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has, as the “Chinese coronavirus.”
What legitimate public policy objective, or debate, does such labeling accomplish?
Nothing but the sort of racism and xenophobia which has been part of Trump’s and the Republicans’ agenda for several years now.
Bigoted statements which spread misinformation and blame Asians and the Asian American community for #coronavirus make us all less safe. @GOPLeader must delete this tweet and apologize immediately. pic.twitter.com/twzCcVAWDH
— Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) March 10, 2020
Meanwhile, Trump himself has referred to the coronavirus as a “foreign virus,” CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta noted in an on-air segment with host Chris Cuomo.
“That is interesting because I was talking to sources this evening, one of the points that the president wanted to make tonight, wanted to get across to Americans is that this virus did not start here. But that they are dealing with it,” he said. “Now why the president would go as far as to describe it as a foreign virus, that is something we’ll also be asking questions about.
“But it should be pointed out that Stephen Miller, who is an immigration hardliner who advises the president is one of the top domestic policy advisers and speech writer, was a driving force in writing this speech and I think it is going to come across to a lot of Americans as smacking of xenophobia to use that kind of term in this speech, Chris,” Acosta added.
So, sure, you can say that both sides are “playing politics” with the coronavirus covid 19 outbreak.
But don’t dare draw any false equivalencies.
You have have one side using the outbreak, yes, as a jumping off point for a legitimately related public policy discussion.
And you have the other down in the sewer of racism and division where they’ve spent way too much time in last several years.

73,"Pence Dodges Questions, Repeats Trump, Amid COVID-19 ‘Pandemic’ Designation",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/pence-dodges-questions-repeats-trump-amid-covid-19-pandemic-designation/,"The number of U.S. COVID-19 cases has grown rapidly: there are now more than 1,000 people infected and at least 37 deaths. The virus has spread to more than 40 states, with many of the cases in Washington State. The World Health Organization recently declared coronavirus a pandemic, and that the death rate of reported cases is around 3.4 percent, making it more deadly than seasonal flu.
Worldwide, there are approximately 118,000 cases and 4,300 deaths so far.
President Donald Trump Wednesday announced that he was imposing a 30-day travel ban on the 26 European countries that are part of the Schengen Area, starting on Friday at midnight. These countries are: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. The ban excludes countries outside the Schengen zone, such as the U.K. and Ireland.
The restriction will apply to most foreign nationals who have been in the Schengen Area within 14 days prior to traveling to the United States. According to the Department of Homeland Security, “[it] does not apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation.”

In Italy alone, there are more than 15,000 cases and around 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths.
“The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe,” Trump said.
“I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus.”
Vice President Mike Pence, who is currently in charge of handling the COVID-19 outbreak, discussed the coronavirus crisis and the recent travel ban Thursday on the Fox News program Fox and Friends, with hosts Ainsley Earhardt, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade.
During the segment, Pence emphasized that although the majority who contract the virus will fully recover, it is important for all people to take precautions to protect those vulnerable to the virus, such as washing your hands attentively.
“For any American that’s watching today that has a family member, a loved one who is a senior citizen with a serious underlying health condition, this is a very good time to help and to support them to be able to avoid public places, and everyone around them to engage in good hygiene and good practices to protect those that are most vulnerable,” Pence remarked.
Pence also noted that they will continue to give strict recommendations to areas where community spread has occurred.
“We want everybody to practice good common sense. But in those communities where we have community spread, we will continue to give very aggressive recommendations, as we have in California and Washington and New York,” Pence told the hosts, “and we’ll respect the decisions of any business, any sports enterprise that decides to cancel events to put the health of the country first.”

When asked by Earhardt if there were enough tests, Pence made clear that they were working hard to produce more test kits and make more available.
“We are working every single day to clear out any red tape to make tests more and more available. Right now every state lab in America can conduct testing,” Pence said, adding, “One of the things we did that’s most important on testing was the president brought in the leaders of the top commercial laboratories in the country who, as we speak, have already approved a test that is being spun up, it’s being sent out to Market, Quest, LabCorp, the largest commercial laboratories in the country are working very closely with our administration. We’re clearing the red tape out of the way. That’s going to be the way, that in the days ahead we are going to have broad-based testing available all across the country.”
Finally, addressing the recent travel ban, Pence explained that the president made this decision due to the drastically increasing number of cases within Europe.
“The president recognized that the epicenter of coronavirus has shifted from China and South Korea to Europe and that is why he took the unprecedented step,” Pence remarked, “same thing he did with China, to suspend all travel for thirty days from Europe, it’s about preventing the additional flow of the infection from Europe into our country.”

74,"Sanders Looks Forward to Next Debate, But Says Biden Can Beat Trump",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/sanders-looks-forward-to-next-debate-but-says-biden-can-beat-trump/,"Even as his chance for the nomination appears to be slipping away, Bernie Sanders remains unbowed, looking forward to what is expected to be the first head-to-head debate on Sunday, between him and Joe Biden.
However, Sanders also seemed to nod to the reality that Biden now seems likely to win the Democratic presidential nomination, with his appearance Wednesday night on The Tonight Show.
“Today, I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country and you must speak to the issues of concern to them. You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older,” Sanders said Wednesday, after he lost the major primary in Michigan, as well as those in other states.
“While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability. I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said, and I quote, ‘I like what your campaign stands for, but I’m going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump.’ We have heard that statement all over this country. Needless to say, I strongly disagree with that assertion. But that is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe. On Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend, Joe Biden.”
Sanders was a guest of host Jimmy Fallon later Wednesday on NBC’s Tonight Show, where he acknowledged that Biden could win in November.
“Say it is Biden, do you think Biden can beat Trump?” Fallon asked.
“I do. I mean, I think, you know, when you have a president who is a pathological liar. When you have a president who truly, apparently has never read the Constitution of the United States,” Sanders said to audience laughter and applause. “Who thinks he is above the law, who is a racist and a sexist and all of that stuff, I think even Republicans and moderates are going to say, ‘You know what, we can’t have four more years of this guy.’ So do I think Joe can beat him I do between you and me, don’t tell anybody.”
Update: After we went to press, organizers of the Democratic debate in Phoenix, Ariz., Sunday cancelled the planned head-to-head event in Arizona, and will instead hold it at a studio in Washington DC, as a precaution of the coronavirus covid 19 outbreak, according to news reports.

75,Dr. Fauci: COVID-19 Will Definitely Get Worse,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/dr-fauci-covid-19-will-definitely-get-worse/,"The number of U.S. COVID-19 cases has drastically grown, with now more than 1,000 people infected and at least 30 deaths. The World Health Organization recently labelled coronavirus a pandemic and declared that the death rate of reported cases is 3.4 percent, a higher mortality rate compared to the seasonal flu, which usually has a death rate under 1 percent.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, attended a House Oversight Committee hearing on Wednesday regarding the coronavirus. In the hearing, Fauci warned that the worst of the outbreak is yet to occur, and there will soon be an influx of new cases. He explained that this is due to containment efforts failing to stop community spread from happening, causing contact tracing to be more difficult.

“Whenever you have an outbreak that you can start seeing community spread, which means by definition that you don’t know what the index case is, and the way you can approach it is by contact tracing, when you have enough of that, then it becomes a situation where you’re not going to be able to effectively and efficiently contain it,” Fauci remarked. “So I can say we will see more cases and things will get worse than they are right now.”
“How much worse we’ll get will depend on our ability to do two things: to contain the influx of people who are infected coming from the outside and the ability to contain and mitigate within our own country. Bottom line, it’s going to get worse.” Fauci added. 
In an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus in areas where it is rampant, such as Washington State which has around 270 confirmed cases, local and state health officials are closing schools, trying to limit public events, and urging citizens to keep their distance from each other.
Meanwhile, on the other coast, the mayor of the nation’s capital, Washington DC, Muriel Bowser, tweeted Wednesday that the public health department has recommended:
(1/2) DC Health Advisory
DC Health recommends that non-essential mass gatherings, including conferences and conventions, be postponed or cancelled. Mass gatherings are defined as events where 1,000 or more people congregate in a specific location.
— Mayor Muriel Bowser (@MayorBowser) March 11, 2020

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also recommended those who are at higher risk, such as the elderly and individuals who have underlying health issues, to stock up on supplies, keep away from crowded areas and only travel if necessary.
During the hearing, Fauci said that commercial entities are now becoming involved and making test kits, and that he is pushing for more surveillance testing to be done.
“[There are] two aspects of testing. One, a person comes in to a physician and asks for a test because they have symptoms or a circumstance which suggests they may be infected. The other way to do testing is to do surveillance where you go out into the community and not wait for someone to come in and ask for a test, but you actively — proactively get a test. We are pushing for that.” Fauci explained, noting. “The CDC has already started that in six sentinel cities and will expand that in many more cities.”

76,"Payroll Tax Holiday Doesn’t Solve the Problem, What We Need Is Paid Sick Leave",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/payroll-tax-holiday-doesnt-solve-the-problem-what-we-need-is-paid-sick-leave/,"George W Bush deserves the credit that, when confronted with his economic crisis, he was willing to throw away Republican orthodoxy in order to do anything–and everything–it took to save the country.
It’s a lesson that, no surprise, Donald Trump hasn’t learned.
Granted, the economic implication of the spread of the covid 19 coronavirus has not reached the meltdown level of the 2007-2008 crisis–yet. But we don’t want it to, either.
And Trump’s response, simply suggesting a payroll tax holiday, is inadequate.
It doesn’t touch enough Americans to fully do the job.
We need a policy which helps the working class on Main Street, according to California Democratic Congressman John Garamendi.
“A lot of the people are definitely not even working today or are working at a minimum wage. What they do need is paid sick leave. That’s extremely important,” he said. “And also we need to make sure that the small businesses that are not able to really afford a layoff at all and for the down side of this because it is the service economy, where most of those small businesses are, that are actually going to get whacked and they already are, so the small business thing is extremely important.”
Garamendi rightfully pointed out that big business already has gotten the help it needs to get through these times.
“We’re not here to bail out Wall Street. The big corporations got a huge bailout in the 2017 tax cut,” he said. “Right now they should be able to weather this storm.”
Daily Show host Trevor Noah put it another way: despite calls from the federal government for people to work from home, and for “social distancing” in order to try to contain the spread of the virus, there are entire workforces who can’t do that.
Cab drivers, Lyft and Uber drivers, people who work in food delivery and more. There is no working from home for these folks, and U.S. federal law currently does not guarantee sick leave. Fewer than 60 percent of blue-collar workers get paid time off.
Whether Trump and his allies truly care about the health and wellness of these populations isn’t even the point anymore.
Unless they relent, and get onboard with ideas to allow working class Americans stay home, the virus will move along unabated.
And, as we’ve been told, Republicans, Democrats and independents all can be infected equally.

77,Andrew Yang Endorses Joe Biden: The Math Says He Is Our Prohibitive Nominee,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/andrew-yang-endorses-joe-biden-the-math-says-he-is-our-prohibitive-nominee/,"Entrepreneur and former candidate for the presidential nomination Andrew Yang announced his decision Tuesday night to endorse former rival Joe Biden for president.
Yang endorsed Biden the same night as the former vice president swept Michigan and several other primaries, amassing enough delegates to put himself in a position where sole remaining rival Bernie Sanders can’t collect the number of delegates necessary to claim the nomination himself.
Yang, who exited the race in February, ran with the support of a quirky, loyal band known as the “Yang Gang.”
He brought up issues in the race no other Democrats were discussing, including the displacement of workers by automation. He also championed the concept of universal basic income, which he called a Freedom Dividend, or $1,000 per month for each American.
Yang acknowledged that he endorsed Biden despite the fact that he backed Sanders when the Vermont senator made his first run for president four years ago.
“Bernie was an inspiration for me, inspired my run. But the math says Joe is our prohibitive nominee. We need to bring the party together,” Yang said. “We need to start working on defeating Donald Trump in the fall. I’ve had many personal conversations with Joe. I believe he’s the right man for the job to help us not just defeat Donald Trump but govern the country in the years ahead.”

78,Democrat Van Jones Warns at ‘Dangerous’ Moment: Biden Needs To Reach Out to Upset Sanders Supporters,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/democrat-van-jones-warns-at-dangerous-moment-biden-needs-to-reach-out-to-upset-sanders-supporters/,"After former vice president Joe Biden swept another big primary night, this time to have amassed enough delegates for many party leaders to anoint him as the presumptive nominee, a well-known Democrat advised Biden to quickly reach out to the supporters of losing candidate Bernie Sanders.
Biden won the big primary state of Michigan, as well as primaries in several other states, enough to gotten over the top in terms of being able to obtain the nomination this summer at the party convention in Milwaukee.
However, Biden would do well to reach out quickly to the supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who appears to be coming up short in his second run for the nomination.
“I think this is a very dangerous moment in the Democratic Party. You have an insurgency about to be defeated. What do you do with the people you defeat?” asked Van Jones, a longtime Democratic activist who also worked in the Obama administration. “There is the hope of a lot of young people they had a champion. Young people that graduate with a quarter million of debt and a lot of pain and they had a champion. They thought they were gag to be able to surround the divided establishment and move forward. But the establishment united and stopped them.
“Now what do you do? The last time Bernie Sanders got beaten, there was an assumption that people were going to fall in line and vote against Donald Trump. There wasn’t enough concern and care of [Sanders’s] base,” Jones added. “I think there will be a lot of relief on the part of the establishment. But turn to those people [Sanders’s supporters] and say, ‘We want to be your future.’ Don’t do that, you’re going to have a pyrric victory.”
Specifically, Biden should pivot to the general election and reach out to young people in particular, Jones said.
“Joe has done an excellent job of making it seem like he relates to young people in those situations,” he said. “So he or his surrogates have to make that case, very, very quickly that he’ll be their candidate.”

79,Pelosi: America ‘Cannot Withstand’ a Second Trump Administration,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/pelosi-america-cannot-withstand-a-second-trump-administration/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke Monday at the Women Who Empower Summit in Northeastern University about President Donald Trump’s government and the upcoming election. She blasted the Trump administration for their handling of situations such as the coronavirus COVID-19 crisis, and warned that the country could not survive another term under his administration. 
“Just look at his policies and his lack of respect for the office which he holds and what that means for our country,” Pelosi remarked. “And I say to my Republican friends, and I do have them, take back your party. This is not who you are. (…) Our country is a great country,” she continued. “It can withstand one term of the current occupant of the White House. It cannot withstand two.”

Trump has faced criticism for his slow response regarding COVID-19 and has been accused of downplaying its severity. He inaccurately declared that a vaccine would be readily available soon and claimed that the virus death rate is a fraction of 1 percent, despite the World Health Organization (WHO) estimating it at 3.4 percent. 
Trump also recently tweeted that the coronavirus has so far caused less deaths compared to the common flu, and implied it is therefore not a threat that warrants action. 
“So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu,” Trump tweeted, “It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!” 
Currently, the coronavirus has infected over 100,000 people worldwide, and based on the WHO’s estimate, has a higher mortality rate than the seasonal flu.
During the summit, Pelosi told the crowd that the damage the Trump administration has done so far to the country can still be fixed, but only if Americans vote against Trump in the upcoming election to prevent him from remaining in power.
“No, I don’t think the damage is permanent.” Pelosi told the crowd. “I can’t possibly accept any thought that what he has done has permanently scarred our country. We must heal, we must repair. But that requires winning the election.”
Notably, Trump has consistently remarked that the media and Democratic Party are making the virus seem worse than it actually is. He claims that they are doing this in order to influence citizens into thinking his response is misinformed, and gain political advantage in the upcoming election. On Monday, Trump tweeted:
“The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, “The risk is low to the average American.”

80,"Bill Maher’s Right: Clinton Has Been ‘Callous,’ and Worse Toward Lewinsky",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/bill-mahers-right-clinton-has-been-callous-and-worse-toward-lewinsky/,"The thing about late-night host Bill Maher, it seems like half of the time he’s firing off saying useless–or worse, downright offensive–garbage.
But then the other half of the time, he actually makes a lot of sense.
Today is one of the latter.
During a recent broadcast of his HBO political comedy program Real Time, Maher slammed former president Bill Clinton as “callous” for saying his affair with Monica Lewinsky had been to manage his “anxieties.”
And Maher is absolutely right.
Reducing his affair with Lewinsky to essentially stress management is not only callous, but cruel.
Callous and cruel to Lewinsky, of course.
But this has been Clinton’s way ever since the name Monica Lewinsky first surfaced and he wagged his finger at the nation and lied that he didn’t have “sexual relations with that woman.”
Since then–and whenever he’s discussed the matter in the decades since–it’s always been all about him. His words have never left anything to the consideration of Ms. Lewinsky.
Granted, this was an extramarital affair. But did Clinton feel nothing for this young woman, from the blossoming of that affair?
It’s clear that Lewinsky felt something for Clinton.
But, for Clinton, was he merely using this woman?
Using her, for sexual gratification?
And, now, we learn, to manage his neuroses, as well?
If that’s all, Clinton should have snuck a few hookers in the back door of the White House, paid them well for their services, and been done with it.
Because what Clinton led Lewinsky on to was at least the contours of a consensual affair.
No, no one’s saying that Clinton ever promised Lewinsky he’d ever leave Hillary for her.
But, for crying out loud, she’s a human being with feelings. A living woman. She deserves better than to go down in history as little more as a stress management tool.
I have no doubt that, by now, President Clinton has worked out forgiveness over the affair from his wife.
But the absolute shabby and cruel way that he has treated his Monica Lewinsky? It’s time for Clinton to seek forgiveness from the other woman.

81,Sanders: Free Coronavirus Vaccines for Everyone,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/democrats/sanders-free-coronavirus-vaccines-for-everyone/,"The coronavirus, formally named COVID-19, is spreading rapidly with more than 100,000 cases worldwide. Recently, the World Health Organization declared that the death rate of reported cases is approximately 3.4 percent; more fatal than seasonal flu. In the United States, there has been 26 coronavirus-related deaths so far.

Last week, at a hearing on Capitol Hill, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that when the vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, it will not be free, and he cannot guarantee it will be at an affordable price. 
“We would want to ensure that we work to make it affordable,” Azar said, “but we can’t control that price, because we need the private sector to invest. The priority is to get vaccines and therapeutics. Price controls won’t get us there.”
Donald Trump previously announced that a vaccine would be ready in the upcoming months, however, this claim differs from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who estimated that it would take a year minimum for a vaccine to be developed. 
Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic nomination in the presidential election, hosted a public health roundtable talk in Detroit Monday regarding the coronavirus outbreak. During the discussion, Sanders heavily criticized the Trump administration’s recent comments about vaccine cost and affordability. 

“It goes without saying that the United States must work with scientists around the world to aggressively develop a vaccine for the coronavirus,” Sanders told the crowd.
“The Trump administration has suggested, as some of you know, that the vaccine might be too costly for some people to afford. How vulgar, obscene is that idea, that you’re rich, you can get the vaccine, you’re poor, you can’t get the vaccine. You’re going to die, you’re going to live so that the drug companies can make their outrageous profits? Not acceptable to the American people.”
“When that vaccine is developed and it must be developed as quickly as we can working with folks all over the world, obviously it should be made free to every person in this country and, in fact, every person in the world.”
Notably, at a rally in St. Louis, Sanders pledged that if he is elected as president he would ensure every citizen received the vaccine for free.
“Let me tell you, if elected president, everybody in this country will get that vaccine absolutely free,” Sanders said, adding, “Is that a radical statement? I mean that is the most obvious statement that anybody can makes.”
However, there have been concerns regarding Sanders’s proposal of making the vaccine free for all. Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, warned that the lack of profitability would disincentivize pharmaceutical companies from developing the vaccine.

82,Dr. Ben Carson Contradicts His Boss: Coronavirus Outbreak Has Potential To Be Severe,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/dr-ben-carson-contradicts-his-boss-coronavirus-outbreak-has-potential-to-be-severe/,"A loyal member of Donald Trump’s Cabinet, who is also noted as a famed physician, has publicly contradicted his boss about the potential severity of the ongoing coronavirus covid 19 outbreak in the United States.
While Trump has consistently downplayed the severity of the spread of the disease since it first began to spread throughout the United States, Dr. Ben Carson offered a different perspective in an interview on Fox News.
Carson, who became famous as a neurosurgeon for his efforts to separate conjoined twins, was appointed as secretary of housing and urban development by Trump at the start of his administration.
“Well, it certainly has the potential to be severe and that’s one of the reasons that, you know, the [federal coronavirus] task force meets every day. We are in communication with a lot of experts around the country in terms of the best ways to contain this,” Carson said. “Obviously if we don’t use best practices to contain the spread, then we will have a horrendous situation, but we are very cognizant of that. We meet on a daily basis, we evaluate the information and make recommendations based on the evidence.”
Fox News host Maria Bartiromo asked Carson about the potential for 4.8 million hospitalizations associated with coronavirus, 96 million cases overall and 480,000 deaths. 
“Is that possible? Absolutely. Is it likely, probably not. We are obviously going to do everything we can to make sure that we minimize the damage that’s done here and that includes, you know, a little bit of common sense and utilizing information that we know already,” Carson said. “We know, for instance, that people who are elderly have and underlying problems that affect their immune system are much more vulnerable than others, but we also note that the virus can be passed on by people who have little in symptomtology and we need to use that information appropriately and if you go to a place where there’s a lot of people and you have a compromised immune system, maybe you need to rethink that.
“You certainly should rethink getting on a cruise ship, you should think about, you know, taking an airplane trip, a long distance, particularly if you’re compromised in some way,” he added.
US markets were in chaotic freefall Monday as a result of virus fears.

83,A Tale of Two Coronavirus Responses,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/a-tale-of-two-coronavirus-responses/,"As another week begins, the covid 19 coronavirus continues to spread unabated, both worldwide and within the United States.
The virus has infected more than 100,000 people and has killed more than 3,000 around the globe.
Here in the United States, at least 417 have been sickened, at least 21 fatally, according to public health trackers.
Americans are understandably anxious, and are looking for accurate, reliable information and advice as well as steady but honest leadership.
And there are those who are trying their hardest to do just that. But then others are just spouting whatever comes to them at the moment, whether or not the information is reliable or they’re just mouthing partisan attack rhetoric totally divorced from the substance of the outbreak.
Consider Gov. Jay Inslee (D), governor of Washington State and Jenny Durkan, mayor of Seattle, remembering that their region was one of the first areas hard-hit by covid 19 before it began to spread across the rest of the country.
Inslee and Durkan were eager to host Vice President Mike Pence for a serious visit to work on disease response.
They understood that this was a time to do the work and leave politics for another day.
Unfortunately, of course, Donald Trump had other ideas.
Trump Friday called Inslee a “snake,” puncturing the feeling of bipartisanship which had surrounded the vice president’s visit.
“So I told Mike not to be complimentary to the governor, because that governor is a snake, Inslee,” Trump said. “And I said, ‘If you’re nice to him, he will take advantage.’ And I would have said no.”
Inslee responded by a more-serious tweet.
My single focus is and will continue to be the health and well-being of Washingtonians.
It’s important for leaders to speak with one voice. I just wish the president and vice president could get on the same page. https://t.co/VAzB9nkcRX
— Governor Jay Inslee (@GovInslee) March 6, 2020
Separately, Seattle’s Durkan reacted to Trump’s name-calling and reports that Trump adviser Larry Kudlow said on a televised interview that Americans should avoid traveling to Seattle.
“The city of Seattle, King County, Washington State and public health officials are taking thoughtful and precautionary steps to stop the spread of the virus,” Durkan said. “We rely on our federal partners for the steadfast support every American deserves. This administration is name-calling and making inaccurate off-the-cuff comments – it’s simply irresponsible and has serious consequences for our residents and businesses.”
Inslee and Durkan are, of course, absolutely correct. They must be tremendously frustrated to be undertaking a serious and earnest outbreak response only to have all of their good work stepped on by the clown in the other Washington.
Meanwhile, the response which Trump and his team have tried to mount–if you can really call it a proper response–has been marked by false claims, ill-advised off-the-cuff remarks, and downright nasty partisanship.
Considering Trump’s own awful, incompetent attempts at a response–and the fact that he must stomp on the good work of actual, legitimate response activity around the nation–is it any wonder that the stock market has been heading into the drain?
The irony is that after spending so much of his presidency trumpeting the economy and the stock markets, now it’s Trump’s own foolishness with his flailing disease response which appears to be bringing all that down–and if it does–it may well end with his defeat come November.

84,FACT CHECK: Drinking Colloidal Silver Prevents and Treats Coronavirus?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/fact-check-drinking-colloidal-silver-prevents-and-treats-coronavirus/,"False.
Colloidal silver is tiny silver particles in a fluid that purportedly have “health benefits.” As the coronavirus becomes more severe, people have been seeking alternative treatments and prevention tips, like drinking water.

Another commonly spread method is drinking or taking colloidal silver supplements. However, while various studies have been done with various types of silver against various viruses and bacterias, there has also been a wide range of results of its effectiveness.
For example, one study found that “the tested colloidal silver solutions did not show any antimicrobial effect in vitro on the microorganisms” while another found “silver nanoparticles proved to be an antiviral agent against HIV-1.”
Due to the various ranges of conclusions, it’s plausible to assume that silver does possibly have some antiviral/antibacterial effects against certain strains.
However, that doesn’t mean that it will be effective in preventing any virus or bacteria in the human body, much less the coronavirus. This strain of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, has not been tested against silver.

Firstly, almost all studies that were done on the antibacterial and viral effects of silver were done “in vitro,” or in a petri dish. The human body is not a petri dish and there are far more factors at play in the human body. As Quackwatch writes, “the fact that a product inhibits bacteria in a laboratory culture doesn’t mean it is effective (or safe) in the human body. In fact, products that kill bacteria in the laboratory would be more likely to cause argyria because they contain more silver ions that are free to deposit in the user’s skin.”
Furthermore, the National Institute of Health states that “silver has no known function or benefits in the body when taken by mouth” and that there are “no legally marketed prescription or over-the-counter drugs containing colloidal silver that are taken by mouth.”
The NIH also states that taking colloidal silver has several potentially serious side effects, including argyria, the discoloration of the skin, which is usually permanent.
The FDA, the organization in charge of the approval of drugs and treatments for various diseases, including COVID-19, has also sent out warning letters very recently to products that claim to prevent/treat the coronavirus with colloidal silver, stating that they are, “promoted with unapproved claims to prevent, treat, mitigate, or cure COVID-19.”
Even more studies can be found comparing the risk versus benefits of taking colloidal silver, which “emphasize the lack of established effectiveness and potential toxicity of these products.”

For those that are considering taking colloidal silver to prevent the coronavirus, we urge you not to, due to the potential health concerns and lack of proved effectiveness. If you believe you may have COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

85,Don’t Mourn for Amy Klobuchar,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/dont-mourn-for-amy-klobuchar/,"The contest for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination will be remembered for the record-breaking number of strong, intelligent and eminently qualified women who competed within the crowded field to take on Donald Trump.
That a woman isn’t going to make it to the finish line certainly is a reason to give women everywhere at least some pause to remember the female candidates who fell along the way, and wonder, “If, not now, when?”
Certainly, many of the women who ran deserve recognition for their path-breaking, and to mourn, “What could have been?”
However, one woman who deserves less praise than her sisters in the fight would be Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
No, this call out has absolutely nothing to do with her policy positions or her campaigning out on the trail.
Rather, it’s what’s apparently been going on with the senator behind the scenes for some years now.
Klobuchar became known in her run for president for her plucky Midwestern smile, for her “Minnesota nice.”
It seems like that smile will fade, however, when the cameras are turned off, or she walks off stage.
Specifically, Klobuchar’s staff spoke up more than a year ago about a nasty temper that the senator has.
More Than Just Being a Tough Boss
The senator likes to chalk it up as just “being a tough boss,” or a sexist complaint, because somehow a male boss becoming so enraged at the staff would be given a pass.
But as all of this came out, word leaked that the senator threw a binder in anger (apparently among other things).
“I’ve always been taught that your true character shows in how you treat those with less power than you, especially behind closed doors,” a former staffer told BuzzFeed News. “The way Sen. Klobuchar behaves in private with her staff is very different than when she’s in the public eye, and that kind of cruelty shouldn’t be acceptable for anyone.”
If we are going to have zero tolerance for sexual harassment and assault in the workplace–as we should–then we hold equally zero tolerance for rage in the workplace, particularly from an employer directed at an employee.
Throwing anything in a professional setting is never acceptable. It cannot be explained or excused.
Yes, some of Klobuchar’s staff have defended her.
But I’ve heard too much, from too many of her staff members.
Even before Klobuchar dropped out of this year’s campaign, I decided that there was no way that I could vote in good conscience to give her the nomination. It had nothing to do with her politics; it had everything to do with her character.
I found her unprofessionalism and cruelty disqualifying.
If, somehow, she had won the nomination, I would have had to held my nose and voted for her over Donald Trump and hoped that she would get her anger issues under control quickly.
I’m fortunate that I’ll never have to worry about that now.
But as I think back to the women I could thank for their effort in the 2020 election, those would include Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.
But Amy Klobuchar?
I’m quite pleased she won’t be making it to the White House.

87,Gabbard Has No Right Pressuring Rivals To Get Her Into Next Debate,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/gabbard-has-no-right-pressuring-rivals-to-get-her-into-next-debate/,"Certainly give Tulsi Gabbard credit for her nerve.
The congresswoman from Hawaii may be running for the Democratic nomination for president, but you would hardly know it at this point.
She hasn’t qualified for a debate since November and she’s won all of two–no, that’s not a typo–two delegates, of the 1,991 needed to secure the nomination.
Even Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts dropped out, as painful as that was for her, when she found that there was no realistic path to the nomination–and she had 64 delegates.
And now Gabbard is on Twitter demanding that her last two rivals standing–the only two with a realistic chance at the nomination–pressure the Democratic National Committee to allow her onto the next debate stage.
.@JoeBiden @BernieSanders I’m sure you would agree that our Democratic nominee should be a person who will stand up for what is right. So I ask that you have the courage to do that now in the face of the DNC’s effort to keep me from participating in the debates. #LetTulsiDebate
— Tulsi Gabbard ???? (@TulsiGabbard) March 7, 2020
You know, even if Gabbard had no chance left for the nomination, you could justify her continued role in the campaign–and in the debates–as the last woman in the race, and the last person of color.
However, no, in this case, Gabbard still hasn’t earned it.
Why?
There’s her history of working against the LGBT community, for one thing.
For another, there is her nearly unthinkable vote of “present” on Donald Trump’s impeachment.
Her Democratic House colleagues all took the tough votes. Impeachment is one of the most consequential votes any lawmaker can take–up there with going to war. But Gabbard wouldn’t even say yes or no.
In her political cowardice, this military veteran simply chose to basically register her attendance.
Sorry. Not good enough. Not nearly.
And then, finally, there’s the fact that Gabbard has become strangely enamored with appearing on Fox News. You hardly ever see her appear anywhere else, and really, most voters in the Democratic primaries aren’t Fox News viewers.
One has to wonder if this is all one big audition for a spot on that network when this is all over.
Given that as a high probability, neither Joe Biden nor Bernie Sanders need stick out their necks on this one.

88,Hillary’s List of Those She’s Sniping at Keeps Growing,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/hillarys-list-of-those-shes-sniping-at-keeps-growing/,"It seems whenever 2016 Democratic presidential nominee and former first lady Hillary Clinton has been popping up in public lately, it’s only with a bad word to say about somebody.
Most recently, she made a wisecrack at her successor in the East Wing of the White House, First Lady Melania Trump.
Clinton also took another shot at her erstwhile competitor for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)
“I think she should look closer to home,” Clinton told Andy Cohen on his Watch What Happens Live when asked how she feels about the first lady’s anti-cyberbullying initiative, suggesting she should examine her husband’s online behavior.
In December, the president targeted 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg after she won Time magazine “person of the year,” posting on Twitter that the activist must work on her “Anger Management problem.” Despite championing her initiative that promotes internet kindness, Melania Trump remained quiet.
And after gratuitously slamming Sanders in January–by saying in an interview right as he was campaigning for his second bid for the nomination that “Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done”–Hillary just came out again to knock him in an interview Friday on CNN, saying: “As I’ve said many times, I do not think he’s our strongest nominee against Donald Trump.”
A look back at Hillary’s most recent line of venom and criticism goes back at least as far as late last year.
It began with an almost bizarre catfight she began with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who briefly ran a credible (visible?) campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination herself this time, before flaming out.
Clinton, somewhat indirectly, accused Gabbard of being a “Russian asset” in the Russian campaign to interfere in the US presidential election this year, as they did four years ago.
That war of words morphed into an almost Keystone Kops style comedy, in which Gabbard sued Clinton $50 million for her “Russian asset” remarks, but Hillary evaded being served with the lawsuit as Secret Service agents turned away the process servers.

89,AOC Would Vote for Biden If He Won,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/aoc-would-vote-for-biden-if-he-won/,"In the 2020 Democratic presidential primary election results, so far, Joe Biden is in the lead at 649 delegates, while Bernie Sanders is behind at 573. The gap between them widened after Super Tuesday, with Biden winning 10 states including Texas, where he unexpectedly gained the majority, amassing 34.5 percent of votes. Biden also won the majority in Massachusetts, beating former candidate Elizabeth Warren in her home state. 
Sanders was once considered the most likely candidate to win the nomination, but just before Super Tuesday, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden, hoping that their combined votes would give him a majority over Sanders.
Moderate Democrats like Buttigieg and Klobuchar believe that Sanders’s policies are too far-left, and if he became the nominee, it would push Democratic voters to vote for Donald Trump instead.

New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been an avid supporter of Sanders, endorsing him for president and aiding him on the campaign trail. Despite this, in a recent interview with Seth Meyers on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ocasio-Cortez made it clear that she would support whomever became the nominated democratic candidate, whether Biden or Sanders.
Ocasio-Cortez also emphasized that it is crucial for all Democrats to support whomever is nominated, as it is the only way to prevent Donald Trump from being re-elected. 
“I’ve said throughout this entire process that what is so important is that we ultimately unite behind who that Democratic nominee is,” she said. “And I think it’s a two-way street. I’ve been concerned by some folks that say if Bernie’s the nominee, they won’t support him—and the other way around. Right now, November, you know, this is more important than all of us. And we really need to make sure that we defeat Donald Trump at the polls, assuming and knowing, how insane it’s going to get between now and then.”
During the interview, Ocasio-Cortez also commented on Sanders’ disappointing performance on Super Tuesday and suggested the lack of youth turnout was to blame. Youths make a large number of Sanders’ supporters. In January 2020, the Pew Research Center conducted a national survey which discovered that 40 percent of voters under 30 supported Sanders. 

“It is going to be now and in November, I believe, turnout of young people that will have a huge determination in our future as a country,” Ocasio-Cortez remarked. “And this is an enormous responsibility. And we’ve got to really, really turn up or else—you get what you fight for. And you get what you vote for. And I think it’s so incredibly important that we fight for a future that will work for us.”

90,"Don’t Blame Some Conspiracy or ‘Unfairness,’ if Bernie Loses the Nomination",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/dont-blame-some-conspiracy-or-unfairness-if-bernie-loses-the-nomination/,"Here we are again. Last time, it came down to Bernie Sanders vs. Hillary Clinton. This time, it’s Bernie head-to-head with Joe Biden, for the Democratic presidential nomination.
And, despite some early wins, Sanders has found himself suddenly trailing a resurgent Biden in the race for delegates.
Depending on what happens next, there’s even a question of whether Sanders will be able to sufficiently catch up in amassing delegates to have a realistic shot at the nomination.
And with Bernie back in second place, his supporters are beginning to come back with some familiar complaints.
They complain that the Democratic “establishment” never wanted Sanders to win the nomination.
They have also begun crying that Bernie’s the victim of a Democratic National Committee (DNC) conspiracy, as well as general “unfairness.”
I’m willing to entertain that, yes, the Democratic establishment doesn’t particularly want Bernie as the nominee.
What I don’t entertain, because I have seen zero evidence, is some conspiracy like DNC Chairman Tom Perez calling up someone in a back room somewhere, at the DNC headquarters and saying, “Sorry, guys, now’s the time to pull the plug on Bernie’s campaign,” like he can just make that happen.
I say that as someone who voted for Bernie last time. (Disclosure: I’m supporting Joe Biden at this point.)
If Bernie doesn’t win the nomination this year it will not be because of some grand “unfairness of it all,” it will be because of such factors as:
He’s a 78 year old man who had a heart attack who refuses to release further health information (which sounds very much like something Donald Trump would do. Voters are entitled to this information before pulling the lever for someone who could be at the brink of death. We just don’t know.)
And he simply has not sufficiently expanded his base with African American voters, which is a key Democratic bloc.
A Bernie supporter complained to me that Bernie’s support suffered on Super Tuesday at the hands of the candidates who dropped out and swung their support to Biden (ie Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Beto O’Rourke), as well as some vague involvement by former presidents Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama.
First of all, the former candidates specifically did what they did, when they did it, to give Biden as much of a boost as possible. Buttigieg, O’Rourke and Klobuchar were very transparent about their intentions to help Joe Biden.
None of the three were ever under any obligation to help or support Bernie Sanders if they disagree with him. They are completely free to endorse and support Biden if that’s what they believe is right.
And, as for the involvement of Carter and Obama? It’s not clear how they supposedly undermined Sanders.
For one thing, Carter actually endorsed Bernie last time. And it’s not clear how either former president could have engineered anything on a scale large enough to cause Sanders to lose unfairly on Super Tuesday.
If Sanders or his backers want to allege a real conspiracy or some true unfairness, present something concrete. Put forward evidence.
Otherwise, it just sounds like a candidate and his supporters who tried a second time–but once again, may be coming up painfully short.

91,It Will Be His First Big Mistake if the Democratic Nominee Lets Warren Get Away,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/it-will-be-his-first-big-mistake-if-the-democratic-nominee-lets-warren-get-away/,"It may not have been unexpected, but Elizabeth Warren’s withdrawal Thursday from contention as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination still stings.
Whether or not you ever counted yourself among Warren’s supporters, it still should be acknowledged that of the many (and we do mean many) Democrats who sought the nomination this election cycle, Warren set herself apart by the earnest effort that she put into her campaign.
You might not have agreed with each and every one, but there was no denying that Warren put thought into crafting a plan for seemingly every problem facing the nation.
This is not to say Warren was flawless. In particular, she picked a needless fight with Bernie Sanders over he ever claimed that a woman couldn’t be elected president. The whole kerfuffle seemed more “political egos as usual” rather than anything of real importance that matters to average Americans.
Now that Warren is out, the nomination comes down to a head-to-head fight between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
Regardless of which hopeful emerges victorious with the nomination in hand, he would be committing political malpractice if he doesn’t find a prominent place for Warren in his new administration.
If not the VP slot, Warren would have to be given serious consideration for treasury secretary or chief economic adviser to the president.
Also, it was Warren who essentially designed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) from the ground floor in order to protect Americans from predatory financial industry practices, during the Obama administration.
It should come to no one’s surprise that Donald Trump has been swinging a political ax at the CFPB since nearly the day he walked into the Oval Office.
So the next Democratic president could also do Warren a little solid on the side and put the CFPB back together again.

92,Big Coronavirus Medical Bills Become Endorsement for Universal Healthcare,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/big-caronavirus-medical-bills-become-endorsement-for-universal-healthcare/,"Frank Wucinski “found a pile of medical bills” waiting for him and his three-year-old daughter after they were released from government-mandated quarantine at Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar, Calif., according to news reports.
They tested negative for the virus, and when they arrived at Wucinski’s mother’s house after their quarantine, they were met with $3,900 in bills from hospital doctors, radiologists, and an ambulance company.
“I assumed it was all being paid for,” said Wucinski, whose Chinese insurance from the standardized testing company he works for does not offer coverage in the United States. “We didn’t have a choice. When the bills showed up, it was just a pit in my stomach, like, ‘How do I pay for this?'”
Wucinski turned to GoFundMe to help cover the costs of his bills and raised $17,930 on the platform. He said he’d be using the leftover funds to buy US medical insurance.
It’s not clear to what degree Wucinski and his family are a unique case, or represent a broader problem for the coronavirus covid 19 outbreak.
What it does do is demonstrate, in graphic terms, the need for universal health coverage in the United States.
Coronavirus covid 19 is getting the headlines, but there are any number of other diseases, maladies and the like which present legitimate and substantial public health concerns which could–and should–be addressed by universal health coverage.
Our hearts go out to Frank Wucinski out of a sense of compassion and basic fairness. But the fact is that there are many more Frank Wucinskis out there, suffering debilitating medical bills not only from coronavirus, but all of those other maladies which aren’t making it into the news.
The Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, had done an admirable job bringing health coverage to millions of more Americans.
That trend has now, sadly, begun to reverse under Donald Trump and his policies and those of his Republican allies.
In 2018, 27.5 million Americans had no health insurance, an increase from 25.2 million the year before.
It’s time for universal health coverage, for all of the Frank Wucinskis out there. Turning to GoFundMe is not viable healthcare.

93,"FACT CHECK: Coronavirus Not Transmitted By Air, Killed By Sun?",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/fact-check-coronavirus-not-transmitted-by-air-killed-by-sun/,"False.
With every news cycle regarding the coronavirus, more specifically COVID-19 comes rounds of myths and false claims.
Trending on popular Facebook messenger Whatsapp is a new message, purportedly from UNICEF, claiming to provide tips to prevent the virus.
The message reads:

Unicef has issued the followings on COVID 19:
1.Corona virus is large in size where the cell diameter is 400-500 micro and for this reason any mask prevents its entry so there is no need to use pharmacists to trade muzzles;
2. The virus does not settle in the air but is grounded, so it is not transmitted by air;
3. Coronavirus when it falls on a metal surface, it will live 12 hours, so washing hands with soap and water well enough.
4. Corona virus when it falls on the fabric remains 9 hours, so washing clothes or being exposed to the sun for two hours meets the purpose of killing it;
5. The virus lives on the hands for 10 minutes, so putting an alcohol sterilizer in the pocket meets the purpose of prevention;
6. If the virus is exposed to a temperature of 26-27 ° C. it will be killed, as it does not live in hot regions. Also drinking hot water and sun exposure will do the trick;
7. And stay away from ice cream and eating cold is important;
8. Gargle with warm and salt water kills the tonsils’ germs and prevents them from leaking into the lungs; Adherence to these instructions fulfills the purpose of preventing viruses.
*UNICEF*
This message is false and there is no such record of UNICEF issuing such a message. We have reached out to UNICEF for a comment and will update this if they reply.
UNICEF’s current recommendations for preventing COVID-19 are:
Wash your hands frequently using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub 
Cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue, when coughing or sneezing, and throw away the tissue into a closed bin
Avoid close contact with anyone who has cold or flu-like symptoms
Seek medical care early if you or your child has a fever, cough or difficulty breathing

Furthermore, many of the claims in the message are also false or misleading. Here, we break it down.
1. Corona virus is large in size where the cell diameter is 400-500 micro and for this reason, any mask prevents its entry so there is no need to use pharmacists to trade muzzles
The COVID-19 absolutely not large in size and the CDC recommends that those who will be in extended contact with those who have the virus use a N95 mask at minimum. The N95 can filter out 95 percent of particles that have a diameter of 0.3 microns, or micrometers. According to the CDC and other various disease control agencies, normal surgical and face mask are not effective in preventing the virus.
Furthermore, according to the peer-reviewed journal The Lancet, the COVID-19 virus has a viron (single virus) diameter of 50–200 nanometers, or 0.05 to 0.2 microns, not 400-500.
2. The virus does not settle in the air but is grounded, so it is not transmitted by air
This statement is also downright false. Respirators are used for the reason that the virus can be transmitted by air. According to the CDC, the virus can be transmitted by “respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.”

3. Coronavirus when it falls on a metal surface, it will live 12 hours, so washing hands with soap and water well enough.
While studies regarding this are still in progress, a paper published by The Journal of Hospital Infection found that similar coronavirus stands like MERS and SARS can persist on surfaces for up to 9 days, depending on factors like temperature and humidity, with the virus average 4-5 days on various surfaces. Generally, scientists say these statistics can be transferable to the COVID-19, which has similar characteristics.
In case this, this statement is somewhat accurate, though the virus can persist longer. As always, maintaining good hygiene is a must.
4. Corona virus when it falls on the fabric remains 9 hours, so washing clothes or being exposed to the sun for two hours meets the purpose of killing it
As stated above, the lifespan of the COVID=19 virus on inanimate surfaces is still under study and unclear. While increasing the temperature of the object did decrease the viral lifespan, there is no specific evidence or study at this time that says sunlight will kill the virus in two hours. According to an article that cites several Chinese health experts, increased heat does reduce the lifespan of the virus on surfaces, but does not decrease its infectivity.

Therefore, trusting the sunlight will kill the coronavirus is very unreliable and not recommended.
5. The virus lives on the hands for 10 minutes, so putting an alcohol sterilizer in the pocket meets the purpose of prevention
At this point, there is also no conclusive study that states the survival period of the coronavirus on your hands. However, the CDC does say that using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with more than 60% alcohol is effective. However, it’s recommended to wash your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds for best prevention.
6. If the virus is exposed to a temperature of 26-27 ° C. it will be killed, as it does not live in hot regions. Also drinking hot water and sun exposure will do the trick
While higher temperatures do decrease the virus’s survival time, it will not be killed immediately and can persist in hot regions. Drinking hot water and sun exposure has not shown to be effective. Sun exposure and drinking water boosts your vitamin D and immune system respectively, but there is no specific effect of hot water or sun exposure on the coronavirus. A fact check by China Daily found that “sun exposure cannot kill the novel coronavirus.”

7. And stay away from ice cream and eating cold is important
There is also no evidence not eating cold foods will prevent the coronavirus. The Harvard Health Blog called preventing the coronavirus by modifying your diet “useless.”
8. Gargle with warm and salt water kills the tonsils’ germs and prevents them from leaking into the lungs
As we covered in our fact check about drinking water to prevent the coronavirus, Dr. Belk, an internist said that “It’s simply not possible to “wash” all potential viruses entering your mouth or nose into your stomach. Viruses infect people by latching onto, then infecting target cells in our bodies. They do this quickly and effectively. A sip of water, or even a big gulp of water, won’t stop them from doing what they’re naturally programmed to do. “
The coronavirus is a respiratory disease and targets the lungs, not the throat or tonsil. It’s transmitted by inhaling droplets that contain the virus into your lungs. Gargling water won’t affect your lungs and kill the virus.
A similar claim that “advises readers to clean their throat three times per day with betadine, a topical antiseptic, to prevent or minimize risk of the virus entering the lung through the throat” was refuted by Dr. Ashan Pathirana, Sri Lanka’s Health Promotion Bureau Registrar to the AFP.

94,It’s Time for Warren to Leave,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/its-time-for-warren-to-leave/,"Elizabeth Warren faced a brutal defeat this Super Tuesday; she has not won a single primary contest, including her home state of Massachusetts, where she serves as a US senator. 
She currently sits in third place at 60 delegates, dramatically below first place Joe Biden who so far has around 560 and second place Bernie Sanders who has 500. 

Today on Fox and Friends, with hosts Brian Kilmeade, Steve Doocy and Ainsley Earnhardt, former George W. Bush advisor and Fox News contributor Karl Rove discussed the Super Tuesday results and what it would mean in particular for Warren. 
When questioned by the hosts who the loser was this Super Tuesday, Rove firmly stated that Warren was the loser, notably due to her loss of home state Massachusetts and birth state of Oklahoma. “Loser, Elizabeth Warren,” Rove said, explaining “People who know you best don’t like you the most, and she not only lost Massachusetts which she represents, she lost Oklahoma, where she was born.” 
Warren has struggled to gain popularity with voters, especially in the time leading up to the primaries and caucuses. According to the Morning Consult, she is currently one of the top 10 most unpopular senators. 

It seems that voters are uncertain if they can put their trust in her. One incident which has likely deterred voters is when Warren–although previously proposed Medicare for all–a health care plan which would get rid of private health care insurance, later backtracked on this proposal. Instead, she proposed starting with a plan similar to the public option, which after a few years would then transition to Medicare for all. Unlike Medicare which has a criteria for who is eligible, the public option is a new government-run health care insurance concept which allows all individuals the option to purchase it. It does not get rid of private health care insurance but coexists alongside it. This backtracking left voters questioning her intentions and if they could truly trust her, and the situation was made worse when Warren was hesitant discussing the costs in setting up Medicare for all. She said a significantly lower cost than independent estimates.
During the talk show, Rove heavily criticized Warren for still staying in the race and not dropping out, despite her knock-out blow. “I think she’s stubborn enough that she’s going to stay in, but she ought to get out because she’s clearly just embarrassing herself,” he remarked.

95,Super Tuesday: The Democratic Party is Trying to Stop Sanders. Can They?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/super-tuesday-the-democratic-party-is-trying-to-stop-sanders-can-they/,"Today is Super Tuesday, the day when the most states hold caucuses or primaries, with around a third of Democratic voters casting their votes for who they want to be the Democratic party’s nomination for presidency. It is the most important day in the Democratic race, its results typically predictive of who will be the elected nominee.
Super Tuesday will play a crucial role in revealing if Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden will have the majority, with delegates currently split between them; Sanders at 60 delegates while Biden at 54. It was previously thought that Sanders would be the most likely to win, however, at the recent South Carolina primary, Biden amassed a significant 48 percent of votes while Sanders only received 19 percent. Furthermore, just before Super Tuesday, Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, both dropped out of the race and are now endorsing Joe Biden, uniting together in an attempt to prevent Sanders from being elected.

Earlier this morning, journalist and political analyst Juan Williams in an interview on the Fox News program America’s Newsroom with host Sandra Smith, shared his thoughts regarding Super Tuesday, and former Democratic candidates Klobuchar and Buttigieg encouraging voters to support Biden over Sanders. 
Williams noted that before Biden’s unexpected win at the South Carolina primary, it was likely that Super Tuesday would have dealt the knock-out punch to Biden, and given great certainty that Sanders would be the Democratic nominee for president.
However, in light of the new result, Williams remarked: “given what we’ve seen over the last, I would say three to four days, really from Friday of last week to now, we’ve seen a tremendous surge for Joe Biden and obviously the highlight of which was his tremendous victory in South Carolina exceeding expectations in terms of winning by almost 30 points.”
Williams also suggested that the new support for Biden from Buttigieg and Klobuchar not only causes more uncertainty concerning who will gain the majority of delegates this Super Tuesday, but is clearly “the Democratic Party asserting itself.”  

Moderate Democrats like Buttigieg and Klobuchar have been worried that if Sanders became the elected nominee, his socialist policies would deter voters and give Donald Trump certain victory. Even if Sanders was elected as president, some are concerned he would take over the party and make it too far-left.
“The way I think of it is, if 2016, we were doing a rerun you would see the Republican Party assert itself to say let’s come together to stop Donald Trump. They never did. The party as a result blew apart and it is now the party of Trump,” Williams explained. “On the Democratic side I think you hear the phone calls coming from President Obama to a lot of these folks saying this is the time for the party to coalesce behind Joe Biden.” 
Although the former Democratic candidates are backing Biden, during a recent rally in Minnesota, Sanders told supports of Buttigieg and Klobuchar that “the door is open” to join him and to “come on in.”
Despite Sanders welcoming supporters, Williams believes that Buttigieg’s voters will not be supporting Sanders this Super Tuesday. “Buttigieg voters going to Sanders, I don’t think so. I don’t think so,” he remarked.

96,It’s Time for Chris Matthews To Go,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/its-time-for-chris-matthews-to-go/,"Time was that you might have rightly called Chris Matthews the smartest person in the room.
He rose from an officer with the US Capitol Police force to the staffs of several members of Congress, including Sen Ed Muskie.
After a failed run for Congress in his own right, Matthews hired on as speechwriter for the Carter administration and later for House Speaker Thomas “Tip” O’Neill.
He later went to work as a journalist and authored a number of books along the way, including the New York Times bestselling Jack Kennedy: Elusive Hero.
Matthews made the jump to television, where he settled in as a political commentator with his own program, Hardball, which runs evenings on MSNBC.
As the years have gone on, it’s not just that Matthews has become more conservative. (He’s admitted on air to voting for Republican George W Bush in 2000.)
He’s also been in the midst of more than one sexual harassment case in recent years.
And then there was the bizarre and uncalled for comparison of Bernie Sanders’s win in the Nevada caucuses to the fall of France to the Nazis in World War II, for which Matthews later had to apologize.
Late night comedian Seth Meyer turned that meltdown of Matthews into a bit on his TV program.
“He’s like your senile grandpa screaming into the phone on facetime, ‘They banned me from the golf course for not fixing my divots. This is just like 1940, when the Nazi’s,”‘ Meyers mocked.

“Somehow, this isn’t even the most insane thing Matthews has said about Bernie,” Meyers added. “After Bernie’s win in New Hampshire, you might recall Matthews went on another deranged terror that had something to do with communists executing him in Central Park or something. It was so incoherent, his fellow anchor Chris Hayes had to chime in to offer some sense.”
Meyers was playing for laughs, but the sad thing is that Matthews’ work on Hardball has really devolved into predictable schtick in which the 74-year-old Matthews basically plays the part of the cranky old man who barks at his guests, telling them some variation of how he knows how it was really done right in the old days.
He’s really ceased to offer anything that you would call insightful political analysis.
Actually, MSNBC would have a much more valuable and watchable program if they they replaced Chris Matthews with his wife, Kathleen, a longtime local news anchor in Washington DC and more recently, a former chair of the Maryland Democratic Party.
Either way, it’s become painfully clear that Matthews’s best days are behind him. It’s up to the executives at MSNBC to end that pain.
Update: Shortly after publication, Matthews announced his immediate retirement on his Monday broadcast of Hardball.

97,Democrats Should Find a Place for Mayor Pete,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/democrats-should-find-a-place-for-mayor-pete/,"“Mayor Pete” Buttigieg, the one-time mayor of small town South Bend, Ind., to rise to national prominence this last year with his unlikely run for president, finally bowed out of that race Sunday evening.
Initially scheduled to stump in Dallas, Texas, ahead of this week’s big Super Tuesday bonanza of primaries across the country, Buttigieg instead diverted back to South Bend to announce the end of his historic run, as the first out LGBT candidate to collect delegates in a presidential contest.
Whether you are a Democrat who counted yourself among Mayor Pete’s supporters or not, I think that you have to concede both the political skill he must possess for a small city mayor to have sustained a viable and credible run for the nomination for so long and the obvious sense of public service he demonstrates, as well.
In many ways, Mayor Pete captured some echo of the early excitement, enthusiasm and public spirit which propelled Barack Obama in his early years.
Certainly, talk will now turn to potential consideration for either the running mate spot or a Cabinet post for whichever Democrat ultimately becomes the nominee.
And those would certainly be excellent career paths for Buttigieg in order to continue to serve.
But what happens if those paths don’t open up?
How could Mayor Pete serve next?
Unfortunately, going back to City Hall in South Bend isn’t really an option, as the new mayor, James Mueller, is a friend and former employee in Buttigieg’s mayoral administration.
And as I once pointed out in this space, unfortunately Buttigieg doesn’t have many potential options as an out gay Democrat statewide in ruby-red Indiana.
However, there’s more potential in the other Mr. Buttigieg’s home state of Michigan.
Yes, Mayor Pete would have to make the painful choice to leave South Bend, but Chasten Buttigieg’s native Michigan could be more politically receptive.
No one wants to see Mayor Pete give up on the city which made him famous.
But it would be more of a tragedy for Buttigieg to have no further chance for public service.

98,"Taliban Agreement a Historic Path to Peace, Says Pence",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/taliban-agreement-a-historic-path-to-peace-says-pence/,"After nearly 20 years of conflict, the United States and the Taliban have signed a peace agreement which could bring a stop to one of the longest ongoing wars in the world, and could result in American soldiers departing Afghanistan within 14 months. This deal took place after temporary ceasefire between the Trump administration and the Taliban had been upheld.
In the signed deal, the Taliban have agreed to cut associations with extremist groups like al-Qaeda and also to engage in talks with the Afghanistan government. On the other side of the deal, the United States has agreed to slowly withdraw troops.
So far, more than 2,400 US troops have been killed in action, and over 12,000 are still currently in Afghanistan. The conflict with Afghanistan began in 2001 as a response to the September 11, 2001, attacks. 
Today on the CNN program State of the Union, host Jake Tapper questioned Vice President Mike Pence on concerns if the Taliban would truly uphold their agreement, particularly with how the deal, while says they cannot assist al-Qaeda, does not ask them to renounce them. 
“The agreement signed today represents a historic step forward on the path of peace and we remain hopeful that it will hold,” Pence said. “Now that being said, the president said if the Taliban continues to keep their word and we just went through seven days where we saw a dramatic reduction of violence, a violence against American forces in Afghanistan and innocent civilian,  if that continues to hold the presidents made it clear that we are going to be able to reduce forces in the region, it is the first time ever they have been willing to commit publicly to oppose the presence of al-Qaeda in the region, first time they have ever spoken out against the terrorist elements.”

He continued, “President Ghani and the Afghanistan government signed the agreement today, the Taliban signed the agreement, they have made a commitment to oppose the presence of terrorist elements — and terrorist organisations using Afghanistan to launch attacks around the world including against us.”
However, there still remains doubts. Last time peace talks were underway between the US and the Taliban, a Taliban attack occurred in Afghanistan which killed a US soldier.
Even more, cracks are already beginning to show in the deal. While Donald Trump has stated that the Afghan government would release 5,000 Taliban prisoners to enable talks of peace between them and the Taliban, President Ghani has denied this, telling reports in Kabul: “The government of Afghanistan has made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners.”

99,"This Republican Will Vote for Any Democrat, Even a Yellow Dog",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/this-republican-will-vote-for-any-democrat-even-a-yellow-dog/,"It used to be said that many Democratic voters, especially in the South, would choose a “yellow dog” before casting a ballot for a Republican. I suppose that describes me now.
That’s not a small thing to say.
Supporting Democrats goes against my political DNA. Yet after 30 years earning my living in Republican politics and campaigns, a Democratic candidate needs to demonstrate just one thing to win my vote — a pulse.
I realized this last fall watching returns in the Louisiana governor’s race, hoping that Democrat John Bel Edwards would win re-election and deliver a blow squarely to Donald Trump and his support of the GOP challenger. I had the same desire for the gubernatorial election in Kentucky and the battle for control of the Virginia Legislature earlier in November. “Whew! Beshear pulled it out. Cool. Really handed it to Trump and McConnell,” was not the typical reaction of Republican operatives.

It’s not that I’m particularly noble, brave, or woke. But I am unwilling to jettison the ideals that made me a Republican or abjectly debase myself to win elections, cling to power, or appease those who expect fealty to an individual above all else. Very few in the GOP can say the same.
How does that square with voting for Democrats?
They might not think they have, but Republicans have abandoned the ideological underpinnings — fiscal restraint, strength in defense and leadership in foreign affairs and trade, reliance on personal character, and responsibility in social policy and individual behavior — that bolstered four decades of conservative dominance in American governance.
If these past four years have demonstrated anything, it’s that Republicans will accept staggering levels of ineptitude, malfeasance, corruption, and buffoonery, provided the offender belongs to the GOP (or the GOP belongs to the offender).
Rule of law and the restraints of Constitutional boundaries be damned.

It’s the elected Republicans and party leaders who are to blame for Trump’s abuses and beclowning of the presidency. For surely as Trump is responsible for his reprehensible actions, they have willingly embraced and/or enabled all he has done. He couldn’t do it without them. Their ideals are fungible. They are craven and servile. They are also foolish and naive.
You’d think self-preservation, if not a sense of principle, honor, or duty, might motivate them to restrain Trump’s vice and perversion of the office he holds. Yet they’ve illogically ignored that as well, losing staggering numbers of GOP officeholders in elections since 2016. They’re immune to sense. Inoculated against reality. Impervious to facts.
They know better. They were better (maybe not great, but not the husks they are today). They’ve thrown all-in for a vainglorious dotard whose incompetence and ham-fisted greed and dishonesty pose an existential threat to the American system, not merely the Republican Party. The contempt I hold for them is far greater than my loathing of Trump. He never was better.
I have not become a Democrat. I support none of them on significant policy matters. I don’t think they’re more courageous or virtuous, or that federal, state, or local governments would operate better if they were in charge. I think many of them would act as dishonorably and ridiculously partisan and hypocritical as the Republicans have if the shoe were on the other foot. But for now, Democrats do not support Donald Trump, and that makes us temporary allies, issue disagreements notwithstanding.
Our system presents a binary choice: Trump and today’s altered version of Republicans, or the Democrats. So, I will support any Democrat — even a yellow dog — against any Republican who supports Trump. No argument to the contrary matters.
Higher taxes? Don’t care
Drunken sailor spending? Already underway
Appointment of liberal judges? Don’t care
Lax immigration policy? Don’t care
Medicare for all? Don’t care
Gun grabbing? Don’t care
You get the point…Don’t waste your breath.
I still do care about conservative ideals, just not the bastardized form of what passes for conservatism these days. Politics is like nature; It abhors a vacuum. Our system begs for factions on the center-left and center-right who compete in the arena of policy and politics, not whatever the hell we have today. I’m willing to re-engage in that battle eventually, hopefully, to build a new party actually based on American conservatism, once the mutations caused by this faux version are removed from the scene. In the meantime, bring on 2020 — and bring on victory by the Democrats, even the yellow dogs.

100,Who Decides When a Muzzle Is a Muzzle?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/who-decides-when-a-muzzle-is-a-muzzle/,"Criticism that he and his administration were “muzzling” the statements that celebrated federal researcher and immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci were able to make to the public regarding the outbreak of the covid 19 coronavirus in the United States must have finally gotten to Donald Trump.
The head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Fauci is both no ordinary federal bureaucrat and one of the nation’s most knowledgeable and trusted figures for accurate and reliable information on diseases like the coronavirus outbreak.
So it created quite a stir when reports surfaced that the administration is requiring Dr Fauci to seek clearance from the highest levels of the Trump administration before speaking to the public.
The fact is that Dr Fauci works at a level above the need to run to the White House for permission for every interview; he is a recipient of a Presidential Medal of Freedom from George W Bush, for crying out loud.
Dr Fauci cannot have proven devotion to country and duty more than that.
Anyway, almost like a man with a valuable hostage, Donald Trump paraded Dr Fauci in front of the cameras in the White House press briefing room.
And like the good soldier that he’s been for every president–Democrat or Republican–for going on nearly 40 years now, Dr Fauci told the assembled reporters what Trump wanted him to say.
“I have never been muzzled, ever,” Fauci said.
However, Dr Fauci made it clear that, when it came to giving interviews, he was forced to “resubmit for clearance” from the administration.
Which, on the one hand, is absurd. Considering the high levels of inaccuracies in his own coronavirus briefings, Trump and his team would do well to come to Dr Fauci to pre-clear their statements to the public–not the other way around.
On the other hand, the kerfuffle over Dr Fauci’s autonomy of speech really is one of semantics.
Because if he has to “submit for clearance” every time that he needs to speak out in this fast-moving disease outbreak, Dr Fauci is effectively muzzled.
It’s just up to Dr Fauci’s masters within the Trump administration to decide when to remove it.

101,Revisiting What Trump Said About the Coronavirus the Day Before,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/revisiting-what-trump-said-about-the-coronavirus-the-day-before/,"At a recent press conference, President Donald Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence as the coronavirus task force leader and informed Americans that the risk of contracting the virus is still very low. He also added that if an outbreak does occur, they would be fully prepared for it. A few hours after this conference, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first US case suspected of contracting the virus through community spread, where the origin of infection is unknown. 
Trump has since been heavily criticized for his response, particularly over his decision to appoint Pence. In 2015, when Pence was the governor of Indiana, he failed to control Indiana’s HIV outbreak, mainly due to choosing to delay implementing a needle-exchange program. If this program was set up earlier, it would have drastically lowered HIV infection rates.
Trump has also been accused of downplaying the severity of coronavirus and not taking it seriously, the World Health Organization (WHO) warning that coronavirus is rapidly spreading at an alarming rate, with over 85,000 people infected worldwide.
This Friday, before heading to South Carolina for a campaign rally, Trump talked to reporters regarding the negative reactions to his coronavirus response. He argued that disapproval to his response, rather than being based on legitimate claims, is a result of Democrats misleading citizens to gain political advantage: “Some of the Democrats are doing it the way it should be, but some of them are trying to gain political favor by saying a lot of untruths.”

Trump further complained that Democrats are ignoring how he took quick action by suspending flights from China earlier in the month. He claimed that this is clear evidence he takes the situation seriously, is fully prepared, and that Democrats concerns are politically motivated.
“The fact is, I made one decision that was a very important decision, and that was to close our country to a certain area of the world that was relatively heavily infected. And because of that, we’re talking about 15, who seem to be all getting better,” Trump said. “One is questionable. And had that decision not been made, it could be a much different story.”
He explained to reporters, “Some people are giving us credit for that and some people aren’t. But the only ones that aren’t, they don’t mean it, it’s political, it’s politics.”
Trump ended his talk by informing reporters that he was attending the South Carolina rally, and was optimistic about how it would play out: “Speaking of politics, I’m going to South Carolina, I think we’re going to do fantastically there. It will be very interesting to see what happens tomorrow.”
Then, during the rally he came back to saying how his actions had helped stop the spread, as well as refer to the apparent blaming of the coronavirus on him as a “hoax.”
“One of my people came up to me and said, ‘Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.’ That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was not a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But we did something that’s been pretty amazing. We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early. We went early, we could have had a lot more than that. We’re doing great. Our country is doing so great. We are so unified. We are so unified. The Republican party has never ever been unified like it is now.”
Furthermore, Trump called his actions, notably the ban of entry for non-citizens from China, “…the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States,” as well as slamming the Democrats’ request to raise the $2.5 billion package to $8.5 billion.

Addressing the COVID-19 situation Friday, he said that the United States was fully prepared, and also noted that “…so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States. Nobody. And it doesn’t mean we won’t and we are totally prepared. It doesn’t mean we won’t, but think of it. You hear 35 and 40,000 [referrence to the flu deaths per year] people and we’ve lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode.”
CDC confirmed today that one person had died of the coronavirus in Washington this morning. During the press conference, officials, including noted immunologist Dr. Anthony Fauci, continued to press that the risk to public health was low, though they predicted that there would be more cases.
This Thursday, Trump said at the White House that, “It’s [coronavirus] going to disappear. One day it’s like a miracle, it will disappear.”

102,Trump Coronavirus Bungling Part Deux: The Fatal Blow?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-bungling-part-deux-the-fatal-blow/,"We thought that we had pretty exhaustively catalogued Donald Trump’s many screwups as it relates to the federal response to the outbreak of the covid 19 coronavirus in the United States.
But that’s one area where Trump never lets us down: Just when you think he’s screwed up the worst, he finds a way to go further.
Such is the case with the news that The New York Times reported that the Trump administration muzzled Dr Anthony Fauci, ordering him to get clearance for any comments he wants to make to the public.
This policy would be bad enough if Dr Fauci were any run-of-the-mill federal bureaucrat.
Dr Fauci, mind you, isn’t any run-of-the-mill federal bureaucrat.
He’s not only the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, not only a leading immunologist and researcher who has advised US presidents closely for decades. So closely, in fact, that President George W Bush, a Republican, awarded Fauci the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
The truth is, if Trump were a real president and not just play-acting, he would have automatically and without hesitation put Dr Fauci–not Mike Pence–in charge of the federal response to the covid 19 outbreak.
Dr Fauci reportedly had been set to appear on all five Sunday talk shows to discuss covid 19. But the way Trump has played it, Dr Fauci was forced to back out of all of them.
The irony is that Trump is fretting over the crumpling stock market and the potential for uncertainty related to disease to impact his re-election.
If only he put his faith in a grown-up like Tony Fauci instead of treating him like a child or the enemy, perhaps the markets–and the nation–would already be more at ease instead of spiraling downwards.

103,CNN’s Harwood: Pence Mishandled the HIV Epidemic. He Could Also Mishandle the Coronavirus,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/cnn-harwood-pence-mishandled-the-hiv-epidemic-he-could-also-mishandle-the-coronavirus/,"Coronavirus, officially named COVID-19, is a new virus strain originating from Wuhan, China, and is thought to have spread from animals to humans. So far, the virus has spread rapidly to more than 50 countries, infecting approximately 84,000 people and killing around 3,000 worldwide.
On February 27, John Harwood, the CNN White House correspondent, discussed on CNN News his thoughts regarding President Donald Trump’s recent press conference, where Trump spoke about the coronavirus and appointed Vice President Mike Pence as the coronavirus task force leader. 

During the conference, Trump emphasized that they are fully prepared for an outbreak if one occurs and the risk to Americans still remains very low. This announcement came just before confirmation of the first US case suspected of contracting the virus through community spread, where there is no known source of infection. 
Harwood criticized Trump for his overconfidence, warning that he was underestimating the potential spread and how difficult the virus would be to control. “I think what we saw last night at that news conference was the president in front of all of us, we could all see it, struggling to accept the reality of the situation,” Harwood said. “Maybe it is like the flu, maybe it is easier, maybe it is harder,” he continued, “it is not inevitable. Well, that was shown right after the news conference, that we are going to have community spread. We have community spread.” 
Harwood also criticized Trump’s decision, drawing attention to Pence’s previous handling of the Indiana HIV crisis when he was the governor of Indiana.
In 2015, Indiana suffered the worst HIV outbreak the state had ever experienced. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highly recommended that a needle-exchange program be implemented to prevent transmission, but at the time the program was illegal in state law and Pence refused to authorize it. Eventually Pence did finally approve the program, however, if he had acted more quickly, it would have significantly reduced the number of those infected by HIV. “We all remember that as governor of Indiana, [Pence] struggled to cope with a public health crisis on HIV by delaying needle exchanges,” Harwood explained, “that had real consequences in terms of lives lost.”  
Harwood further addressed how the stock markets are drastically plunging after Trump’s response, an evident sign of concerns about his approach to the situation.
The Dow dropped more than 1,000 points — its worst one-day drop of all time. “What you have seen today and last night when Dow futures fell while that press conference was going on is a no confidence vote from financial markets,” Harwood remarked.

104,Trump’s Coronavirus Bungling Could Be His Own Undoing,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trumps-coronavirus-bungling-could-be-his-own-undoing/,"Sometimes we’re reminded why Donald Trump is evil.
And other times we are reminded why he is deeply incompetent.
When it comes to the response that he and his administration have mounted to the covid 19 coronavirus outbreak worldwide, and particularly here in the United States, you could say that it’s been a little bit of both–but really more the latter than the former.
The federal government’s best health professionals came out to brief the American people on the facts and the truth that they need to know about the outbreak of the pandemic here, only for Trump to contradict them, over and over--dishonestly.
Trump said the current number of covid 19 cases in the United States is “going very substantially down, not up.” But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said to expect more cases and has warned that it is highly unlikely that the virus will not spread to some degree within the nation.
The president said that the United States is “rapidly developing a vaccine” for the disease, and “will essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.”
That’s misleading. The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said a vaccine at best won’t be ready for “a year to a year-and-a-half” and won’t be available for the current epidemic.
These are but two examples of the falsehoods coming from Trump and his administration at a time when facts and truth are more important than ever.
And then you have that Trump put Vice President Pence in charge of the federal covid 19 response.
Not only does that choice raise questions due to the questionable way Pence handled an AIDS/HIV in Indiana when he was governor, but the fact that reportedly federal health experts have to pre-clear any statements to the public through him first.
Honestly, it should be the other way around. Pence has no expertise to clear their statements. The only reason he would do for would be for purposes of political spin and public relations–which ought to be the administration’s last consideration at this time.
Moreover, at a time when Trump and his administration ought to be projecting an image of “all hands on deck,” they are doing anything but.
Rather than be hard at work with the coronavirus task force, Pence was busy cavorting with conservatives and giving a speech at the annual CPAC convention outside Washington DC.
Pence still couldn’t be bothered to get to work on this national crisis for which he’s been given primary responsibility. He found time to fly to Florida for a partisan fundraiser.
Between the dishonesty and the resultant confusing statements coming out of the government as a result–and the image that the government’s senior management isn’t prioritizing covid 19 as Job No. 1 given the galavanting off on unrelated, partisan matters–should it be little wonder that the stock market is circling the drain and the economy is on the precipice?
If Trump had been smart, he and his political team would have realized that the coronavirus doesn’t distinguish between Democrats and Republicans, and infects equally.
Therefore, they would have just turned the whole response over to the health experts and moved on to other matters.
But, of course, it’s Trump and he congenitally is incapable of either shutting up or telling the truth.
The irony now is that despite what he says, the outbreak could continue for six months or more.
And if the American people spend these next months worrying about the dual evils of infection and a crashing economy, Trump won’t have anyone to blame but himself.
The truth is that the American people are finding that in a real crisis which can really hurt them, Trump is incapable of providing any real help or leadership.
And they will take that with them into the voting booth come Election Day.

105,Giuliani’s Sad New Bombshell (And This One It Doesn’t Even Involve Trump),https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/giulianis-sad-new-bombshell-and-this-one-it-doesnt-even-involve-trump/,"Today’s sad Rudy Giuliani story will have you asking the question, “Where are the conservatives?”
I mean real conservatives, not these authoritarian posers who call themselves conservative but are anything but.
Anyway, today’s story takes us back from Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Malpractice, attorney for Donald Trump, all the way back to when Giuliani still was “America’s Mayor” in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
The New York Post is reporting that, in his forthcoming memoir about 9/11, Republican former New York governor George Pataki reveals that Giuliani approached him, asking Pataki to cancel the then-upcoming mayoral election, so Giuliani could remain in office.
(You know, the same election which ultimately elected a certain rich businessman mayor of New York. That same rich businessman, a certain Mike Bloomberg, today is spending his millions to run for president.)
According to The Post:
Pataki writes that his “mind raced” as he told himself, “Are you really, right now, after a terror attack on our state, our city, asking me to just cancel the entire election? I am a conservative. We respect the law. For God’s sake, you’re a prosecutor! You know the law.”
The irony is that before this brazen request, Pataki had thought about supporting a change to city law to allow Giuliani to run for a third term. But after this bombshell, all bets were off.
Pataki, to his credit, had the reaction to Giuliani’s cockamamie request any honorable and true conservative would and should.
Pataki didn’t give in to Giuliani’s request, and:
When it became clear that Giuliani wouldn’t get his wish, Pataki writes, he arranged a brief meeting at which he admitted, “George, you are right. I don’t think you should cancel the election.”
The real point here isn’t merely to point out another of Giuliani’s many insanities. Rather, it’s to indicate that when Giuliani sought to transgress the norms of democracy, it took a true conservative like George Pataki to serve as an effective guardrail, and that guardrail was successful.
Where are the principled conservatives like Mr. Pataki who today could serve as effective guardrails against the non-conservative, but authoritarian and hyperpartisan impulses of Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell?

106,South Carolina Democratic Presidential Debate Review,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/south-carolina-democratic-presidential-debate-review/,"With three primaries and caucuses out of the way, and so many important ones left to go, we met our candidates on the debate stage yet again. It was a messy debate last night, with no one respecting time limits and everyone devolving into argument. Because of the disarray, the debate felt very shallow. There definitely needs to be a solution to keep everyone on time and on topic in the future. Maybe use buzzers next time? 
Before I review the candidates’ performances, I’d  also like to encourage everyone to register to vote, if you haven’t done so already. It may be too late to register for the primaries depending on your state, but it’s crucial that voter turnout be high in the general election too– so get on it! With that out of the way, let’s see which candidates had good debate performances leading into Super Tuesday. Ranked from best to worst, here they are:
Elizabeth Warren: This debate was a return to the earlier strong performances expected from Elizabeth Warren. She was on top of her plans, but not boring or forgettable. Warren is a serious candidate that her occasional attacks fit in smoothly with her policy ideas, which she was the only candidate to really explore in detail. We got to hear a good description of her plan for her Secretary of Education, a depth that was missing from the debate as a whole. Warren launched into Michael Bloomberg for his behavior towards female employees, and  as a whole she appeared passionate while Bloomberg came off as dismissive. I’m not usually the biggest fan of aggressive attacks in debates, but Warren almost earned it by sticking to her policy focus. Warren needs to get more support to have a shot at the nomination, so hopefully her debating skills will carry her to a stronger showing on Super Tuesday.
Bernie Sanders: I’ll finally admit it: Bernie Sanders is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. He acted like it on the debate stage, and was able to deflect the many attacks directed at him. The thing is, most of the lines of argument against Bernie have been litigated during the debates so many times, whether it’s Medicare for All or Bernie Sanders’s progressive bent in general. The two new points against him, his divisiveness and his comments about authoritarian socialists weren’t really pushed as hard as I would have expected. Bernie has the perfect defense for his divisiveness (he’s winning and converting new voters), and nobody really pushed hard on his past support of the Cuban and Nicaraguan dictators. I think those could be issues for him in the general election, but he was able to push them aside in the debate. I won’t be voting Bernie in the primary, but I do have to commend his debating once again. 
Pete Buttigieg: I thought Pete Buttigieg did fairly well last night, partially because the focus wasn’t really on him. He cruised, and didn’t make any mistakes. Yes, Buttigieg went after Bernie Sanders, portraying him as a radical revolutionary, but like Warren, his entire performance wasn’t about attacks. He was able to bring in his military experience without pandering, and sounded competent overall. While I found Buttigieg a little boring last night, I wouldn’t say he did a bad job. 
Joe Biden: I honestly am a bit stumped by where to put Joe Biden. His debate had great moments and yet more of the same missteps we’ve all come to expect. I liked his concrete use of the Obama legacy, and his confidence about his impending victory in South Carolina. This Joe Biden was more confident, more aggressive, and demanded speaking time that he doesn’t usually get. At the same time, we had another huge factual error, and more of the tripping over the words that makes Biden seem ancient. Sorry Joe, but 150 million gun deaths would be half of the US population! I know Joe Biden has been making these slips his entire life, but mental mistakes are a bigger deal when you’re 78 and trying to look younger. I’m curious as to whether Biden will actually take South Carolina, and that may change how his debate performance appears in hindsight. 
Amy Klobuchar:  I really hate to say it: this was not the night for Amy Klobuchar.  She said a misconception about her was that she’s boring, and, well, she was kind of boring at the debate. If you’re a candidate people forget about, you have to be less forgettable. Everything that came out of Klobuchar’s mouth during the debate felt like a practiced platitude rather than an exciting speech. I know Klobuchar can do better, and she just flopped. All of her responses made me think “Yeah, yeah, we know, Amy.” Honestly, her performance reminded me a lot of the old Joe Biden debate performances where you were really hoping for energy that just didn’t happen. Part of this was an issue with speaking time, but Klobuchar had plenty of chances. I think the issue is that a unity message falls flat on a debate stage where everyone is arguing and a practicality message falls flat in a debate that doesn’t dive deep into policy. I hope Amy Klobuchar stays in the race, but I wish she had given herself a better debate showing before so many primaries. 
Michael Bloomberg: Granted, I didn’t get to see the last debate with Bloomberg’s debut, but it seems like debates are not really his thing. He had some strong attacks on Bernie Sanders, calling him ripe for Russian interference, but he seemed fairly dismissive of the more serious issues leveled against him. WIth every issue put forward to him, be it the complaints from ex-employees, his record on stop-and-frisk, or his tax returns, he had this very flippant attitude that just irritated me. As a candidate who is not participating in the primaries as a traditional candidate and as someone who is only recently a Democrat, Bloomberg’s attitude of “yeah, not a big deal” solidified my impression of him as an elitist. Bloomberg also differed from even the most moderate of the field in a few key ways. His opposition to marijuana legalization and his past donations to a pro-life candidate gave him a Tulsi Gabbard-like feel, that he was abusing the Democratic ticket for his own gain. Michael Bloomberg may be a good businessman, but he’s not a good debater.

Tom Steyer: Someone remind me, why is Tom Steyer still in the race? Nevada didn’t go well for him, and I don’t think South Carolina will either. Steyer doesn’t really have any of his own ideas, and is more of a foil for candidates like Biden or Bloomberg than anything else. Off the top of my head, the only Steyer idea I can think of at the moment is providing reparations, an idea that is a little too close to pandering to South Carolina’s black population. Even the ideas Steyer claims credit for, like climate change and impeaching Trump are fairly popular across all of the candidates. Steyer’s always a counterpunch and never anything by himself. It’s time for him to go.

107,"If Sanders Is Winning, He Needs To Unify His Party",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/if-sanders-is-winning-he-needs-to-unify-his-party/,"Since Bernie Sanders won Saturday’s Nevada caucuses running away, there’s been increasing chatter that he could run away with the whole thing and win the nomination.
That’s scrambled the Democratic Party, reportedly putting much of it into panic mode.
That will do no one any good.
If Sanders is to become the winner and the nominee, it is better for the party to coalesce and unify sooner rather than later, lest give strength to Donald Trump and his re-election campaign.
After we have come to this point, it’s critical to deny a clear criminal and authoritarian such as Trump another four years in the White House.
However, that leaves Sen Sanders with responsibilities towards the party, as well.
Russia reportedly has been interfering to somehow boost the Sanders campaign.
There isn’t even a hint or whiff that Sanders is doing anything to help or encourage this Russian effort.
Still, he ought to repeatedly denounce the effort–over and over and over again. In a case like this, you are better to be accused of over-communicating than under-communicating.
Beyond that, if Sanders wants to be seen as the new leader of the Democratic Party, he needs to start acting like it...now.
That means that Sanders needs to do whatever it takes to unify his party. He needs to actively listen to legitimate concerns other Democrats have and address them honestly and forthrightly.
This includes–maybe most importantly–Democrats on Capitol Hill. This is because a President Sanders is going to have to have the best working relationship possible in order to pass any of the aggressive progressive agenda Sanders has planned.
It takes more than big ideas to be president of the United States–it takes finesse and diplomacy.
Now is the time to see if Bernie Sanders has those within him as well.

108,What’s Right (and What’s Wrong) With The New Calif. UBI Plan,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/whats-right-and-whats-wrong-with-the-new-calif-ubi-plan/,"Entrepreneur and quixotic presidential candidate Andrew Yang may have finally exited the race, but one of his top supporters in California has laid groundwork to very much keep Yang’s signature cause very much alive.
California state Assemblymember Evan Low, who served as a co-chair of Yang’s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, has introduced legislation which would enact a universal basic income (UBI) scheme on the state level which looks very much like the Freedom Dividend which propelled Yang’s race–particularly in its early going.
So the good part of this is that it would implement a plan, in real life, very much on the order of what Yang preached: offering Californians $1,000 per month, paid for with a state value-added tax of 10 percent on goods and services, with exemptions for groceries, medicine, medical supplies, clothing, textbooks and some other items.
I’ve just introduced Assembly Bill 2712- California Universal Basic Income (UBI).. Continuing your work, @AndrewYang . #HumanityFirst #UBI https://t.co/J96GihNilb pic.twitter.com/mJC9bX5Vn5
— Evan Low (@Evan_Low) February 21, 2020
Okay, so we covered what’s great about this new plan.
Now for where it goes terribly wrong.
Recipients of several programs, including the state’s Medicaid plan, would be ineligible.
Here’s where this is bad:
Why are you going to put those who rely upon the safety net off-limits from UBI? It would seem to be one more chance to stigmatize and criminalize the poor. And those relying on the safety net are often the working poor. Don’t they deserve the same consideration? If UBI is to be a give-away to only the middle and upper middle classes, how can we say that we are genuinely addressing income inequality?
Even if the authors of this legislation could point to legitimate reasons to keep those Californians who rely on safety net programs away from this UBI, Medicaid is a particularly lousy example to use. Why? Because post-Obamacare, the Medicaid expansion allows coverage for not only the poor but those who–depending on circumstances–might even be considered lower middle class.
All-in-all, California legislators are taking what is supposed to be a broad help across the economy, and fashioning it as another giveaway to those who may need it the least.
Is this really what Andrew Yang intended?

109,How Many Times Will Bloomberg Have To ‘Ask for Forgiveness’?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/how-many-times-will-bloomberg-have-to-ask-for-forgiveness/,"During the rough-and-tumble of his first appearance in a Democratic presidential debate Wednesday night in Las Vegas, after his rivals for the nomination had piled on over his support for racist “stop-and-frisk” policing while he was mayor of New York, Mike Bloomberg responded, “I’ve sat, I’ve apologized, I’ve asked for forgiveness. But the bottom line is we stopped too many people … “
Bloomberg made it sound as though other Democrats are pummeling him for a single sin, or lapse in judgement–as though, other than stop-and-frisk, he’s been a paragon of progressive ideals, and now everyone just needs to get over it.
Because stop-and-frisk probably won’t be Bloomberg’s only need for forgiveness–rather just the first in what could be a long line of contrition.
The Big Apple billionaire’s sexist attitudes and talk seem like the next of his less-than-progressive sensibilities that he’s going to have to grapple with.
On the stage in Las Vegas, Bloomberg competitor Elizabeth Warren described him as “a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians,” a reference to quotes attributed to him in a booklet written by a former employee, which Bloomberg disputes. 
That he disputes those details obviously doesn’t carry much weight with voters, since when Warren told Bloomberg to release the women with whom he’s entered into non-disclosure agreements as part of legal arrangements, he replied, “We’re not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually,” to boos from the crowd.
Obviously, Bloomberg’s position on those non-disclosure agreements won’t hold water for long, and up he will go with tens of millions of dollars’ worth of glossy advertising to reintroduce Bloomberg as a “friend of women.”
Bloomberg’s need for forgiveness probably won’t end there, as there’s the recently uncovered bigotry toward the LGBT community, specifically transgender women.
A newly uncovered video shows Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg in 2019 describing transgender people as “he, she, or it” and “some guy in a dress” who enters girls locker rooms — perpetuating the worst stereotypes of transgender women.
I can only imagine the onslaught of TV advertising Bloomberg’s people will come up with to respond to that.
No, Mr. Bloomberg, you’ll be asking for forgiveness for a while longer, it seems.

110,"The Green New Deal is Not Enough, says Warren",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-green-new-deal-is-not-enough-says-warren/,"On February 14th Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic candidate currently running for President in the 2020 election, held a town hall event in Virginia to pitch her policies which included her approach to climate change and environmental justice.

On stage, Warren spoke her belief that climate change should be a priority rather than an afterthought: “Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet.” Warren explained, “What truly scares me the most is every single time the scientists go out and collect some more data and do some more analysis, the problem is worse than we thought, and we have less time than we thought.”
Warren further went on to criticize the recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rollbacks by directly addressing Andrew Wheeler, the current head of EPA who enforced these rollbacks: “I have a really creative idea for this.” She remarked, “And that is, how about we get rid of the coal lobbyist who is running the EPA?” Met by cheers and applauds, the crowds’ eruptions were a reminder to how Wheeler has faced controversy since taking up the position. He had previously opposed climate regulations for power plants and encouraged the Energy Department to support coal plants, all actions which seemingly prioritized profit over environmental preservation.    

To protect the environment and combat climate change, Warren claimed that investing into science and research is essential and stated her proposal to do just this: “I am going to increase by tenfold the money we put into science, basic science, applied science, every part of this. We have to innovate out of this problem.” She also promised that with any action she takes, “at the core has to be environmental justice,” explaining, “for decades in this country, this nation has permitted toxic waste dumps, polluting factories, to be located in or next to communities of color.” She said, “It has damaged the health of children who live in those communities.” If elected, Warren promises to contribute $1 trillion to the cause.
Warren also added that while the Green New Deal is a positive approach, it is not enough to combat climate change’s threat alone. She suggested a Blue New Deal to coexist alongside the Green New Deal, which aims to also protect the oceans.

111,Trump Hands Vulnerable Democrats Gift for Re-election,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-hands-vulnerable-democrats-gift-for-re-election/,"If Donald Trump thought he could make easy work of those House Democrats in districts he won four years ago, who took the politically risky–but absolutely correct–vote to impeach him a few months ago, Trump ought to think again.
That’s because, with the federal budget proposal he rolled out earlier this month, Trump hamfistedly handed those vulnerable Democrats the perfect gift with which to be reelected.
When he first ran for president, Trump promised not to cut Social Security “at all,” as well as not to cut either Medicare or Medicaid.
And yet, Trump’s federal spending plan for the 2021 fiscal year would cut $25 billion from Social Security, $241 billion from Medicaid and $845 billion from Medicare.
Relative to their planned cuts to Social Security, Trump officials try to wriggle out of their boss’ campaign promises by saying that the cuts would come from Social Security’s disability benefits, known as SSDI and SSI–not its retirement program.
(Disclosure: This columnist receives SSDI and Medicare benefits.)
The fact that the cuts would come out of the hide of disabled Americans instead of retired ones is a distinction without much of a difference…. and cold comfort to those Americans who rely on those benefits every month.
These are not the “elites.”
These are not the president’s enemies.
These are precisely the kind of Americans that Trump claims to care about.
Which is why, by taking a hatchet to these programs, Trump is actually leaving himself politically vulnerable.
And the Democrats in the red and purple districts aren’t afraid to go on the offensive and use this new political weapon in this year’s campaign.
Democrats like Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, one of the freshmen who came in as part of the wave in the 2018 midterms which flipped the House to Democratic control.
The president’s budget – in addition to slashing Social Security, cutting Medicare, and hindering FEMA’s emergency preparedness efforts – would make deep cuts to the USDA programs that work to expand broadband access for rural Central Virginians. https://t.co/dHpHxyAw7Q
— Rep. Abigail Spanberger (@RepSpanberger) February 11, 2020
“The president’s budget is a reflection of the administration’s priorities—and once again, the administration’s budget plan shows a clear disregard for programs that protect the health of our neighbors, increase opportunity for our kids, and strengthen the overall security of our Central Virginia communities,” Spanberger said. “Among the unnecessary cuts throughout its hundreds of pages, this unrealistic budget blueprint includes senseless cuts to Social Security and Medicare. These popular and effective programs serve as lifelines for thousands of Central Virginia seniors and families who were repeatedly promised these hard-earned benefits throughout their lives—and it’s unacceptable to turn our backs on these promises.”
Republicans have spent months now whining–dishonestly–that all Democrats want to talk about is impeachment; that only the Republicans are the ones talking about the issues which actually matter to the American people.
But now with this wretched budget plan with inhumane cuts to the programs on which millions of Americans rely, Democrats have flipped the script.
Going into this year’s campaign, all Trump has to talk about is impeachment. Democrats will be the ones fighting for funding the programs which are most important for their constituents.

112,"Don’t Do It, Mike: Hillary As VP Is a Lousy Idea",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/dont-do-it-mike-hillary-as-vp-is-a-lousy-idea/,"If there’s any truth to the reports that former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is considering 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton as his running mate this year in his own quest for the presidency, I can only say: Put an end to this train of thought now.
No good can come from it.

Bloomberg would be wise to choose a woman, just not Clinton.
The billionaire would be wise to pick a running mate who is perhaps female, but certainly younger and more progressive than he in order to balance the ticket.
But Hillary?
Trump became president four years ago because Hillary Clinton is the only living American politician about as disliked as he is.
So except for gender, Hillary in no way balances the ticket. And because she is so disliked, she might repel voters–even in the vice presidential slot.
Bloomberg would score more points with voters today if he were to select Elizabeth Warren. Or Pete Buttigieg. He’s not female, but at 38, his youth certainly balances Bloomberg’s age at 78. Also, as a veteran of military service in Afghanistan, Buttigieg would bring that military background with him to the White House.
Even, frankly, he would do better to choose erstwhile presidential candidate and senator from New Jersey, Cory Booker.
An African American himself, Booker would potentially help Bloomberg with minority voters, and Booker talks the progressive talk while fundamentally sharing a similar support of capitalists that hizzoner does.
But Hillary?
Her time has come and gone.

113,"Another Day, Another Impeachable Offense",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/another-day-another-impeachable-offense/,"Well, that didn’t take long.
Not even two weeks after morally blind Senate Republicans acquitted him of trying to withhold needed military aid to Ukraine in exchange for an announcement of an investigation into one of his domestic political opponents, Donald Trump basically tried the same shakedown Friday, this time on the good people of New York.
So much for Republican rationalizing in letting Trump off for the previous crime of which he was so obviously guilty. No, Senator Collins, apparently Trump did not learn that “very big lesson” after all.
In a morning tweet, Trump announced that he would be meeting with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).
But he did so in a threatening way, bringing up another quid pro quo, that New Yorkers might just find themselves on the wrong side of some federal programs unless the good governor does something to make all of those investigations of Trump currently underway in the Empire State just, well, disappear.
I’m seeing Governor Cuomo today at The White House. He must understand that National Security far exceeds politics. New York must stop all of its unnecessary lawsuits & harrassment, start cleaning itself up, and lowering taxes. Build relationships, but don’t bring Fredo!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13, 2020
That, ladies and gentlemen, is a straight-up felony, committed right out in the open and via tweet, plain as day for Trump’s 72.5 million followers (and the rest of us) to see.
Can we say “Impeachment II: The Sequel (Even Better The Second Time)?”
And just to prove what a peach he is, Trump throws an insult at Cuomo’s brother, Chris, by way of an offensive ethnic slur.
Chris Cuomo, the governor’s younger brother, happens to be a prime time host on CNN who regularly challenges Trump and his administration.
While I would very much like to see a full-blown congressional investigation begun over Trump’s tweet, I’ll likely have to content myself with the New York State’s attorney general’s snarky tweet reply to Trump.
When you stop violating the rights and liberties of all New Yorkers, we will stand down.
Until then, we have a duty and responsibility to defend the Constitution and the rule of law.
BTW, I file the lawsuits, not the Governor. https://t.co/tsOLeEgiQp

114,February Democratic Presidential Debate Review,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/february-democratic-presidential-debate-review/,"While we all tried to figure out what actually happened in Iowa, we also got to see all of the candidates debate one last time before the upcoming New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. (For those who don’t know, it’s currently a virtual tie between Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders, but the voting process was a complete mess.) The urgency of New Hampshire made this debate much less boring than I had anticipated, and may have swayed some voters’ minds. Here’s how I think each of the candidates did in the last debate before New Hampshire, including Michael Bloomberg, who was talked about plenty but not at the debate himself:
 Amy Klobuchar
Amy Klobuchar absolutely killed it in this debate. I’ve been pretty pro-Amy for a while now, despite her low chances of actually becoming the nominee. It’s clear to me that debates are Klobuchar’s strong suit, and have allowed her to survive a tough field of challengers. Her fifth place finish in Iowa was closer to Joe Biden’s fourth than anyone expected, and she kept the momentum going during the debate. I loved Klobuchar’s constant reminders of her winning record as a senator and her concrete effort to address racial disparities in voting. Another key moment was her declaration that the debate over Medicare for All was “not real” because the support in Congress was nowhere close to existing. Moderates throughout the debates have been portrayed as the boring ones. Michael Bennet, John Delaney, John Hickenlooper, and even Joe Biden have presented a moderate approach as dull and, well… old, and Amy Klobuchar continued to buck that notion. I guess 59 is the new 38!
Bernie Sanders
Yeah, yeah, I get it. Bernie Sanders is winning, and people like his style. It’s obvious I’m not a fan of Bernie’s uncompromising positions on, well, everything, but he is winning. Bernie Sanders’ appeal lies in his ability to convince progressive voters he’s the real deal, so he’s continued to insist on Medicare for All, on raising the minimum wage, and on taking down the billionaires in debate after debate. I don’t agree with an approach that scapegoats one group of people, but strategically, there’s no reason Bernie should stop doing anything that he’s doing. He also didn’t attack any other candidates, simply because he didn’t have to. Even with Pete Buttigieg tying in Iowa, Bernie Sanders knew he was the current frontrunner. I’d say that Bernie performed well in the debate in the sense that he simply provided the same approach his supporters have loved all along. 
Elizabeth Warren
In a swift change from last debate, Elizabeth Warren is back to being everyone’s friend and to being a unity candidate. She didn’t do well in Iowa, only finishing third, but didn’t do terribly either. I got the sense that Warren was coasting this debate, emphasizing her strengths as a policy wonk and a corruption fighter, but not testing the waters in a way that could change her standing. She wasn’t the frontrunner, so she wasn’t attacked, and she astutely saw that really pushing other candidates could threaten her new unity message. This strategy was also present in her evasion when asked about her capitalism. I’d call this debate neutral for Elizabeth Warren. Neutral may not get her above third place on Tuesday, but I guess we’ll see. 
Pete Buttigieg
The Iowa Caucuses were a huge win for Pete Buttigieg, but I can’t say the same for this past debate. Sure, Buttigieg had a great point about how he was shaped in his youth by other candidates’ mistakes. Mayor Pete was going strong until, inevitably, his race record came up. This has been Pete’s problem since the beginning, and countless commentary (including the comments on my own debate reviews) have touched on it. Pete Buttigieg, for all his efforts, has near zero support from black voters. You would think that after tying for the win in Iowa and knowing about this issue forever, Buttigieg would’ve been prepared for the moderators’ question criticizing his arrest record of African-Americans while mayor. Nope. Buttigieg misled voters by claiming arrests went down and was fact-checked until he gave up the point. Pete Buttigieg may be “discussing systemic racism” as he put it, but his lack of preparedness and action on the issue spelled a bad debate. Buttigieg could’ve used this debate to uplift his support with voters of color, but botched it. In New Hampshire, it may not matter, but in upcoming South Carolina, it will. 
Joe Biden
Yikes. Joe Biden had a hurdle to overcome after his low fourth place finish in Iowa, but if you’ve been reading my past debate reviews, you’d know that debates have not been his forte. Biden hasn’t had a single knockout debate performance since the beginning, and this past debate only continued his streak. Biden’s problem in the debate was that he just sounded old. He slipped over his words multiple times again in unfortunate places, arguing for mandatory prison for drug addicts instead of mandatory treatment. He argued that the past was not really that bad when he was in charge, which made me actually say “ok boomer” out loud to the screen. Even his strong point, his support with voters of color, wasn’t handled well. Biden acted as though black voters were already his by right. I think Biden’s lackluster debate performances were a clue to the eventual fizzling out of his campaign. 
Andrew Yang
Is Andrew Yang even still running for president? He’s a cool guy and all, but every time I see him just seems like I’m at a TED Talk about the Freedom Dividend, rather than a presidential debate. I think Yang knows he’s out and his trying to give his idea some more airtime, and I give him credit for that. I wonder how long Mr. 1,000 dollars-a-month will stay in the race. I figure not much longer after Tuesday. 
Tom Steyer
Ugh, this guy is like Eric Swalwell was right at the beginning: the designated attack dog. Tom Steyer has no experience, no polling support, and really no place at the debate. He just spouts proposals without anything to fall back on, and lashes out at experienced candidates. Take reparations if you want an example. Reparations can work for Steyer because he’s never had to implement a policy in his life. Steyer should work on what he’s good at: taking down Trump from outside the race. 
Michael Bloomberg
Bloomberg wasn’t invited to the debate thanks to the individual donor requirement, but the moderators made sure to remind us he was still in the running. Bloomberg’s absence from the debate gave candidates the chance to each criticize him individually where he couldn’t respond.  This had a weird effect of both helping him by putting his name right in front of voters, but also left him open to any criticism, which Bernie readily offered. Now that the DNC has changed the rules to qualify for a debate, we’ll see after New Hampshire how Bloomberg does when he actually gets a chance to be on stage in-person.

115,"The Trump Supporters Who Aren’t Racist, Are Sadists",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/the-trump-supporters-who-arent-racist-are-sadists/,"There’s certainly enough that you can legitimately criticize Hillary Clinton for, but one thing she nailed right on the head.
She was absolutely right when she called half of Donald Trump’s supporters a “basket of deplorables.”
Actually, strike that. Hillary was wrong there too. But only because she undercounted the number of deplorable Trump supporters.
Today, if you support Trump, you are either or both a racist and a sadist.
At this point, the racism should be prima facie. Certainly Trump’s own. From his response to Charlottesville, to his taunts to non-white Americans to “go back” to where they belong.
And the ubiquitous Trump slogan “Make America Great Again,” now also is more understood as racist and sexist dog whistle, to recall an earlier time (say, the 1950s) in which white males maintained an unquestionable dominance.
That points directly to the underlying racism of Trump’s supporters, nevermind the fact that decent Americans ought to have turned their backs on Trump by now just based on his manifest racism.
And the sadism?
Here, I would like to refer to a brilliant new essay on the idea of “triggering liberals,” published by the endlessly talented Chris O’Leary.
I commend to you the full essay, but let me here just share the pithy wisdom:
Based on my interactions with people who use the word (quick note, using the word “triggered in a conversation with me is usually a very good signal to me that there is no value in continuing the conversation) I believe they think it means one of three things.
First many seem to think it means “annoy the fuck out of.”
Yes. Conservatives who brag about how they “trigger liberals” do indeed annoy the fuck out of me. So maybe those ones have something.
Second many conservatives seem to think it means “frustrate into insensibility”
No. Frustrate? Yes. It’s very frustrating talking to someone who’s only goal is to insult, bother and bore you by parroting insensible PRATT rhetoric from Brietbart [sic], people who listen with no intent to understand, but only waiting to shove another senseless comment down your throat that has no relevance to the conversation or for that matter reality.
To insensibility? No. The fact that people who use words like “triggered” typically don’t listen to what I’m saying with any intent to understand it may make it seem insensible to them, but I can’t help that.
The rest seem to think it makes us cry, and apparently that’s an appropriate goal for governmental policy.
…
To be clear. No. You’re not making liberals cry wasting money on vanity projects at the southern border, killing consumer and environmental protections, running the deficit over the Trillion dollar mark and actively working to make health care harder to get. You’re not making us cry looking for the latest excuse to ignore your dear leader’s latest abuse of power.
You’re pissing us off. We showed you how much in Nov 2018 when 10 million more of us voted than you, and you’ll see how much again this November.
Yes, these are the Trump supporters who actually take pleasure in the hurt and sadness of their fellow Americans… their fellow human beings.
Let that sink in a moment.
Maybe it bears repeating: these are the Trump supporters who actually take pleasure in the hurt and sadness of their fellow Americans… their fellow human beings.
Trump supporters often claim to be good Christians. Where is the Christianity in that?
You say that you are just a conservative, looking for conservative policies for government.
Fair enough.
If that’s true, turn your backs on the evil which you know, yes you know, Trump represents, nominate a mainstream Republican in his place, burn that “Fuck Your Feelings” t-shirt and extend a hand of friendship back to your American neighbors who may disagree with you, but are good Americans nonetheless. And certainly were never your enemy to start with.

116,Virginia Strikes Blow for Racial Healing Without Touching a Single Statue,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/virginia-strikes-blow-for-racial-healing-without-touching-a-single-statue/,"Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and the commonwealth’s lawmakers have taken a big step forward for needed racial healing–and simultaneously making a big statement for all Virginia voters–all while entirely sidestepping the controversy involving the Old Dominion’s Confederate-era statues.
A new law will replace an existing holiday honoring two Confederate generals, and instead will make Election Day a state holiday instead.
Gone will be the annual celebration of Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, two of the most prominent Confederate generals in the US Civil War.
“We need to make Election Day a holiday,” Northam said in his State of the Commonwealth speech last month. “We can do it by ending the Lee-Jackson holiday that Virginia holds … It commemorates a lost cause. It’s time to move on.”
Lee-Jackson Day has been observed on the Friday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The holiday was introduced in 1889 to celebrate Lee’s birthday (January 19) until 1904 when Jackson was added.
In 1984, Virginia’s General Assembly added Martin Luther King Jr., creating Lee-Jackson-King Day, but the controversial nature of the name combination led to the separation of the civil rights icon’s holiday from the two Confederate generals’ in 2000.
Making this change reflects the change in Virginia’s legislature, where Democrats took charge this year for the first time in a generation.
It also reflects the racial healing Northam pledged last year in the wake of the blackface scandal which nearly drove him from office.
Several states and cities have already made Election Day a civic holiday, including Delaware, Hawaii, Kentucky, and New York.
Making Election Day a state holiday enables voters to be off work and get out to vote more easily.
These changes and others increasingly give Virginia the face of a “blue state,” which would have been nearly unthinkable even five to 10 years ago, when Republicans held a decades-long lock on control over the Virginia legislature.

118,"Move Over, Joe Biden. Someone Else Is Basking in the Obama Glow",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/move-over-joe-biden-someone-else-is-basking-in-the-obama-glow/,"If there’s been one constant to former vice president Joe Biden’s bid for the presidency, it’s been how tightly he’s been hugging his relationship with his former boss, President Barack Obama.
Whether it’s been out on the campaign trail or during the monthly Democratic presidential debates, Biden regularly refers back to the days of the “Obama-Biden administration,” just to remind voters as often as he can of his relationship to the popular former president and the years of relative national calm and stability we enjoyed compared to these tumultuous, divisive years under Donald Trump.
Problem is that Biden no longer has the Obama corner to himself. Here comes billionaire and former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg with his free-spending TV advertising juggernaut. Because this time Bloomberg is up with an ad which touts his close relationship with our 44th president, and how Bloomberg has worked with Obama on important issues like gun safety, education and job creation.
The way the ad is cut, you might be forgiven for thinking that Bloomberg, not Biden, was Obama’s loyal VP.
And considering that a) Obama personally has remained silent in offering any endorsement in this year’s Democratic presidential contest and b) Bloomberg spends so freely to air his TV commercials (one report pegs it at more than $100 million thus far), you might be really be forgiven if you thought that after repeatedly viewing these ads, perhaps Obama had actually endorsed Bloomberg.
None of this can be good news for Biden, who started out this race as almost the invincible front-runner, but this week limped out of the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses in a disappointing fourth place.
Biden’s major selling point this year had been that he had been Barack Obama’s right hand man, and that gave him the unique qualification that a vote for him, in essence, was a vote for a third Obama term.
And, now, with a single 30-second ad, Mike Bloomberg has essentially demolished Joe Biden’s basic rationale for his campaign this year.
No, this has not been a good week for Biden at all.

119,"Thank you, Senator Romney",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/thank-you-senator-romney/,"I’m going to write words I never imagined that I would when I first encountered Mitt Romney when he first ran for office, against Sen. Ted Kennedy in Massachusetts, all the way back in 1994.
Thank you, Senator Romney. You have have respected your office, and you have respected the American people and you have respected the nation that you have pledged to serve.
Thank you.
Today a senator from Utah, Romney is the sole Senate Republican to vote to remove Donald Trump from office on the charge of abuse of power.
While his GOP colleagues have tied themselves in knots of illogic in rationalizing why they all are refusing to follow the clear evidence, Romney is showing a bit of the shine of the Republican party of old, and is doing the honorable and patriotic thing.
Romney is putting country ahead of party, and is telling Trump that it’s time to go.
Of course, Romney’s vote alone won’t be enough and, sadly, Trump will end up remaining in office.
Romney’s dishonorable and disingenuous colleagues have repeated, ad nauseum, that the proper venue to decide Trump’s misdeeds is going to be at the ballot box come November.
Well, now I hope that voters use that ballot box to render the same negative decision against Trump and all of those who have protected him.
And we come back to the lone hero, Sen. Romney.
No doubt he will become something of a pariah within his Republican caucus for straying so far from the reservation and actually doing the right thing.
None of this changes the fact that Romney remains a conservative Republican. I probably still disagree with 90 percent of his policies.
But that’s okay. He’s shown us that even people who disagree on politics can still come together when it comes to right and wrong.
I didn’t vote for Romney in that first election of his a quarter century ago. I still probably wouldn’t vote for him if it came to it.
But I would shake his hand, happily, and say a sincere “Thank you.”

120,Mike Pence Has Been Perhaps the Most Irrelevant VP in at Least a Generation,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/mike-pence-has-been-perhaps-the-most-irrelevant-vp-in-at-least-a-generation/,"“The vice-presidency isn’t worth a pitcher of warm piss. It doesn’t amount to a hill of beans.”
–– John Nance Garner, vice president of the United States
FDR’s first vice president, Garner came from an era when, once safely in office, presidents didn’t rely much on their running mates.
Vice presidents really were mostly left to their prescribed constitutional duties, which consist all of, essentially, casting tie-breaking votes in the Senate and standing by to take over should their boss die in office.
That’s it, and you can see for yourself what a man used to power like Garner, a former speaker of the US House, thought of that.
It wouldn’t be for decades until a different, more muscular, vice presidency would begin to emerge.
It’s almost certain that Garner wouldn’t have believed his eyes if he had lived to watch his successors like Al Gore, Dick Cheney and Joe Biden.
But Mike Pence?
Pence seems to be a vice president, oddly, who prefers the warm piss.
You have to go back at least a generation, and perhaps Dan Quayle, before you find a vice president who has been as irrelevant as Mike Pence.
Pence’s recent predecessors had their boss’ ear and had clear influence on the administration in a way Pence just hasn’t.
It’s been clear since Day One that only Donald Trump, and Trump alone, calls the shots.
Trump, by contrast, has made it clear that he’s never been 100 percent happy with his choice of Pence.
He chose Pence largely to win votes from Evangelicals, but Pence has made almost no impression on the administration since. (And Trump probably would have won the Evangelical vote even without Pence.)
Indeed, Pence became a subject of mockery by the late-night comedians back in late 2018 after an Oval Office photo op featuring Trump, Pence, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and then-House Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi on the eve of the federal government shutdown.
The photo op quickly turned into a raucous and disagreeable encounter, with Trump, Schumer and Pelosi all trying to make their points loudly and with various hand gestures.
Except for Mike Pence, who sat there, silently and stone-still, as if he were trying to blend in with the furniture.
The whispers persist that Trump is considering dumping Pence off the ticket for the attempt at re-election, with former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley as a top contender as a replacement.
But the bigger question might be, if Mike Pence, were to go: would anybody miss him once he was gone?

121,"If Dr. Fauci Is Part of the ‘Deep State,’ Thank Goodness for the Deep State",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/if-dr-fauci-is-part-of-the-deep-state-thank-goodness-for-the-deep-state/,"Since it first emerged weeks ago, the deadly coronavirus has sickened nearly 10,000 people in China and killed about 200.
Meanwhile, here in the United States, so far just a handful of Americans have been stricken while the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has imposed a quarantine on nearly 200 who have traveled from the epicenter of the disease outbreak in China.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, a celebrated immunologist who heads up the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has taken a prominent role in heading up the American response.
Americans should rest easier knowing that a top scientist like Dr. Fauci is taking point on such an important crisis.
Among his accomplishments, Fauci played a significant role in the early 2000s in creating the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and in driving development of biodefense drugs and vaccines following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Clearly, Dr Fauci is one of the top minds in his field.
And working at the National Institutes of Health for more than a half-century, he’s worked closely with political appointees and administrations of both parties.

So I suppose, then, that Dr Fauci could easily be tagged as a member of that conspiracy theory, fever dream creation of Donald Trump supporters everywhere: the so-called US “deep state.”
Except that he’s not. Dr. Fauci has performed at a level of excellence regardless of who has happened to occupy the Oval Office.
And Fauci certainly is not unique. Just because they aren’t necessarily well known like Fauci, the millions of other professionals in the federal workforce are just as professional and personally invested in carrying out their duties.
I’ll say for the record here that I have a personal perspective here, having been part of that workforce twice: once as an employee and once as a contractor, and once each under a Democratic and Republican president.
And it made no difference to me or my colleagues whose presidential photo happened to be hanging in the lobby.
Indeed, the federal workforce has seen many Republican presidents come and go. Not one of them before suggested that their workforce was somehow working against them.
Rather than obsess over absurd conspiracy theories, Americans should be proud of a federal workforce which shows up every day to perform cutting-edge research, investigate accidents, care for our national parks, and administer any number of federal programs which make a positive difference for millions of your fellow American citizens.

But if you insist on calling these clearly devoted, professional folks the “deep state,” then thank goodness for the deep state.

122,"Trump is Risking Our Elections, says Schumer",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-is-risking-our-elections-says-schumer/,"Donald Trump and his lawyers have urged for Hunter Biden – former vice president Joe Biden’s son – to be questioned in the impeachment trial, arguing the Bidens participated in corrupt activities while working for the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. 
On January 28th a press conference regarding Trump’s impeachment trial was held by Sen. Chuck Schumer and other Democratic senators. During the conference, Schumer expressed to reporters that despite Trump’s insistence for Hunter Biden to be questioned, he is irrelevant to the trial. Rather, Schumer suggested that this move is not only to tarnish the integrity of the Bidens, but an “intentional misdirection, a distraction” from John Bolton’s allegations, the former national security advisor, who disclosed that Trump would only provide military aid to Ukraine if they gave information about his opposition in return.

“Hunter Biden has nothing to do with the facts of this trial.” Schumer explained, “President Trump is so obsessed with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden that he’s willing to risk our elections and our national security to go after him. And now the President and his lawyers are willing to risk the solemnity and purpose of an impeachment trial to go after him.”
“The fact that the President and some Republicans are proposing Hunter Biden as one of their witnesses,” Schumer summarised, “just goes to show they have no one to defend the President on the merits, plain and simple.” 
Schumer further went on to criticise Jay Sekulow, a member of Trump’s defense team, for spreading misinformation after Sekulow stated that one of their arguments to prove Trump’s innocence is that there were no eyewitnesses to Trump’s actions who have testified.
He remarks, “[Sekulow] has the nerve and the gall to get up there and say that there are no eyewitness testimony when we know that John Bolton has eyewitness testimony, and is willing to testify.” 

Schumer also addressed the importance and need for witnesses like John Bolton to speak in the impeachment trial. “The bottom line remains,” he explains, “It is on the shoulders of four Republican senators to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of the President’s actions testify in a Senate trial.”

123,"If Yang Meets Oprah, What Then?",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/if-yang-meets-oprah-what-then/,"Have we become so Pavlovian that just because something begins to trend on social media, that that means it’s necessarily good or important?
The latest example of this is the hashtag “oprahmeetyang,” which encourages a meeting between Democratic presidential candidate and entrepreneur Andrew Yang and media maven and former talk show queen Oprah Winfrey.
Yang’s supporters are pushing for the meeting hard on Twitter.
#OprahMeetYang yes. I imagine a talk between you two would be great
— K (@krizz3n) January 30, 2020
Okay, say Yang and Oprah have this supposedly collosal encounter. Then what?
Presumably, Oprah’s supposed to come out and endorse Yang? Here’s the thing, Oprah famously endorsed Barack Obama back in 2008. It was a case of an African American superstar, Oprah, pushing for the election of the nation’s first African American president.
Yes, Yang is Asian American. But Winfrey’s certainly not. So it would amount to just another celebrity endorsement.
Not to mention that since that historic election, Winfrey retired from daytime TV, and has given up her talk show which to use as her soapbox.
Or what? Offer her the slot as his running mate?
For one thing, Winfrey’s already signalled her disinterest in getting into presidential politics.
For another, Yang already himself is unelected and inexperienced in government. If he wants to be taken seriously, he would need a running mate more experienced in federal affairs, not a second newbie.
And you know who else expressed interest in Oprah Winfrey as a running mate? Donald Trump.
That’s right.
Trump talked up Oprah as a potential running mate when he flirted with running for president back in 1999.
If I were Andrew Yang, I would leave that one alone.
If Yang truly wants to become the Democratic nominee, he absolutely should be taking lots of meetings. But with folks who can do a lot more for his candidacy than Oprah Winfrey.

124,Sanders’ Potential Executive Orders Would Be a Window Into His Presidency,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/sanders-potential-executive-orders-would-be-a-window-into-his-presidency/,"The Washington Post Thursday revealed that Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign has been preparing a list of executive orders which Sanders could unilaterally enact if elected president, in the areas of immigration, the environment and prescription drugs.
So far, the existence of the Sanders executive orders proposals lives only in an internal campaign document, according to the Post story.
That should change.
Sanders ought to release drafts of these planned executive orders to the public, with the proviso that they are not finalized.
Still, however, making them public would give voters an important window into what a Sanders presidency could well look like.
It would be easy enough to post those drafts on the Sanders for president website. Indeed, it would be also a great way to drive new traffic to the site and solicit additional financial contributions at a time when Sanders is rising in the polls.
Public opinion polling shows that Sanders is rising sharply in the early voting states, including Iowa, the site of caucuses next week.
“I love your ideas, Bernie,” a woman told him at a town hall event in Anamosa, Iowa, earlier in January. “But what are you going to do about the partisanship that prevents any good Democrat from getting anywhere in Congress right now?”
Sanders replied, “We’re going to run a different type of presidency.”
The executive orders probably are a big part of that different type of presidency, although the Vermont independent also is pushing several big initiatives, such as Medicare for all, for healthcare, and the Green New Deal, to address the climate change challenge, which certainly would require legislative action.

125,"Signs of Life, or at Least a Little Honesty, Over at Fox News",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/signs-of-life-or-at-least-a-little-honesty-over-at-fox-news/,"Wow, what did someone put in the watercooler over at the Fox News studios?
Because, bottle it and spread it around.
Fox News personality Steve Hilton, usually a dependable backer of Donald Trump and his administration, surprised by calling out Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for Pompeo’s shameful, profanity-laced attack on NPR journalist Mary Louise Kelly.
Hilton opened eyes by calling Pompeo a “baby” for lacing into Kelly over an interview in which she asked about Ukraine, the nation at the center of Trump’s current impeachment trial.
“For goodness sakes, Mr. Secretary, don’t be such a baby. You should be able to handle tough questions by now and don’t be such a bully,” Hilton said. “Foul-mouthed ranting at a reporter doing her job is an embarrassment to you and the administration.
“You should apologize,” Hilton continued. “And people will think much more of you if you do.”
Hilton is absolutely right, and it’s amazing that he stood up for a journalist doing her job. Because that is exactly what Mary Louise Kelly was doing.
More Fox News personalities–heck, more Trump supporters in general–ought to catch, identify and defend objective reality like this when they see it.
But, yes, Mike Pompeo must apologize.
And hopefully more people now will see the benefits of NPR-delivered news.
Meanwhile, separately, Fox News host Chris Wallace this week took conservative commentator Katie Pavlich to task for trying to spread false information on air while trying to defend Trump in his Senate trial.
“The Senate is not the House, the House did not come with a complete case, and every impeachment beforehand, the witnesses that were called had been called in the House before being brought to the Senate,” she insisted. “So there are questions here about the process.”
Wallace cut her off, by saying, “The fact of the matter was that the whistleblower information was given to the Inspector General, who gave it to the Justice Department. The Justice Department decided not to investigate and that is why it went to the House. So to say that in the Clinton investigation, that these people were interviewed by the House — one, they weren’t — and to say that it wasn’t done by the Justice — it wasn’t done by the Justice Department because the Justice Department refused to carry out the investigation. Get your facts straight.”
Imagine that, a Trump supporter fact-checked in real-time on Fox News.
Now, if this attitude really could spread, to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Fox News would actually earn the “News” in its name.
Why should that be too much to hope for?

126,Trump’s New Craziness (Which Has Nothing to do With Impeachment or Ukraine),https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trumps-new-craziness-which-has-nothing-to-do-with-impeachment-or-ukraine/,"Just in time for all of you tiring of that little thing droning on and on over in the Senate called an impeachment trial.
I mean, sometimes you just can’t make this stuff up.
In a recent speech, Donald Trump’s spiritual adviser, a woman named Paula White, declared that those who practice “demonic manipulation” against Trump and his followers will be broken and unable to “carry forth any plan of destruction, any plan of harm.” 
Okay, stay with me here: It gets better.
She called upon her audience to pray for strength to “come against the marine kingdom” and the “animal kingdom” and demanded that “all satanic pregnancies to miscarry right now.”
Yeah, so she actually said that.
I’m no mental health professional, but I’m pretty sure that the technical term which applies here is “whackadoodle.”
(And can anyone explain to me just what a “satanic pregnancy” is? I mean, without having to screen The Exorcist or Rosemary’s Baby for me.)
And this 53-year-old woman apparently has regular access to the president of the United States.
White is listed as special adviser to the Centers for Faith and Opportunity Initiatives, a federal initiative set up by Trump. She’s also chair of something called the evangelical advisory board for the Trump administration.
White’s relationship with Trump seems to go back, as she was a religious surrogate for the Trump campaign back in 2016.
But dig into her background a little deeper, and what do you find?
A 2007-2011 Senate Finance Committee investigation, which White refused to cooperate with, financial improprieties that could have affected her religious organization’s tax-exempt status.
And there’s more.
Southern Baptist theologian and ethicist Russell D. Moore said that “Paula White is a charlatan and recognized as a heretic by every orthodox Christian, of whatever tribe.”
Essentially, you have an 80s-style televangelist a la Jim and Tammy Bakker, who has direct access to the president of the United States on the basis of apparently little more than she’s an attractive blonde who happens to have a religious credential.
Time was that an occurrence like this would have been a major crisis for any president. This would have put him on political life support until he jettisoned the wacky adviser, paid political penance and tried to move on.
But here we are in the Bizarro world known as the Trump administration, so it’s just what passes for a normal Monday morning.
Election Day can’t get here fast enough.

127,Republicans Could Well Lose by Winning,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/republicans-could-well-lose-by-winning/,"Congressional Republicans have been remarkably candid during Donald Trump’s Senate impeachment trial about how persuasive the case against him has been.
Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida told Politico this week the impeachment managers presented their case to the public as if it were “cable news,” and he praised their use of multimedia.
Meanwhile, the defense team’s case looked like “an eighth-grade book report,” Gaetz said. “Actually, no, I take that back,” he said, adding that an eighth-grader would know how to use PowerPoint and iPads.
Meanwhile, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) told reporters during the first day of the prosecution’s opening arguments that the evidence itself was news to many senators.
“Nine out of 10 senators will tell you they haven’t read a full transcript of the proceedings in the House,” Kennedy said. “And the 10th senator who says he has is lying.”
Despite the fact that the impeachment managers clearly are making their case against Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, it’s obvious that Republican senators intend to vote to acquit Trump.
Yes, this result will certainly please Trump and his minority of diehard supporters.
But it might not come without consequences for the Republicans come November.
Please remember that, according to public opinion polling, more Americans favor removing Trump from office.
Meanwhile, majorities of Americans wanted senators to bring forth new witnesses and documents during the trial–moves which Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) shutdown by holding his GOP caucus together against public opinion.
Americans may well–and should–vote out those senators who have protected Trump.
McConnell may well win the impeachment battle, but lose the war when next year when Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer is elevated to majority leader.

128,"Thanks For The Impeachment Trial Support, Mr Bloomberg",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/thanks-for-the-impeachment-trial-support-mr-bloomberg/,"I thought that Tom Steyer was supposed to be the billionaire pro-impeachment candidate.
Steyer, after all, created the group Need to Impeach and went on a nationwide townhall-style tour to drum up support for the impeachment of Donald Trump.
That was more than two years ago.
But since the House actually impeached Trump on abuse of power and obstruction charges?
Crickets from the Steyer camp. Now that Democrats actually could use a bit of support as they try Trump in the face of a Republican Senate which has made little pretense that they are ready to absolve Trump of his crimes and move on? Apparently, all Steyer wants to talk about are term limits for members of Congress.
We even used this space here a few weeks back to try to coax Steyer to spend part of his fortune on just such a media campaign to back the Democrats in their legitimate attempt to hold Trump to account for his crimes.
Steyer didn’t bite.
But that other billionaire running for the Democratic presidential nomination, thankfully, did.
Mike Bloomberg this week began running a new ad urging lawmakers to vote to remove Trump from office. The 30-second ad will run in 27 states, including Colorado, Maine, Arizona, and North Carolina, where Republican senators are facing difficult re-election efforts.
For Bloomberg, who spent his years running New York City first as a Republican, and then an independent, this new boost to his Democratic compatriots is both a significant and welcome show of loyalty to country and to the Democratic Party which he wishes to now lead as standard-bearer.
By running these ads, Bloomberg is demonstrating a patriotism and love of country, as a majority of Americans believe Trump does deserve to be removed from office–even as Senate Republicans do their darnedest that isn’t the case.
And Bloomberg is showing solidarity with his adopted political party at a moment when Democrats are fighting in the face of Republican intransigence–and Republicans should pay a hefty price for that.
Many grateful Democrats are watching these new ads, exhorting the Senate to remove Donald Trump, and these Democrats each say a little “thank you” to Bloomberg each time the ad comes on.
I know, at least, that this one does.

129,Virginia Is An Example of Democracy in Action,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/virginia-is-an-example-of-democracy-in-action/,"Virginia has suffered greatly at the hands of mass shooters in the last several years.
Some 32 people were killed and another 17 others were wounded on the campus of Virginia Tech by a gunman wielding two semi-automatic pistols.
Several years later, on the afternoon of May 31, 2019, a disgruntled Virginia Beach city employee fatally shot 12 people and wounded four others–again, with two semi-automatic pistols.
So it should be no surprise that Virginia’s voters would demand action on common sense gun reforms in order to prevent any further future massacres.
Unfortunately, the Republicans who had controlled the Virginia legislature for a generation proved to be so ideologically unmovable that they refused to consider anything.
Even when Gov. Ralph Northam (D) called the legislature into a special session last July in response to the Virginia Beach shooting and asked for “votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers” in reaction to the massacre, Republicans adjourned that session in less than two hours without any action.
So it shouldn’t have been surprising that, since Republicans were not listening to the will of the voters, that in November’s elections those same voters dumped the Republicans and put Democrats solidly in charge.
And the Democrats have pledged to pass the reforms the voters are clamoring for.
Unfortunately, folks on the other side of the debate don’t seem to be able to understand elections have consequences.
A variety of gun rights reactionaries from around the country gathered this week in Richmond, Va., to protest what really are modest and popularly supported reforms, such as universal background checks, a limit on handgun purchases of one per month and a “red flag” law allowing authorities to temporarily seize weapons from those deemed a threat.
Certainly these folks are well within their rights to protest and demonstrate against whatever they want.
That doesn’t change the fact, however, that they are extreme on the gun issue and out of the mainstream of Virginia voters.
And just as much as it is within the rights of the gun rights folks to protest, it is well within the rights of the voters of Virginia to see common sense gun safety reforms finally signed into law.
That’s the beauty of democracy in action.

130,January Democratic Presidential Debate Review,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/january-democratic-presidential-debate-review/,"The new year brought us another round of debates, the last until the Iowa Caucuses on February 3. This debate has been the seventh so far, with a shrinking pool of debaters and of issues to discuss. With both Julian Castro and Cory Booker suspending their campaigns prior to the debate, the only candidates qualifying were Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, and Tom Steyer. Here’s how each of them did:
Elizabeth Warren: Since the debate, the major takeaway from the debate has been the leaked post-debate conversation between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. We’ll probably never know if Bernie did say that a woman was unelectable or not, but I think neither Elizabeth Warren nor Bernie Sanders came out of the spat looking good. Elizabeth Warren, hoping to gain support in Iowa, has been shifting towards a more unity-based position. Throughout the debates, she has maintained her stance against corruption and as a progressive, but has transitioned towards a willingness to compromise. She’s declared herself a capitalist, and on Tuesday said she would vote for the USMCA, Donald Trump’s new trade deal with Canada and Mexico. We have yet to know whether these changes will win her support in Iowa, but they have certainly alienated her more progressive supporters, bringing us to her feud with Bernie this week. 
To me, it just seems too perfect. A leak of a sexist comment right before Iowa. A reluctant confirmation from Warren. Warren playing nice during the debate with her “Bernie is my friend” comments.  Then, after the sound has in theory been turned off, Warren directly confronts Bernie, declaring he called her a liar on national TV. Warren has been in politics for a long time, and I don’t believe for a second she didn’t know the audio of her discussion wouldn’t eventually be aired. While Warren’s views certainly appeal to me, and while she performed well both last night and in previous debates, this incident reveals a much more calculated, superficial Warren than people would like to believe exists.  It shows a Warren willing to compromise her ideals for political gain. I understand why she needs to separate herself from Bernie, but I don’t think this was the way to do it.
Bernie Sanders: It’s no surprise to anyone who regularly reads my reviews that I don’t approve of Bernie Sanders’ approach. Yet for most of his supporters, Bernie’s appeal lies in his consistency and he let that trait shine in this past debate. Bernie didn’t vote for the Iraq war, he won’t vote for the USMCA, he won’t compromise on his health care plan–don’t expect anything else. Since his poll numbers seem to be rising, perhaps I’m mistaken in criticizing his approach. For me, Bernie looks naive and outclassed on the debate stage. A Republican Congress won’t work with him at all, and I don’t see a way for any of his lofty ideals to become law without some sort of coalition building with the other side. To potential Sanders voters, Bernie’s strength lies in his consistency, since his voters know exactly who they are electing, and what values he possesses.
That’s where this feud with Warren could have a negative effect on him. Only time will tell whether voters believe that Bernie’s progressive positions conceal a private tendency towards sexism. In the current political climate, where believing women has become a progressive norm, it doesn’t look good that Bernie’s response to the accusations was to deny them and then demean Elizabeth Warren’s concern after the debate. A male candidate saying “Let’s not do this right now” in the face of a female candidate’s anger at him isn’t exactly an empathetic way of dealing with the situation. Bernie Sanders has always presented himself as pro-women, we’ll see if voters still believe him. 
Joe Biden: Biden still remains the Democrats’ leading candidate based on most national polls, despite debates not being his strong suit. I’ve yet to be wowed by a Biden debate performance, but his performance Tuesday I think was one of his better days. He was able to use humor well and to come across as reasonable in a debate centered largely on other candidates. Biden’s record, style, and positions allow him to coast to a fairly good debate performance just by not messing up. Though his stuttering does make him seem old, his persona has always been about being your funny, pragmatic, down-to-Earth Uncle Joe. He has bad debate performances when he’s pressured by other candidates, but he really wasn’t on Tuesday. He was able to present himself as having reflected on his mistakes and prepared to lead. I don’t mean to say that Biden’s performance was exceptional, but I’ve come to realize that Biden’s style doesn’t lend itself well to standout moments. This debate didn’t hurt him, and that may be enough.
Amy Klobuchar: Amy Klobuchar debated very well, and showed how she continually earns her place on the debate stage. She’s really the only candidate who benefitted from the Warren-Sanders sexism argument, and came across as bright and energetic on Tuesday. She also does have a winning record over Republicans, and was able to use that to separate herself from the two other moderate candidates. Klobuchar is able to make her proposals seem grounded and realistic, which I think is the reason why she remains in the race that so many other moderate candidates have dropped out of. Additionally, Klobuchar played up her gender at the debate  in an almost folksy way that allowed her to gain support from an argument between two other candidates. I don’t know much how Klobuchar’s standout debate performances will help her low polling, but if anything is on her side, it’s her debating.
Pete Buttigieg: I’m not really sure what to expect with Pete Buttigieg. With Iowa looming, Buttigieg was pulling out all the stops on Tuesday: his youth, his military service and now his faith. Buttigieg mentioned his faith completely unprompted twice in the debate, but I’m not sure how that will end up helping him in the Iowa caucuses. Most of the faith-based voters in Iowa are Republicans who aren’t voting right now. Buttigieg also took a strange line on climate change, arguing that we need to present climate solutions to appeal to those who think climate science doesn’t work for them. All in all, Buttigieg’s strategy on Tuesday seemed fit for a later race against a different opponent, rather than where he’s at right now. Perhaps I’m wrong about Iowa Democrats, but I was confused by Pete Buttigieg’s debating on Tuesday. 

Tom Steyer: It irritates me that I even have to keep writing about Tom Steyer. He continues to qualify for the debates, and he continues to debate poorly. Steyer acted on Tuesday like he invented impeachment and climate change activism, when up until two weeks ago, he wasn’t even on most people’s radar. While he legitimately has pushed for impeachment for a long time, his climate change activism does not fall into that camp. Steyer made his money from fossil fuels, a fact the moderator astutely pointed out during the debate. It’s nice that he claims to have changed, but his position as “the climate change candidate” feels so hypocritical. Now that he’s rich he can afford to give his money away, and now that he’s profited off exploiting the planet he can afford to try to protect it, I guess. His statements about running the government like a business are Trumpian in nature, as is Kamala Harris-esque strategy of declaring national emergencies as a way to push his policy plans. Steyer looks to me like he paid his way onto the debate stage, and I think that’s why he hasn’t gained much support.

131,We Shouldn’t Have Anyone In The US Standing in the Way of Equal Rights,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/we-shouldnt-have-anyone-in-the-us-standing-in-the-way-of-equal-rights/,"Virginia legislators made history Wednesday as they made the Old Dominion the crucial 38th state to approve the Equal Rights Amendment.
The ERA’s provisions include a guarantee that “equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.”
Virginia Republicans, for decades, prevented the amendment from being approved.
It’s only now that Democrats have taken control of Virginia’s legislature for the first time in a generation that it became possible.
The Equal Rights Amendment is now ratified in 38 states!
Women have been waiting for the #ERA to meet this Constitutional threshold since 1972. A truly historic moment for our country and the fight for equal rights under the law!https://t.co/VWmax1cB10
— Lauren Underwood (@LaurenUnderwood) January 15, 2020
Although Virginia’s passage should be reason for celebration as the crucial state hitting the three-fourths threshold for amendment ratification, there are those–mostly conservatives–who still want to throw up roadblocks in the form of legalese over deadlines for passage which have allegedly expired.
Then there is discrimination in housing, employment and more against lesbian, gay and transgender Americans, which is still legal in about half the states.
The Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives approved legislation last year to correct that, and finally give LGBT Americans the same protection against discrimination enjoyed by African Americans.
Except that the leader of the Republican-controlled Senate refuses even to bring the legislation up for debate.
And then there are the 600,000 residents of Washington DC, who pay their federal income tax just like their fellow Americans but are denied any voting representation in Congress.
Yes, there is more than one remedy to this entirely unamerican situation. But the aforementioned Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, refuses to do anything because–and admits this–DC voters are overwhelmingly Democratic, and granting them voting representation in Congress would place three additional Dems there.
Anyway, are you sensing a pattern?
Whether women, LGBT Americans or DC residents, they all are seeking merely the same rights as their fellow citizens.
The right answer, of course, is to do whatever it takes to enable that to happen.
Instead, what we are left with is a political party, the Republicans, who will look for whatever loophole or mechanism to prevent that from ever happening.
It should make your choice of vote exceedingly clear.

132,A Woman’s Already Been Elected President: Now Let’s Move on to Debate What Matters,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/a-womans-already-been-elected-president-now-lets-move-on-to-debate-what-matters/,"Access to quality healthcare. Timely action against human-caused climate change. The need to address serious income inequality.
These are all issues that the Democratic candidates for president need to address.
Unfortunately, way too much time and effort have been wasted on what has been on what’s been little more than a he said/she said by anonymous proxy, over whether Sen. Bernie Sanders had told erstwhile friend and current rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren that a woman can’t be elected president.
While it’s true that Sanders and Warren are essentially fighting for the same patch of progressive voters on the Democratic Party’s left flank, they should be doing so over matters of substance which could measurably improve voters’ lives rather than what are basically the grown-up equivalent of schoolyard taunts.
Whether Sanders said that or not is irrelevant.
For one, most importantly, it won’t be truly determinative for the outcome of this year’s election.
For another, four years ago, after losing the nomination himself, Sanders did sincerely entice his supporters to vote for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
And finally, despite a quirk of what is fast becoming an antiquated and outmoded Electoral College, was the clear elected choice of a majority of those Americans who cast ballots in 2016 given Clinton won 3 million more votes than Donald Trump.
The fact is that Americans have elected a woman for president. And we may well be doing it again this year, too.
Now let’s get back to arguing about what really matters.

133,Progressives Should Welcome Conservatives to the Climate Change Table: The Planet’s Future May Depend on It,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/progressives-should-welcome-conservatives-to-the-climate-change-table-the-planets-future-may-depend-on-it/,"When it’s come to climate change, the lines of debate have been drawn very distinctly: Democrats and progressives clearly are leading with solutions while Republicans and conservatives have long resisted even the existence of human-generated climate change as a legitimate issue.
Donald Trump famously described climate change as a hoax invented by China.
As that the effects of climate change have become apparent, the majority of the American people side with the Democrats and progressives and their solutions, including the sweeping Green New Deal, according to public opinion polling.
A group of concerned Republicans, co-led by former secretaries of state James Baker and George Shultz, has decided to take climate change seriously and offer what they call a market-oriented solution.
The Republican approach would impose a tax on carbon-based energy, like coal, gas and oil.
“As a result, people would be disincentivized from using heavily-taxed carbon-based energy and encouraged to seek out cleaner products, while businesses would be encouraged to create green energy alternatives free from the levy. What’s more, the revenue from the tax wouldn’t disappear into government coffers,” according to a write up in the New York Post. “Under the Baker-Shultz plan it would go into a special fund, and then be divided into equal shares that would be distributed to all Americans every three months. Backers call this the “carbon dividend.”
Yes, the public back the Democrats on this issue and their solutions to the problem. They could run on this advantage and try to pummel the Republicans on the campaign trail.
Or, the two sides could try to see if they have common ground–for the sake of the planet.

134,What the Supreme Court’s Conservative Lean Means for Election Year,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/what-the-supreme-courts-conservative-lean-means-for-election-year/,"In theory, the Supreme Court was created to function as a nonpartisan judicial branch of the government. However, recent events have shaped the highest court of the land to have a decidedly conservative lean. This lean to the right could intersect with the upcoming 2020 presidential election in several ways that could shape our country and its laws.
Heading into the presidential election of 2016, President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to take over the vacancy that was created by the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. Obama nominated Garland for the position in March 2016. However, the Senate Majority Leader at the time, Mitch McConnell, was clear that the Republican-led Senate would not approve of any of Obama’s appointments for the role. The Supreme Court was left with eight judges until President Donald Trump was elected and able to push through his choice of Justice Neil Gorsuch.

Once appointed, judges remain in their position for life, with very few exceptions to the strict selection process that goes through the U.S. Senate. This makes new appointment possibilities throughout any given president’s term the exception, rather than the rule. Heading into the 2020 election, it is unlikely that any of the current Supreme Court justices will step down. Many liberal politicians are growing increasingly worried about the health of 86-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Ginsburg has been in and out of the hospital for various health concerns throughout the last year.
Conservatives hope that by stacking the courts with justices who subscribe to their ideologies, they will be able to roll back previous rulings to benefit their political positions. Issues that are especially susceptible to being reconsidered include rulings on abortion, immigration and gun rights. Just one significant ruling can change the whole trajectory of any of these issues.
While Chief Justice John Roberts was appointed by President George W. Bush as a conservative-leaning judge, his mostly centrist approach has been hailed by many on both sides of the party divide. As the leader of the Supreme Court, it is up to Roberts to ensure that the court does not let politics play a role in the court’s decisions. Liberals hope that Roberts protects the role of the court as a neutral arbiter.

However, liberals still have concerns about how Roberts will handle things this year. For example, one issue that has some people concerned is partisan gerrymandering. The Supreme Court’s conservative majority has said that they believe this is a political dispute, not a legal one. Last year, much to the chagrin of the liberal minority, Roberts stated that federal courts are not the place to settle these disagreements. Critics fear that this ruling will unfairly influence states to be under one party’s control. This could have a significant influence on this year’s elections. Liberal judges such as Elena Kagan severely disagree with Roberts’ logic and are worried that the federal government is failing to do its job by not fixing what is, in their minds, a constitutional violation.
To fully understand how the U.S. government functions, it is important to understand how these three branches of government work together. When we examine facts like these, it’s clear that though the Supreme Court is meant to be nonpartisan, its conservative lean could mean bad news this election year for liberals. Only time will tell what impact this lean will have on the election, but if the court’s influence continues as it has been, liberals might just be out of luck this election cycle.

135,"Biden, And Republicans vs. ‘Trumplicans’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/biden-and-republicans-vs-trumplicans/,"Republican operative J.W. Verret published an essay with The Washington Post Monday which was as intriguing as it was potentially quite helpful.
Verret’s piece specifically makes a Republican case to support Democrat Joe Biden for president. He specifically asks Republicans to vote for Biden in the states which hold open primaries, and then assuming that the former vice president wins the nomination for them to come out again to vote for Biden in November.
“It isn’t easy to support a Democrat after an attachment to Republican politics that began when I watched the 1992 GOP convention at age 12,” Verret writes.
Well, coming from the other side of the equation, it wasn’t easy to ask for such support, either — at first.
Until I made a crucial distinction.
Verret, himself, indicated some 10 percent of Republican voters believe that Trump should be removed from office.
Those obviously aren’t Trump supporters. But, then, in some important ways Trump supporters have never been true Republicans.
Call them “Trumplicans.”
Democrats can carry on civilized policy discussions–even debates–with the likes of true, thoughtful Republicans like Nicholle Wallace, David Frum, or Steve Schmidt.
What Democrats, be they Joe Biden or anyone else, is why even think that they can pander to the Trumplicans?
You know the Trumplicans. They wear the MAGA clothing. They shout, “Lock her up!” or, alternately, “Send her back!”
These are people like Trump supporter Crystal Minton, who famously said of Trump last year during the prolonged federal government shutdown, “He’s not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.”
The problem is that no US president should be in the business of hurting other Americans, period.
But there is no reasoning with such anger and irrationality.
Biden, or whomever the ultimate nominee should be, shouldn’t even try.

136,Mike Lee Is Right: It Is Unamerican Not to Debate Military Action on Iran,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/mike-lee-is-right-it-is-unamerican-not-to-debate-military-action-on-iran/,"Alright, the temperature is definitely beginning to dip in the Underworld. And I’m certain that I spotted a piggy cruising aloft.
I have agreed with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), one of the most consistently conservative members of the US Senate.
But Lee is absolutely right. It is unamerican. It is also insulting and demeaning for officials from the Trump administration to use the guise of a classified briefing on military action against Iran to tell senators, in Lee’s words, “we need to be good little boys and girls and run along and not debate this in public.”
.@SenMikeLee
: “It is not acceptable for officials within the executive branch of government…to come in and tell us that we can’t debate and discuss the appropriateness of military intervention against Iran. It’s un-American. It’s unconstitutional and it’s wrong.” pic.twitter.com/fVSE6b3EM0
— CSPAN (@cspan) January 8, 2020
Not only is that insulting, it is patently absurd. It is specifically the job of Congress to debate matters of war. And yes, as much of that debate should be public for the benefit of the American people, for whom the Congress works.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) has covered for, and enabled, Donald Trump far too much if he and his appointees feel that they can put Trump’s public relations image ahead of the constitutional duties of the US Senate.
Mike Lee is right. Indignant speeches and tweets are a start.
Now he has to do something about it.

137,Andrew Yang: A 21st Century Ross Perot?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/andrew-yang-a-21st-century-ross-perot/,"Flush with a surprisingly large $16.5 million fundraising haul for the fourth quarter, new horizons are opening up for entrepreneur Andrew Yang as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination.
Now that he is proving to have staying power, Yang is coming up with something of a comparison to another unlikely presidential candidate from the business world, the late Ross Perot.
To be sure, the comparison isn’t complete: Perot made an independent run while Yang clearly is running as a Democrat. But where Perot had his “pet issues” of the federal deficit and keeping jobs in the United States, Yang clearly has his own.
Yang’s being such issues as universal basic income (UBI) and automation of jobs.
Whether or not Yang attains the nomination, like Perot decades before him, Yang’s fundraising prowess means that he can continue to hang in the primary fight where others have had to fall, and in the process he can continue to educate the American people on his issues and make a difference.
Yang could, theoretically, run all the way to the convention talking about the need for UBI, the impact of automation and more.

138,The Senate Has a Duty to Hear Bolton’s Testimony,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-senate-has-a-duty-to-hear-boltons-testimony/,"Former White House national security adviser John Bolton, unceremoniously tossed overboard just a few short months ago by Donald Trump, may now be in a position to exact his revenge.
Bolton announced Monday that he would be willing to testify under subpoena at Trump’s Senate impeachment trial. Bolton, of course, famously described Trump’s hold-up of military aid to Ukraine in exchange for an announcement from the Ukrainian leader of an investigation into American Democrat Joe Biden as a “drug deal,” and wisely wanted no part of it.
Of course, the catch is that Bolton said he would testify by subpoena. Given that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has already declared that he is actively working with the White House on the impeachment trial, he certainly isn’t interested by himself in issuing such a subpoena.
However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is holding the articles of impeachment until such time as McConnell can guarantee a fair trial.
Moreover, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) took to the Senate floor to seek subpoenas for Bolton and other key witnesses. Schumer is right to say that anything less would be a cover-up.
“To Senate Republicans,
Make no mistake: There will be votes on whether to subpoena the documents we’ve identified and to call the four witnesses we’ve proposed: Mulvaney, Bolton, Duffey, and Blair.
Will you support a fair trial, or a Senate-sponsored cover-up? pic.twitter.com/uO2ZC6Ha42
— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) January 7, 2020
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has already expressed her discomfort with McConnell’s cozy approach with Trump.
If Murkowski can lead a few more wayward Republican senators with her, particularly those who are vulnerable for reelection this year, there may be no choice but to issue the needed subpoenas.
And maybe we can get the answers and fair justice that the American people deserve.

During the interview, Jake asked, ” Elizabeth Warren said she would not appoint any high dollar donors as ambassadors and do you make the same commitment?”

Without directly answering the questions, Pete replied, “Anybody I appoint to the office will be based if they are qualify and readiness to do the job. If I am looking agent a senior envoy to deal with Afghanistan and Pakistan and somebody emerges as the right person for that job with the best qualifications, are they going to be disqualified because they came to a house party for my campaign years earlier, no.”
Tapper then pressed on: No, no, big-dollar donors.
Pete: So the maximum is $2,800 and —
Tapper: There are people who are bundlers who raise money for super PACS, and you know how it works.
Pete: For my candidates appointed to any position will be there on the merits and neither qualified or disqualified based on the idea that they supported and believed in my campaign.

The concern among Democrats with accepting money from big-dollar donors is that those donors will have significant influence over the candidates, undermining their integrity and having unfair influence over their decisions.
Another concern is that these big-dollar donors will be able to get powerful positions in the government because of their donations, thereby “buying” their way in, despite them possibly not having the qualifications.
Will Pete Buttigieg bend to his donors if he is elected? Only time will tell.

140,REACTIONS: Was Soleimani Death’s Good or Bad?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/reactions-was-soleimani-deaths-good-or-bad/,"In an interview with Fox News, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul (R) expressed his disapproval of President Trump’s ordered drone strike in Iran that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.
Around the internet, fears of World War III have been trending, notably with Actor Rose McGowan apologizing to Iran, tweeting, “Dear #Iran, The USA has disrespected your country, your flag, your people. 52% of us humbly apologize. We want peace with your nation. We are being held hostage by a terrorist regime. We do not know how to escape. Please do not kill us. #Soleimani“

The Iranian Foreign Minister also condemned the action, saying, “The US’ act of international terrorism, targeting & assassinating General Soleimani—THE most effective force fighting Daesh (ISIS), Al Nusrah, Al Qaeda et al—is extremely dangerous & a foolish escalation.
The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism.”

Soleimani was widely considered the second more powerful in Iran, second to only Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. However, some in the US think, Soleimani is responsible for orchestrating attacks on US troops.

As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with Fox, “Qassem Soleimani has the blood of Americans on his hands, Bret, as does the force that he leads, and America is determined each time we find an organization, institution or an individual that has taken the lives of Americans, it is our responsibility.”
Most Republicans, on the other hand, praised Trump’s show of strength.
“At a time when the president is under impeachment by the Democrats, there’s nothing wrong with him showing strength and resolve in the face of a foreign threat,” said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean.
In the interview, Rand Paul said he was concerned about the lack of an official declaration of war from Congress, despite the likelihood that the conflict will escalate.

“I think without a declaration of war, without Congress and the American people behind it, what you get is a messy mission, a mission of escalating intermittent violence that has no purpose or plan. And the country has not been told to be united, the president said that he did not want to perpetual war in the Middle East, but is adding more and more troops. If you do not want war, you do not send more targets over there.”
As for whether or not Trump had started a war, the Senator commented, ” If you can say that it was an assassination, which is an act of violence, not an act of war, what happens when Iran responds and kills our soldiers? Will that be an active war? In the past when the president has sent people to Congress saying war exists, they don’t ask to declare war, they say a state of war exists. So I think that that may be what happens. If the response to this is an excessive and unfortunate attack on U.S. Soldiers, I think that the state of war will exist.”
His biggest fear though, was the possibility for escalation and war.

“I think that there will be an escalation and a war with Iran. As we look at this, it’s hard to see diplomacy going forward in any form or fashion. And there has not been correct fighting between the Iranian militias and us. It is a very messy situation over there, but people want to ignore that the Iranian militias, for all of their harm — and they have attacked Americans in the Iraqi war, but they have been concerned with the same thing we have had which is ISIS.”
He also commented on how “the door has completely shut on diplomacy” and talks were very unlikely to happen with Iran now that Soleimani had been killed.
“I fear that the Iranians will escalate this, and the president has shown prudence in the past, and I think he will keep the option of diplomacy open, but I think the door has completely shut on diplomacy because I do not see any avenue or any way that talks could begin again. And I have been one in favor of talks. But I think unfortunately diplomacy is dead in the Middle East he ran.”

Similarly, the top 2020 Presidential election contenders slammed Trump’s decision to order the drone strikes that killed Soleimani.
“President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox,” said former Vice President Joe Biden.
According to Reuters, “[the] protracted conflict could reshape an election that has so far been dominated by domestic issues, such as healthcare and money in politics […] While that could be a plus for the leading Democratic candidates such as Biden, who has stressed his foreign policy experience and credentials, lesser-known contenders could have a harder time being heard.”
New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, however, said that the media’s reaction to Soleimani’s killing was an embarrassment.
“He [Soleimani] has exported global terrorism, and he has blood of American troops on his hands. He has killed hundreds of American troops,” she said.

She called out the Washington Post, who referred to General Soleimani as “revered.”
Breaking news: Airstrike at Baghdad airport kills Iran’s most revered military leader, Qasem Soleimani, Iraqi state television reports https://t.co/NbZW4DaWvD
— The Washington Post (@washingtonpost) January 3, 2020
“He should not be revered and The Washington Post should apologize and should retract that statement,” Stefanik said.
Ultimately though, it boils down to this: Was General Soleimani responsible for the deaths of Americans? Can he be considered a terrorist? Did the benefits of killing him outweigh the effects of heightened conflict with Iran? And, in the long run, will this move save or cost American lives?
Republicans generally saw Soleimani as a terrorist and his assassination as a show of strength in the US and a good thing.
Democrats condemn the assassination because of the heightened risk of war, though some see Soleimani as a terrorist, while some see him as more neutral.

141,Trump May Well Find Racism Two-sided Sword,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trump-may-well-find-racism-two-sided-sword-2/,"Donald Trump came to power by recognizing that, in the midst of great ethnic shifts underway in the United States, he could manipulate the remnant racist resentments of segments of white America.
Whether it was by declaring a wall must be built along the southern border to keep out Mexicans who could be “rapists” and worse, declaring there were “very fine people” on both sides of the racist protest in Charlottesville, Va., telling non-white American congresswomen to “go back” to the countries they came from, and more, Trump has actively stoked racism in this country as a means of firing up his political base.
Now comes evidence that another strong political constituency is saying, “Enough!” to Trump’s attempt to renormalize racism in America.
A majority of black Americans are more interested in voting in the 2020 presidential election than they were in 2016, according to a national survey of black voters and non-voters, reported by Axios.
Despite his repeated dishonest puffery, Trump won his Electoral College victory for the presidency only by a slim popular vote margin of some 80,000 votes in three States: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
Moreover, Trump’s victory was aided by Black voter turnout, which declined significantly in 2016 nationally and in key swing states.
This new survey as published by Axios strongly suggests that Trump’s long pattern of racism is motivating these Black voters to reverse that and come back out in 2020 in higher numbers again.

That’s not going to be good news for Trump as he struggles to find the votes for a second term.
But if Black and African American voters do come out in force on Election Day to punish Trump, it should send the message that, “No, racism has no place in American society.”

142,John Lewis Deserves the Thoughts and Prayers of all Americans Now,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/congress/john-lewis-deserves-the-thoughts-and-prayers-of-all-americans-now/,"The tragic news that Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) has Stage 4 pancreatic cancer should be enough to stir the hearts of each and every American.
But I fear the equal tragedy is that, in fact, in our tribalistic and celebrity-obsessed culture, too few of our fellow Americans will ascribe to Lewis the deep respect, admiration and caring he deserves.

Yes, the 79-year-old John Lewis has served in the halls of Congress since 1987, and yes, he is even often called “the conscience of the Congress.”
But John Lewis is no mere politician. That’s not why he deserves our immediate thoughts and prayers, now facing such a grim prognosis.
No, he ought to transcend partisanship for all Americans, as John Lewis is a true American hero.
Not only was Lewis a leader in the struggle for civil rights and racial equality during the 1960s, he was repeatedly attacked physically and beaten for his work.
An epic photo.
We’re in your corner,
Congressman #JohnLewis. pic.twitter.com/Bmq6sgkfNe

And yet Lewis never gave up on the ideals of nonviolent change and progress.
Lewis says that he will bring the same tenacity to fighting his very deadly disease. And whether Democrat or Republican, young or old, or black or white, you owe it to learn more about the John Lewis legacy for now is the time he needs our support.

143,"Yang and Booker’s Friendship: Maybe There’s Hope for the Rest of Us, Too",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/yang-and-bookers-friendship-maybe-theres-hope-for-the-rest-of-us-too/,"It’s natural that at this time of year that we would look for cheer and warmth wherever we can find it.
This is particularly true when you have circumstances such as that with Donald Trump’s new website, which is designed not to bring families together but rather–in usual Trumpian fashion–sow discord and pit family member against family member.

So it was particularly heartwarming for CNN to profile a genuine friendship on the campaign trail for the Democratic presidential nomination between entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker.
It’s not uncommon to find colleagues on the campaign trail. But a true friendship between two competitors vying for the same presidential nomination?
That is a much rarer thing indeed.
It was reflected in the recent Democratic presidential debate, where Yang made the stage but Booker did not.
During the course of the debate, Yang announced that he “missed Cory” and then he made a prediction: “I think Cory will be back.”
Yang and Booker’s friendship also manifests everywhere from the trail, to the friends’ Twitter feeds.

— Andrew Yang???? (@AndrewYang) November 2, 2019
Make no mistake: neither of these men are playing around. The Democratic presidential nomination is too valuable a prize to not go all the way.
But Yang and Booker prove that very individual rivals can fight it out for a political objective, but at the literal end of the day come together in unity, good will and affection.

And there is certainly a lesson for the rest of us in there, too. If only we take heed.

144,Why Bloomberg is Right to Run,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/democrats/why-bloomberg-is-right-to-run/,"After months of hesitation, former NYC mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg has announced his intention to run for the President of the United States in 2020. The decision has already attracted much attention, from both the left and right, and it seems like Bloomberg is being attacked from all sides of the American political spectrum.
The Left sees in him another rich, old, white, male Wall Street billionaire. For some progressives, being a representative of even one of these categories is enough to draw hostility, not to mention when they are all combined in one person.

In the interim, for the right, Bloomberg is just another leftist violating Second Amendment rights and climate change crusader. Yet, for all the polarizing ire directed against Michael Bloomberg, at such a pivotal point in the history of the United States, he is the only Democrat not only capable of beating Trump in 2020 but also addressing America’s modern challenges pragmatically and by forging bipartisanship and uniting the country.
According to the set of surveys by The New York Times Upshot and Siena College, among registered voters, only former vice-president Joe Biden leads incumbent President Donald Trump in six battleground states. Bernie Sanders is deadlocked with the president, whereas another Democratic presidential hopeful, Elizabeth Warren, wins only one state over Trump.
“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality. The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,” said former President Barack Obama in his recent meeting with wealthy Democratic donors.

Though he did not mention any candidates by name, it could be easily inferred that many of Warren and Sanders’s proposals, such as Medicare for All, free college tuition, and massive wealth and income taxes on the rich, are too radical for an average American.
While appealing to the core Democratic electorate, politicians advocating these ideas, as could be seen from the polls, will hand over victory to Trump in the general election. At the same time, Joe Biden, despite being appealing to many constituencies and so far beating Trump in national polls, can’t escape the Ukraine scandal, regardless of whether or not he and his son are innocent, after impeachment trial goes to Senate.
Furthermore, Donald Trump is likely to use the case of Ukraine to smear his opponent, even if the accusations are unfounded — this is not to mention Biden’s age problems, such as forgetting in which state he is on the stage.
Bloomberg is disliked by ultra-left progressives, but he could win over some moderate Republicans and centrists. Some might object that he will lose people that would have otherwise voted for Sanders and Warren.

However, in today’s increasingly polarized political environment, many people will likely vote for Bloomberg, just for not being Trump. A three-term mayor of the financial capital of the world, Bloomberg has considerable executive experience. A self-made man and financier, he understands economics and its intricacies.
These factors may be significant campaign assets in the general elections, but might undermine his chances of winning the Democratic nomination, where politicians are becoming more and more hostile towards the private sector. Because of Bloomberg’s unpopularity among Democrats, there is a chance that he loses Democratic primary.
However, with President Trump’s approval ratings being under 50%, Bloomberg might succeed in attracting centrist moderates who, while disliking Trump personally, support his economic policies and are ambivalent about progressives’ sweeping agenda.

If Democrats truly want to win in 2020 and stop Trump’s derailing of America’s fundamental democratic institutions and his assault on principles on which the U.S. was founded, they need to elect a centrist candidate capable of tackling rising polarization and partisanship on the American political scene.

145,December Democratic Presidential Debate Review,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/december-democratic-presidential-debate-review/,"As we all go home to see our families, we have one more political subject to discuss at the dinner table: the latest Democratic debate. This debate, held Thursday December 19, took a while to get going, with the first hour or so consisting of softball questions that didn’t distinguish between candidates. The last question tried to incorporate a holiday theme, and was similarly disappointing. Here’s my holiday wish for better questions next time.

With only seven candidates qualifying, the debate felt more under control, but had many familiar faces missing.  While many of the original 20-plus candidates have dropped out, candidates like Cory Booker or Julian Castro are technically still in the race, though not on the stage. We’ll see if any of them rebound and qualify next time. With that in mind, here is my review of the December Democratic debate, from best to worst. 
Amy Klobuchar: Klobuchar, in my opinion, was the star of this debate. She was well-prepared, constantly referenced her record, and actually praised other candidates while defending her points of view. It’s true that Klobuchar hasn’t been the front-runner and as such, hasn’t taken heat in the same way. At the same time, she has maintained a very professional high ground and so her remarks at other candidates don’t feel like immature bickering. Klobuchar was able to claim a position as “the woman candidate,” even with Elizabeth Warren on the same stage. She highlighted her moderate positions very explicitly, and is clearly hoping to capitalize on the drop in Joe Biden’s popularity. Time will tell how Amy Klobuchar will fare once she becomes more relevant to the race as a whole, but I expect her support to rise following this debate. I’m not sure how many Democrats will actually buy into her unity message if she becomes a likely nominee, but I guess we’ll have to wait and see. 
Andrew Yang: I don’t like the Freedom Dividend idea, but Andrew Yang has shown why he’s still in the field. Yes, I groan every time he connects everything on the planet to Universal Basic Income, but Yang is starting to put forward other ideas, and was finally given the airtime to share them. Despite being the definition of a rich businessman, Yang has positioned himself as a hardworking child of immigrants, the one candidate of color left. He intelligently has been using the Freedom Dividend in debates as almost a social justice idea, marketing it as the perfect answer to any question on gender or race. Several of the leading candidates very visibly struggle with racial issues, so this was a bold but effective strategy. I definitely have to hand this debate to the less prominent candidates who finally get a chance to speak. Like Klobuchar, Yang may falter when he becomes a frontrunner, but that wasn’t happening at the debate. 
Joe Biden: While I have yet to see a stunning performance from Joe Biden, this was one of his better debates. He was not asked about his son or sharply criticized, but he managed to avoid the attacks aimed at the millionaires and billionaires, despite fitting squarely in that sphere.Biden also claimed a main talking point against the progressive candidates. When Bernie was pressed about passing Medicare-for-All with a potentially conservative congress, Biden was there to claim that we have to work with the people we have, not dream of something else, and then to back it up.  He didn’t seem old, didn’t deflect, and was able to use the Obama legacy positively for once. It is true that Biden did not speak as much as usual, but he did not have any of the tone deafness that both Buttigieg and Sanders fell into, so I count this as a win for him. 
Elizabeth Warren: Not bad for Elizabeth Warren, but I think this debate doesn’t move her one way or the other. We sort of know what to expect with Warren now: detailed policy plans and critiques of corruption. Her attack on Pete Buttigieg over closed-door fundraisers did more to hurt Buttigieg than it did to help her, as he astutely revealed that she, too, was a rich person who had made use of similar fundraisers in her past. Warren’s anti-corruption points are valid, but this past debate highlighted the issue with using purity tests as a campaign strategy–no one is ever pure enough. Warren’s thoroughness and intelligence make her the leading progressive candidate over Bernie Sanders, but she’s become fairly predictable, and has not made headway towards fixing her main issue, attracting non-college educated white voters.
Tom Steyer: The debate announcers on the network I was watching (PBS) thought Steyer did a great job, but I really don’t see it. He qualified for the debate, which means his support is fairly substantial, but he seems fake to me in a way that’s hard to pin down. I think it’s probably that he is a billionaire who’s only recently come onto the scene, and yet acts like impeachment and climate change reform were his idea all along. Tom Steyer wants to be the climate change candidate, but didn’t Jay Inslee already try that in September? I also found his strategy of attacking Donald Trump repeatedly somewhat insincere. It’s the Democratic debate, nobody on stage is a Trump supporter. Attacking the president to me is a cheap shot that wins you cheap points as everyone can do it. 
Pete Buttigieg: I know it’s harder for Mayor Pete now that he’s the frontrunner, but that wine cave example was just too easy. For those who may have missed the debate, Buttigieg was sharply critiqued for holding closed-door, very expensive fundraisers in a wine cave in order to support his campaign. Not to be too blunt, but to me, it appears like an incredibly stupid move for Buttigieg to make. He already struggles to connect with non-white voters, and has a bad record on race. He  already is being accused of being too cozy with the rich in his younger years as a consultant. Why would he give other candidates this ammunition? Buttigieg had risen in my estimation, and his strategy appeared to be working. I was incredibly disappointed that he would fall into such a silly trap. 

Bernie Sanders: Last, but not least, is Bernie Sanders. This was not a good night for Bernie. I’ve admitted in the past that I’m at least a little biased since I disagree with Bernie on some major plans, but I think it was fairly obvious he did not do well. His response to a question on race, a subject where Bernie has repeatedly fallen short, was a redirection to a climate change question. This shows a lack of adaptability, but also an insensitivity towards a group he needs to court. Worse still, the moderator called him out on the dodge, and forced him to answer the question. Bernie showed a similar stiffness when asked about Medicare-for-all. He insisted that he would push the bill through somehow even with congressional disapproval, an extreme position that was quickly rebutted by Amy Klobuchar. In such a polarized political environment, Bernie’s attitude of “it’ll just happen because it’s a good idea” fell short. It made him appear old in a field where age has been a serious question. I predict Elizabeth Warren will continue to take from Bernie’s supporters and emerge as the only progressive candidate as we get closer to election time unless something changes.

146,Citizenship Law Reflects Dark Chapter in Indian History,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/citizenship-law-reflects-dark-chapter-in-indian-history/,"It remains one of the darkest and most contentious points of Indian history: the 1947 partition into Hindu-dominant India and Muslim-dominant Pakistan.
Partition caused the displacement of 14 million people, the deaths of as many as 2 million along with much suffering.

And now, nearly three-quarters of a century later, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, seem intent to make the same mistakes all over again.
Despite a history of a Hindu majority, India has always enjoyed a secular government and a respect for varying faiths and ethnic groups.
The Modi government’s new citizenship law tests that tradition as it allows the government to make distinctions between Muslims and non-Muslims, and to brand Muslim citizens as illegal immigrants if they lack the necessary documents to prove Indian citizenship.
The new law has sparked major protests across India, which have left 23 so far dead (including three children) and more than 3,000 under arrest.
Protesters worry that the upcoming nationwide citizenship registry, or NRC, for which everyone will be required to provide documentary evidence of citizenship, will be used to deprive Indian Muslims citizenship under the new law, leaving them stateless.
India is home to nearly 200 million Muslims, one of the largest Muslim populations in the world.
Although Modi is trying to argue that the law isn’t so sinister, Amit Shah, Modi’s closest aide, was quoted earlier this year as saying, “First, we will bring the Citizenship Amendment Bill and will give citizenship to the Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jain and Christian refugees, the religious minorities from the neighboring nations.
“Then, we will implement NRC to flush out the infiltrators from our country.”
No, Shah clearly reveals this law to be what it is: bigoted evil.
What is the United States doing in all of this?

Sam Brownback, the U.S. ambassador for international religious freedom, urged India to “abide by its constitutional commitments, including on religious freedom.”
That’s fine as far as it goes, but much more needs to be done. Of course, this is same the Trump administration known for multiple iterations of its own punitive Muslim ban, so how much can we expect?
Still, as has been the case in other important foreign policy hotspots, bipartisan pressure needs to build now from Capitol Hill.
Other Western democracies must also speak out.
This law cannot stand.

147,"Sorry, Tom Steyer, Term Limits Don’t Work",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/sorry-tom-steyer-term-limits-dont-work/,"Billionaire Tom Steyer, in his run for the Democratic presidential nomination, has been running tens of millions of dollars worth of advertising.
One of the ads which has run most often lately is called “Too Bad,” in which Steyer says that if Americans want universal healthcare, solutions for climate change and a fair economy, we must embrace term limits for members of Congress, to prevent service in Congress from being “a lifetime appointment” and presumably take back power from these congressional lifers.
Sorry, Mr. Steyer. You have it all wrong.

First of all, before Steyer, do you know who made congressional term limits a central issue? Republicans. Republicans were pushing term limits full tilt in the very early 90s. They had been the permanent minority party in the House for 40 years at that time, and they didn’t see any other way of ever gaining a majority again except by term limiting the incumbent Democrats.
Then came Newt Gingrich, his Republican Revolution, the 1994 takeover of Congress, and suddenly after that when you mentioned term limits to Republicans, all you heard were crickets.
But big, “wave” elections make up the first reason that Steyer is wrong about term limits. Service to Congress is not an appointment. It’s very much an election, and the big elections of 1994, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2018 very much demonstrate that if voters bother to show up to the polls, they certainly can replace those who represent them.
There are a number of other reasons why legislative term limits are a lousy idea.
“Term limits are the surest way to weaken the legislative branch and empower the executive branch. Term limits are also a great way to empower special interests and lobbyists,” Lee Drutman wrote in Vox, citing studies of the effects of term limits in the states where they were enacted. “Basically, what term limits do is shift power toward those who are there for the long haul.
Drutman isn’t the only one to argue against term limits.
Opening with this 1788 quote from Roger Sherman, “Nothing renders government more unstable than a frequent change of the persons that administer it,” the respected Brookings Institution in Washington DC published “Five reasons to oppose congressional term limits.”
The real crisis facing our democracy isn’t the length of a lawmaker’s career, it’s the literally untold billions of dollars–much of it in “dark,” unreported money–from corporations and the super rich can buy access and influence in the government. Access and influence that you and I, often sadly, can no longer hope to match.

This is a direct result of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision and its striking away at so much campaign finance law.
That’s the battle we ought to be fighting. But as one of the super rich, perhaps Mr. Steyer is too close to the problem to see it.

148,Calculating Political Bias and Fighting Partisanship with AI,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/calculating-political-bias-and-fighting-partisanship-with-ai/,"In our hyper-partisan political climate, discerning between fake and real news has grown even more so challenging. Even worse, though, is when political bias is thrown in the mix and facts and opinions are twisted.
We’ve always valued transparency here at The Bipartisan Press, by labeling the bias of all our articles and in order to make the process more systematic and nonpartisan, we pursued the use of AI and natural language processing to predict political bias.

Classifying political bias is considered a Natural Language Processing, commonly abbreviated NLP, task. That means it relates to the processing and analysis of textual content. NLP is a branch of AI, or Artificial Intelligence, which is building systems (usually algorithms) that can mimic human intelligence.

Machine learning, which is teaching and building systems that can learn from experience is usually considered a branch and method of AI and building AI systems. In this case, machine learning is what we are going to be using to build the NLP model that will predict political bias.
In order to build a successful machine learning model, a dataset of prelabeled data containing the inputs and wanted outputs of the model are needed. In our case, this means the text content we want to feed the ML model and the bias values that we want to be outputted. This is the data that we will show to the model and have it learn from.
Once we have all our dataset ready, we will need to set up the actual model, which will be looking at and learning from the dataset to output the targeted values. There are countless libraries, parameters, and architectures in which we can build our model on. Two of these libraries are called Tensorflow and Pytorch (which we both will touch on during our experiment). These base libraries simplify the work needed to set up basic algorithms and layers in the ML model.

Running on top of these frameworks are libraries like Keras, which further make the process more simple. We will be using Keras and FastAI in our process.
Now, within these libraries are different configurations for the ML model. These configurations include things like max word count, batch size (the number of data pieces to show the model at one time) and more. The model also has various “layers” that carry out various functions. In NLP ML models, some layers remember certain words, some look for word relationships, some analyze how the text is structured.
If you combine many layers of various functions together, you can form an architecture. The two main architectures we will be using are LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory, the backbone of ULMFit) and Transformer networks (BERT), which we won’t go into detail here, but are basically just different configurations for the model to learn with.
Once we have assembled our ML model and dataset, we move on into training the model, or actually showing the model the data and having it learn to classify political bias. We will go through many rounds of training to let the ML model learn the most it can from the data.

After training the model, we need to evaluate how well the model is doing and how accurate the predicted outputs are compared to the actual outputs. We do this on a separate dataset called the “validation” set that we didn’t allow the machine to train on during training. There are many metrics we can use to judge the performance of the model. For simplicity, we will be using accuracy (#correct / total) for classification tasks (ie, “right” or “left) and mean of absolute error (aka MAE, absolute value of (actual – predicted) for each data entry, then the mean of all the values) for regression tasks (continuous output, ie 1.0 through 10.0).
Keep in mind, this is a vastly simplified process of how we built our ML model and the actual process had many more steps and experimentation.
Past Experiments
There have been attempts by others in the past to predict political bias. Linalgo built a classifier that used five labels for the data, achieving 70% accuracy. Researchers at Stanford also built a three label classifier, achieving 83% accuracy. MIT’s CSAIL has also built a three label classifier achieving 70% accuracy. However, these studies are slightly dated and only cover classification, and with the release of new, large, pre-trained models like BERT and GPT-2, we wondered how we would put those to use in a regression task (continuous variable).

Dataset
In order to train our AI, we need to first build a dataset to train it on. Ultimately, we ended up trying out four different datasets to find out which ones were the most accurate.
Our first dataset was based on AdFontesMedia’s list of articles with prelabeled per-article bias (on a scale of -42 to 42). We extracted the article content using the Python newspaper library and used the bias values as the prediction target. The total dataset consisted of ~1200 entries totaling ~1 million words. The distribution of bias is as follows (further left is more left-biased, center is more neutral, right is more right biased):
In an attempt to expose the ML model to a greater variety of text, we then extracted 10k articles using webhose.io and labeled them with numbers representing the bias value converted with data from MediaBiasFactCheck. This dataset had significantly more noise than the prior one since the generalization was made that all the articles published by an outlet have the same bias, which is obviously false. Here is the distribution of the data by sites and by bias:
The distribution by domain isn’t very even, as a majority of articles were from CNN and Breitbart. Bias-wise though, the skew was less obvious.

Our third dataset with based on the AllTheNews dataset which contained ~100k articles and was labeled the same way as the above. Here’s the distribution for this.
This bias distribution was more skewed on this with ~65k articles being labeled with right bias versus ~45k left.
Our fourth dataset was the Ideological Books Corpus, which is slightly different because it contains sentences annotated with ideology (2025 liberal sentences, 1701 conservative sentences, and 600 neutral sentences). We ultimately ended up not using this because of the limited data.
Model Layout
We wanted the output to be a range of numbers (ie, 0-42) showing the degree of bias, as well as negative or positive denoting left or right bias.
We considered two different setups for this:
Create a regression model that classifies both the degree of bias (ie, 0-42) and the direction of bias (-42 to 42) at the same time. This will be denoted as a “full” model in the rest of the article.
Create a regression model that only classifies the degree of bias (0-42). Then make a separate classification model that classifies direction. (-1 = left, or 1 = right ) and combine the results (ie, 18 * -1 = -18 bias). This will be denoted as a “dual” model in the rest of the article.

Architecture
We experimented with a variety of architectures and pre-trained models for the AI, including transformers, LSTM networks, BERT, GPT, and ULMfiT. Ultimately, we found that BERT, transformer-based models were the most accurate in predicting both bias and direction.
Building the Model
Full Regression
ULMfiT
We first built a ULMfiT full regression (-42 to 42) model using FastAI’s native implementation (AWD LSTM) on the first two datasets. A batch size of 64 and train:validation split of 8:2 was used throughout the experiment.
We didn’t train it on the third one due to the excessive computation resources required that we lacked. Our language models (pre-trained from Wikitext-103) achieved the following accuracies:
Dataset #1: 34% accuracy
Dataset #2: 42% accuracy
From there, we trained a regressor and achieved the following mean of absolute errors:
Dataset #1: 10.23
Dataset #2: 4.23
Despite the seemingly low error deviation on the second model with dataset #2. we actually found the first model to be marginally more accurate is predicting actual bias, especially the direction of bias (left or right). This is probably due to the more specific labels assigned to dataset #1 versus the per-outlet labels with dataset #2.
Sampling the large, All The News dataset, we performed a separate validation regarding just the accuracy of predicting the direction and found that model #1 only had an accuracy of 62% and model #2 only had an accuracy of 47%.

Best Political Bias Prediction Model: Dataset #1, ULMFit, 10.23
BERT
Adapting the code for classification with BERT, we made it work with regression, using a batch size of 8 and a max_sequence_length of 512. Here are our regressor M.A.E.s for BERT:
Dataset #1: 7.94
Dataset #2: 3.04
Despite the seemingly low absolute error for dataset #2 again, the results were still pretty inaccurate on the separate test set, with D#1 outperforming D#2 by 28% in terms of just classifying left and right (85% vs 56%).
(New) Best Political Bias Prediction Model: Dataset #1, BERT, 7.94
Keras (LSTM)
Using the Keras library and Tensorflow, we also built a linear regression model. We used a max_sequence_length of 500, and 1 LSTM layer with 100 memory units with drop out, and a vocab of 50000. We attained a mean of absolute error of 9.3 with Dataset #1 and an M.A.E of 3.5 with datasets #2 and #3 combined, but separate testing once again proved the second and third datasets to be quite inaccurate.
(Still) Best Political Bias Prediction Model: Dataset #1, BERT, 7.94
Conclusion
From this, we were able to conclude that BERT had the best performance versus ULMFit, achieving the lowest mean of absolute error out of all the models, as well being the most accurate in determining the direction of bias.

Dual Model Ensemble
Next, we built the dual model ensemble using the similar architectures that we used above.
ULMFit
Splitting the dataset along into the categories “left” and “right” by assigning negative values “left” and positive values “right” from the datasets, we first built a language classifier based on Datasets #1, 2, 3, and 4 (ideology corpus).
Our fine-tuned language models achieved the following accuracies:
Dataset #1: 34% accuracy
Dataset #2: 42% accuracy
Dataset #3: 40% accuracy*
Dataset #4: 30% accuracy
Following the same procedure as our regression model, we then trained a text classifier on the two labels. Accuracies are, once again, below:
Dataset #1: 72% accuracy
Dataset #2: 91% accuracy
Dataset #3: 95% accuracy*
Dataset #4: 65% accuracy
Curiously enough, the models achieved only ~2/3 of the validation accuracy above on the separate test set.
In order to build a bias-only model, we then took the absolute values of all the numbers and trained using the language model above, trained regressor on it. The regressor achieved the following M.A.E’s (Dataset #4 was omitted due to the lack of individual bias values needed for regression, #3 was omitted due to lack of resources):
Dataset #1: 6.45
Dataset #2: 2.06
To produce a final value, we multiplied the direction (-1 or 1) by the bias value.
Due to the low accuracy of the directional classifier, we weren’t able to attain accurate results using this model setup.
*the language model of dataset #3 wasn’t completely trained to its potential, possibly bringing the maximum accuracies down.

(Still) Best Political Bias Prediction Model: Dataset #1, BERT, 7.94
BERT
Using the same BERT setup, we proceeded to build the same models using the bidirectional transformer architecture. Results are below:
Classification
Dataset #1: 68% accuracy
Dataset #2: 92% accuracy
Dataset #3: 96% accuracy
Dataset #4: 56% accuracy
Bias-only Regression (MAE)
Dataset #1: 5.02
Dataset #2: 1.07
Similar trends we observed that mirrored our previous experiments. The classification accuracies were significantly when tested separately versus the validation accuracy. Our best classification model (BERT Dataset #3) only had a 69% accuracy on the withheld test set.
Furthermore, our regression model using dataset #2 also yielded quite inaccurate and volatile results, despite the low error deviation.
(Still) Best Political Bias Prediction Model: Dataset #1, BERT, 7.94
Combining Models
Hoping to boost the accuracy, we experimented with combinations of the classification models, by adding the probabilities of the categories from different models and taking the high one.
Our highest final (testing) accuracy, 77%, came from the BERT model on dataset #3, and the ULMFit model on dataset #2.
(Still) Best Political Bias Prediction Model: Dataset #1, BERT, 7.94

Conclusion
Despite the significant accuracy boost from combining two different classification models, the single, full regression model still outperformed the dual-ensemble model, possibly because it was able to learn more complex relationships and correlations that the simplified, dual models weren’t able to learn.
We were also able to conclude that using the BERT transformer architecture was considerably more accurate than LSTM networks. Furthermore, we also found out that dataset #1 yielded the most accurate results when trained on, probably due to the least amount of noise in it, despite other datasets having more data.
Building (Better) Models
Now that we were able to generally establish which dataset, model configuration, and architecture worked the best, we set out on building an even more accurate model to predict and classify political bias. Having already experimented with various learning rates and parameters, our options were to either:
Increase dataset size
Try a different model
We were pretty limited in terms of attaining a larger dataset since AdFontesMedia doesn’t add new sources very frequently, and so we decided to try a new model architecture.
After a bit of research, we found several new architectures that outperformed BERT on benchmarks like GLUE. With this, we built a regression model by adapting several guides we found, including here and here. The models we tried are below.

RoBERTa
Created by Facebook, RoBERTa is a more robustly trained version of BERT –it’s been trained for longer and with more data. Following a similar setup with the BERT models above, we tested both the “base” model and the “large” (more parameters) one. Using the based model, we achieved an MAE of 7.55, a marked improvement over BERT’s 7.9. On the “large” model, we attained a breakthrough with an MAE of 6.03, a 25% lower error deviation than the initial BERT model and a 20% improvement versus the “base” model.
(New) Best Political Bias Prediction Model: Dataset #1, RoBERTa (large), 6.04
XLNet
XLNet is a different transformer architecture that is comparable in performance to RoBERTa We attempted to set up an XLNet model, but were unable to fit even the base model on our 16 GB GPU with a batch size of 1 and FP16, so we weren’t able to test out its performance.
Albert
Albert is another variation of BERT trained by Google that achieves even better results than RoBERTa on some benchmarks. We also attempted to fine-tune the Albert model but were only able to achieve a min. MAE of 10.02. We tested out the “large-v1” “xlarge-v2” “xxlarge-v2” and “large-v2” models.

(Final) Conclusion
Facebook’s Roberta model had significantly better performance than the initial BERT model, achieving an error deviation of only 6.04. This is the model we currently have deployed to rate our articles.
Interesting Observations
While testing various models, we noticed several interesting observations.
Our largest BERT left-right classification model was adept in classifying bias by domain. For example, it correctly classifies, when given just the domain, “cnn.com”, “washingtonpost.com”, and “nytimes.com” as Left, while “foxnews.com”, “washingtonexamer.com”, and “nypost.com” were Right.
The BERT + RoBERTa regression models were not adept in recognizing short ideological sentences like “we need more gun control” and “gun control is bad”
The BERT regression model assigned moderate bias values (range: -9 to 9) when given the input of only names like “trump”, “clinton”, and “bernie sanders.” We observed similar results when we only inputted the terms “democrats” (14.5) and “republicans” (-10.1).
RoBERTa, on the other hand, returned much more neutral results (range: -1 to 1) when given the same terms, showing the increased accuracy of the model versus the base BERT model.

Areas for Improvement
Dataset – Increasing the size of the dataset should expose the ML model to a greater variety of data and topics, increasing accuracy.
More architectures (Ernie, XLnet, Albert) – Different architectures process text differently. Changing the architecture type may improve the results for this task.
Better data preprocessing – The content was put in the dataset directly after being scrapped with newspaper. By stripping out unnecessary content like “Advertisement” text, related post widgets, or newsletter subscription forms would probably have helped increased accuracy as there’s less noise.
Larger batch sizes – The use of larger batch sizes could potentially increase the accuracy of the models, but require more GPU memory.
Try Out Our Classifier
We have created a tool that allows you to test out our dual model ensemble and combined direction classifier. We are also considering the release of the model and its weights for public use. This model’s performance is lower than our production model, which, at this time, we won’t be releasing or allow the public use of.
Bias Classifier
As time goes on, the state of NLP will continue to improve and so will the political climate. With this, we will continue to improve our AI in pursuit of better accuracy. Subscribe to our newsletter to be the first to know of new developments.

149,Stephen King’s Latest Antagonist,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/stephen-kings-latest-antagonist/,"Novelist Stephen King has made a career out of crafting stories with antagonists readers were ready to see done in by the end of the story.
Now King, a longtime resident of Maine, is ready to vanquish his freshman Democratic member of Congress for what was a truly bone-headed vote on Donald Trump’s impeachment.
Golden, who represents the state’s more-conservative, Trump-leaning Second Congressional District, was the only House Democrat to split his vote: voting to impeach Trump on abuse of power but voting no on obstruction of Congress.

Certainly, Golden found himself in a situation similar to many of his Democratic colleagues who hail from Trump-friendly districts when it came to the impeachment vote.
Most did the right thing, set politics–and even their own re-elections–aside, and did the only logical and right thing: vote for both articles of impeachment.
If Golden, who became the first to defeat an incumbent in that district since 1916, however thought that he was being clever and splitting the difference by voting for only one article of impeachment he wound up pleasing no one instead of everyone.
Just from the perspective of logic, the way Golden split his decision made no sense. Trump, for weeks and months, resisted– and ordered others to resist–fully lawful congressional subpoenas. Based on that alone, there is no way not to find Trump obstructed Congress…. unless you are a partisan and dishonest Republican saying anything to defend Trump.
And in the process, Golden has attracted quite a powerful enemy in the form of novelist King, who happens to be one of Golden’s constituents.
If my congressman, Jared Golden, votes for only one article of impeachment, I will work with all my might to see him defeated next year.
— Stephen King (@StephenKing) December 17, 2019
King is used to dreaming up scary endings, and presumably now King–a well-known Democrat–will put his fortune behind anyone who steps up to primary Jared Golden.

For Golden, he likely would have had a happier ending if he had just done the fully courageous thing….not the politically clever thing.

150,Jeff Van Drew Is Party Switching Himself Into Oblivion,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/jeff-van-drew-is-party-switching-himself-into-oblivion/,"Republicans no doubt are crowing over freshman Rep Jeff Van Drew’s decision to switch political parties, from Democratic to Republican, over his break about Donald Trump’s impeachment.
But, when all is said and done, Van Drew will be left crying over his decision for its perhaps the most foolish that he could have made in his young political career.

That Van Drew opposes impeachment is no secret, but it’s not an issue he had to switch parties over. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is smart enough to know that her members would have to go their own ways on impeachment. Many will support it, but some will oppose it for various reasons, and that’s okay.
But Van Drew has just sent himself into oblivion. For one thing, he’s party-switching himself into the minority. That’s a foolish proposition right there, particularly since with so many Republican retirements this year, no one realistically expects Republicans to retake the majority next year–impeachment or no impeachment.
And, unlike the Senate, members of the House minority have essentially no power to affect policy whatsoever. Members in the minority can make speeches and send press releases. That’s the extent of it.
So Jeff Van Drew has traded the potential to move up the ranks in the majority, for that. All over one vote. Yes, a consequential vote, but a single vote nonetheless.
The last time Congress saw big-time party-switching, it was back in 1995 after the Republicans had taken control over both chambers of Congress for the first time in 40 years. In that case, you had Democrats rushing to become Republicans–but at least it was to remain in the majority.
That made sense, at least in a cravenly political way.
And so far, we’ve only been talking about the remainder of Van Drew’s current term.
Reelection?
Brigid Callahan Harrison, a local political science professor, had already signalled that she would challenge Van Drew in a primary.
She now becomes his natural Democratic opponent next year. And although Van Drew’s district was previously held by a Republican, that was by a single Republican for 20 years.
Without a long-term incumbent, New Jersey’s Second Congressional District reverts back to what it is: a total swing district with a Cook Partisan Voter Index of only R+1.

That means that a Republican has no real advantage here. And now the Democratic voters who put Jeff Van Drew in that seat last year will be highly motivated by betrayal now to take him out of it.

151,Tom Steyer Could Spend His Millions Now Where it Could Make a Real Difference,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/tom-steyer-could-spend-his-millions-now-where-it-could-make-a-real-difference/,"After Donald Trump assumed the presidency in 2017, billionaire Tom Steyer became known across the country for the 30-city town hall-style meetings he put on called “Need to Impeach,” in which the former financier made his case why Trump deserved to be impeached.
He kept the pressure on, even as newly ascendant House Speaker Nancy Pelosi consistently resisted impeachment

In all, Steyer spent $70 million of his own money. And, then, in July Steyer switched gears by stepping away from Need to Impeach, in order to run for the Democratic nomination for president.
However, now Steyer is getting his original wish: the House is on the verge of impeaching Trump on two articles of impeachment and near-certain Republican opposition.
It’s now that House Democrats could use some help from Steyer’s group, Need to Impeach. It still exists, under different leadership.
But where is Steyer and his group now, when instead of playing the role of pressuring Democrats, now they could have the Democrats’ backs.
Steyer and Need to Impeach should be carpet bombing the airwaves right now, putting the political screws to Republicans, making it politically impossible for them to continue their through-the-looking-glass, conspiracy-based defense of Trump.
Steyer and Need to Impeach should be making it impossible for Senate Republicans to do anything but vote to remove him from office.
In working to be a socially responsible billionaire and active Democrat, Steyer has said many things that sound pleasant to our ears.

But now that Democrats have followed through on one of Steyer’s top objectives–namely impeachment–it’s past time for him to put his money where his mouth is.

152,The Nation Must Come to Terms With Its Violent Past With American Indians,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/the-nation-must-come-to-terms-with-its-violent-past-with-american-indians/,"Thanks to House Democrats, particularly Rep Sheila Jackson-Lee and legislation she’s been shepherding this year, the nation has finally begun to have a long-past-due conversation on its history of chattel slavery–particularly how to make that history right for the descendants of slavery through reparations.
However, we have another history we need to make to make right just as much: our deeply shameful past with the nation’s population of American Indians.
First, I suppose I ought to establish my bona fides on this particular topic. I’m married to an enrolled member of a federally recognized tribe who also formerly worked for an agency of the federal government which deals with American Indian concerns.
And, to start with, as my wife would tell you, the generally preferred identifier is “American Indian,” not “Native American.”
There also seems to be a pervasive misunderstanding among many Americans who believe that the nation’s American Indian population receives regular payments from the federal government based on their ethnicity.
That’s false; they don’t. They may receive funds from the tribe to which they belong, but that’s not universal. And the amount certainly is not uniform.
However, what remains of the nation’s indigenous people should receive financial compensation from the federal government. No question.
You are talking about a class of people who unquestionably have been subjected to genocide.
From Andrew Jackson’s Trail of Tears, to Wounded Knee and more, the bloody, deadly history is clear.
Sadly, the legacy of genocide is not only in the past. It’s nearly 2020 and 2 million Americans still don’t have running water. And American Indians are 19 times more likely to be the ones to be without running water.

153,Trump’s ‘Space Force’ Is More Like a Lead Balloon,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trumps-space-force-is-more-like-a-lead-balloon/,"Donald Trump and congressional Democrats actually engaged in a little old-fashioned horse trading: the Democrats win new parental-leave benefits for the federal workforce and Trump wins the new, sixth branch of the US military he’s been dreaming about, Space Force.
That doesn’t mean, however, that creation of the Space Force is a good idea. Because it’s not.

There is a reason why no previous president, Democrat or Republican, has in all the past decades of the Space Age ever pursued creation of a Space Force in the way that Trump has. That is because the current US military structure clearly meets the nation’s defense needs in space.
We as a nation have never before reorganized the military on the whim of the commander-in-chief.
The US Air Force was established in 1947 as part of the broader post-World War II defense reorganization and in recognition that air power had come into its own.
And, then, of course, the Department of Homeland Security was established in response to the horrific events of September 11, 2001.
So what is today’s similar compelling need–the current rationale–for establishing a Space Force now?
Other than that, like a toddler, Donald Trump wants it…and wants it now. Didn’t we hear this one before when it came to the wall he wants along the southern border?
And there are other significant reasons why Trump’s Space Force is a really bad idea, starting with the change that it could lead to an “an arms race in outer space.”
That’s not what our nation should be about, and it’s certainly not what we need.
“If concentrating authority in a Space Force creates an incentive for nations to build space weapons that increase the likelihood of conflict, it would be a profoundly bad idea,” Laura Grego, a senior scientist with Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement published on the watchdog group’s website earlier this year.
“President Trump has called space a new warfighting domain. Space is important to militaries, that’s true, but it is only a small piece of what happens up there” Grego said. “Eighty percent of the nearly 2,000 satellites are civilian, providing critical communications and economic services for humanity’s well-being. We need to take care of space.”
Grego said that when it comes to protecting satellites, “space security cannot be achieved unilaterally or solely through military means. It will require coordination and cooperation with other spacefaring nations. That means diplomacy.”

No doubt Grego is correct.
Which means as welcome as that parental leave will be for the federal workforce at large, perhaps Democrats should have focused their deal instead on rebuilding the State Department.

154,Our Nation Is Off Course Because We’re Looking at the Wrong Heroes,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/our-nation-is-off-course-because-were-looking-at-the-wrong-heroes/,"Mister Rogers and Big Bird, admittedly, are unusual subjects for a political column. However, the recent premiere of the film A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood and the announcement of the death of Carroll Spinney, the puppeteer who for decades gave life to the beloved giant avian Big Bird on the long-running children’s program Sesame Street, makes there no more appropriate time.
For those like me, Mister Rogers and Sesame Street–especially lovable characters like Big Bird–remain indelible touchstones of our childhoods.

They came into our homes and, on a day-by-day basis, used fun, imagination and the stuff of personal connection to try to help us become better people while making sense of the world.
So when when we are reminded of them, and their gentle positive influence, with something like the sweet little gem of a movie like A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, we realize at once in Fred Rogers’ genuinely boundless kindness that we could all be capable of the same, if only we pointed ourselves in that direction.
(And, just a side note: Tom Hanks is masterful in this picture. He disappears into Fred Rogers and you forget that you are watching Tom Hanks; you truly think that you are watching Mister Rogers. Hanks is an artistic treasure.)
But the mistake is ours. Mister Rogers, Big Bird, and all of Big Bird’s friends pointed us toward compassion. We are the ones who chose to turn away to a path of cruelty and divisiveness instead, as embodied by Donald Trump.
I’m not at all talking on a Democrat vs. Republican policy level. I’m not talking about differences on tax policy, abortion, what-have-you.
We can hash out those differences.
What I’m talking about is the needless cruelty of “p*ssy grabbing,” throwing racist taunts at your opponents and just, overall, embracing vulgarity in public life.
President George W Bush was as conservative as they come. He and I probably wouldn’t agree on much. But he was always a gentleman.
And our elected leaders of both parties at one time were somehow able to come together to solve the nation’s problems that today they seemingly cannot.
It’s time that whatever policy we may embrace, we turn back to the role models who we embraced as children.

Wouldn’t that make Big Bird and Mister Rogers proud?

155,House Approval of New Voting Rights Bill Is Clarion Call,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/house-approval-of-new-voting-rights-bill-is-clarion-call/,"The passage of new voting rights legislation in the House Friday should ring out across the country. For two reasons, actually.
One is, of course, it puts the lie to the Republican dishonesty that House Democrats have pursued their impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump to the exclusion of accomplishing any actual legislation.
(But the truth is that the House has approved close to 400 bills to meet a variety of national needs. It has been Republican leader MoscowMitch McConnell in the Senate, who quite disingenuously, has refused to bring them up for consideration. The fact that the Republicans have continued to baldly lie on this fact is shamefully dishonorable but no one can mistake MoscowMitch and his crew as patriotic Americans.)
But the larger importance of Friday’s action is the next big step towards resolving a major voting crisis which has only been getting worse since the Supreme Court struck down a major portion of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act in 2013.
A majority of the high court found that the federal oversight of elections was no longer necessary in nine states, mostly in the South, because of strides made in advancing voting rights since passage of the 1965 law.
However, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that Congress remained free to try to impose federal oversight on states where voting rights were at risk, but must do so based on contemporary data. The measure passed on Friday, officially titled the Voting Rights Advancement Act, is an attempt to do just that.
Voter suppression has become a scourge around the nation in recent years, but nowhere more obvious or pronounced than the 2018 gubinatorial election in Georgia where Democrat Stacey Abrams came within a whisker of winning in the Peach State but for what was fairly obvious suppression where Republican candidate Brian Kemp was allowed control over voter rolls and referee his own election.
Sadly, there is little chance that the Voting Rights Advancement Act will become law in the short term, because true-to-form, MoscowMitch will prevent it from even seeing the light of the Senate floor.
However, this vote should ring clear as a bell that yes, Democrats are hard at work and particularly hard at work at protecting the civil and voting rights who need them most.

156,It Appears To Be Time for Devin Nunes To Switch Seats,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/it-appears-to-be-time-for-devin-nunes-to-switch-seats/,"Disturbing reports have begun to emerge that, as ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes is not merely the chief defender of Donald Trump in the impeachment inquiry that he has portrayed himself to be.
No, rather, this news indicates that Nunes had been right in the middle of the Ukraine scandal, as a player digging up dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, while also helping spread debunked conspiracy theories about them both.

The reports also find Nunes connected to Trump attorney Rudolph Giuliani and Giuliani associate Lev Parnas, who are both under criminal investigation.
All of this raises serious and profoundly disturbing questions about Nunes.
And this is not the first time that Nunes had found himself in a deeply compromised position.
Please recall that at the height of the House Intelligence Committee’s probe into Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election and potential Trump campaign involvement, Nunes–then chairman of the panel, when he should have been a dispassionate investigator–was found to be shuttling over to the White House to brief Trump on the investigation.
It was utterly bizarre and inappropriate behavior then, and this apparent involvement now is even moreso.
As unprecedented and uncomfortable as it may be, it’s time for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif) to compel his colleague Nunes to move from his spot off of the dais and out to the witness table.

Nunes must be sworn in and asked probing questions under oath and get to the truth.

157,"With Her Fundraising, Rep Ocasio-Cortez Raises the Bar",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/with-her-fundraising-rep-ocasio-cortez-raises-the-bar/,"It’s no myth that members of Congress spend a great deal of their time raising campaign funds.
Often, they are meeting with big donors and lobbyists as well as taking time out, as well, to dial for dollars.

So that makes the news from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), the congresswoman Republicans love to hate, all the more extraordinary.
Without dialing for dollars or lobbyist meetings, she raised more money than any other House Democrat in the third quarter, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is known for her fundraising prowess.
While many try to belittle a progressive agenda that centers working people & the public good, in truth it’s more powerful than ever.
I haven’t picked up a phone once this year to dial for dollars, & I don’t meet w/ corp lobbyists.
That is the power of your grassroots support. https://t.co/BDxvMETBnS
— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 27, 2019
In all, the media reported that Ocasio-Cortez raised $1.42 million between July 1 through September 30 for her 2020 reelection campaign.
Not only does this sum send a powerful signal that lawmakers can do their jobs uninterrupted by the pestilence of fundraising, but it also indicates quite clearly that, despite the protestations by Republicans, Ocasio-Cortez’s progressive agenda including her Green New Deal holds great grassroots support.

Rather than continue to be a target of scorn, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is proving to be a role model for colleagues on both sides of the aisle.

158,Don’t Forget — We Still Haven’t Seen Trump’s Tax Returns,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/ethics/dont-forget-we-still-havent-seen-trumps-tax-returns/,"With so much news coming out of the White House on a daily basis, you could be forgiven for forgetting about the issue of President Donald Trump’s tax returns and why they still haven’t been shown to the public. While it might seem like there are other, more pressing issues to be concerned about, the fact that Trump has yet to release his tax returns cannot just slip by us. The following reasons demonstrate this importance.
Trump campaigned on his supposed business smarts, and that was definitely a key factor in how he got elected. However, the facts say otherwise. While being an entrepreneur means dealing with some failures, Trump has a losing streak akin to unlucky folks betting at his failed casinos. With multiple bankruptcies, the failure of things like Trump University, Trump Airlines and Trump Steaks, Trump’s business sense seems a lot more like nonsense. Tax returns can speak for themselves and show that his self-congratulatory attitude was just a lot of hubris. Had he released his tax returns before the 2016 presidential election, it’s likely that being exposed as a fraud would have resulted in him not being elected. With another election in our midst, you can bet he’ll keep wanting to avoid the issue.

Trump’s reluctance to release his tax returns could be about exposing his earnings as being far less than he proclaims them to be and not wanting to be exposed for committing any number of crimes. As president, he’s had many shady deals, such as attempting to have the G7 summit hosted at one of his own resorts. Any forensic accountant should be able to take a closer look and investigate any potential financial crimes. Even someone with a forensic accounting degree should be able to understand how he’s tried to circumvent the law. The wealthy have been able to play by their own rules for far too long, and if Trump is able to complete his run as president without ever being held accountable, it could set a disastrous precedent for what we tolerate in future leaders of this country.
The honesty of President Trump has constantly been called into question as he’ll make statements that completely contradict previous ones with stunning frequency. He has said that he’d release his tax returns in the past, so what’s stopping him? Trump’s not being asked to do something out of the ordinary. The release of tax returns from presidents and presidential nominees has been a tradition for decades because transparency between the American people and their leaders shouldn’t be optional. 

If Trump has nothing to hide, then he has no choice but to release his tax returns. The relative silence that has allowed him to skate by without doing so must be extinguished, or he’ll be proving even further than he’s not fit to serve in the highest office in the land. A president must never be above the law, nor should he or she be allowed to have deception excused. President Trump would love for you to forget about his tax returns and assume that it’s a nonissue. However, the more we press after this issue, the less he’ll be able to hide.

159,"This Thanksgiving, Perhaps It’s Time Again To Be Thankful To Be Americans",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/this-thanksgiving-perhaps-its-time-again-to-be-thankful-to-be-americans/,"When we gather with friends and loved ones for Thanksgiving, as we do every year, we naturally take a few moments to reflect on what we have to be thankful for.
This year, among your other blessings, might I suggest you give thanks for being an American, but also give some deeper thought to what that really means.

What I mean is that, in our current tribalistic and hyper-partisan lives, we have perhaps become too often accustomed to identifying ourselves or our neighbors first as Democrats or Republicans, liberals or conservatives… instead of what unites us first as Americans.
And it may be stressing us out to the point of killing us.
News is out that, once again, American life expectancy is down.
Some see a correlation between this drop in life expectancy and a rise in extreme stress in American life.
“Taken to its extreme conclusion, this shows that Americans exclusively have been subjected to stressful media messages. It’s the end of the world as we know it. Everything you’ve been led to believe is a lie. Be outraged. Evildoers are evildoing in the shadows. Stay vigilant. Remain on alert. Glue yourself to your media device for further instructions. Eat this not that. Declutter your life. Practice mindfulness. And be guilty and stressed out about it when you can’t,” explained one commentator.
Our national division and tribalism would seem to be a key factor feeding this extreme stress and facilitating many of the sorts of messages which drive this high stress.
A second commentator puts it even more directly by saying: “Mostly there is a diminished sense of love among us.”
How much more plainly must it be said?
It is quite appropriate that we take this most American of holidays to reconnect with the truism that we share more in common than in what divides us.

In the process, hopefully we will calm some of this extreme stress which afflicts too many of us.
We have to relearn to disagree without becoming disagreeable.
As we heal our nation, we will ultimately be healing ourselves.

162,"Trump’s Wall: Ineffective, Waste of Money, Hurts the Military",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trumps-folly-ineffective-waste-of-money-hurts-the-military/,"First, Mexico was going to pay for it.
Then when that didn’t work out, Donald Trump forced the longest partial federal government shutdown in US history in an attempt to force Congress to pay for it.
And when that didn’t work, Trump declared a legally and constitutionally dubious “declaration of emergency” in order to make an end-run around Congress’ power of the purse to essentially raid the US military budget to pay for it.

Now Trump has finally gotten his long-desired, but ill-advised, wall started along the southern border of the United States.
And this big, “beautiful” wall that Trump promised would be so effective?
Smugglers have continued moving goods and people through the wall by cutting holes in it with a saw which costs $100.
So much for the wall that Trump promised would be “virtually impenetrable.”
Okay, so this great and wonderful wall, which Trump has put as the centerpiece of his presidency, has been proven ineffective and basically worthless by a relatively cheap tool.
Ineffective: check.
If the wall is ineffective, it logically follows that the wall — which has cost roughly $10 billion — has been a waste of federal money, making the border wall one of the largest boondoggles in history.
Waste of US taxpayer money: check.
And please remember where Trump is getting his funding from. He’s raiding the budgets of the US military, which means that military projects and programs which were set for funding are now going without because of Trump’s foolishness.
“The well-being of American troops is the core responsibility of every commander in the military, yet the commander in chief is shirking that duty so he can advance his own political agenda,” said Sen Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, home of some of the nation’s largest military installations.
So, now in his poor decision-making, Trump proves limp and weak on the military.

Now that he’s had a chance to construct at least part of his long-loved wall, Trump has compiled a record of being ineffective, wasteful in government spending, and weak on the military.

163,"Just How Far Can Yang, His ‘Gang,’ and His Quirky Campaign Carry Him?",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/just-how-far-can-yang-his-gang-and-his-quirky-campaign-carry-him/,"When Andrew Yang began his quest for the presidency, he appeared to be just a Silicon Valley millionaire who seemed more interested in boosting his ideas for universal basic income (UBI) with a steadfast online following known as the “Yang Gang,” than with actually running for president.
Among the crowded field which began the race for the Democratic presidential nomination earlier this year, Yang seemed most aligned with author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, who, too, was making what surely seemed a quixotic run for the White House.

But where Williamson quickly failed to requalify for subsequent Democratic presidential debates, Yang has kept going.
Indeed, Yang has continued to qualify for Democratic debates even while other, more traditional candidates like Julian Castro, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Rep Tulsi Gabbard have faltered.
Yang now is expected to qualify in coming weeks for the next debate, to be held in Los Angeles.
Not only that, but Yang reported having raised $10 million in the third fundraising quarter, more than, among others, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and former candidate Beto O’Rourke.
Against all odds, Yang remains part of the presidential conversation.
So much so that he’s begun to draw comparisons to Donald Trump at this point in the previous presidential election.
The comparisons, however, are not based on temperament, policy, racism, harsh rhetoric or the like.
Rather, simply that at first no one took Trump seriously either, and like Yang today, Trump simply proved the doubters wrong day after day, week after week and month after month, until Trump ultimately found himself sitting in the Oval Office.

Could Yang be on the same trajectory today?

164,"Trump Should Side With Democracy, Not His ‘Friend’ in China",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trump-should-side-with-democracy-not-his-friend-in-china/,"It could be easily forgotten in today’s hyper-partisanship, but in years gone by there were issues upon which Democrats and Republicans could agree.
This was particularly true when it came to promoting democracy and free elections around the world.
So it was a bit of a hopeful glimmer of times past when the House passed by vote of 417 to 1 and the Senate by unanimous consent, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.

The measure aims to support the pro-democracy movement out in force in Hong Kong.
But instead of celebrating a rare bipartisan win for democracy and human rights, we have to lament the lone barrier to this legislation becoming law, and that of course would be the occupant of the Oval Office, Donald Trump.
Regardless of the fact that his fellow Republicans overwhelmingly support the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, Trump has made noises of threatening to veto the bill when it reaches his desk.
And Trump’s rationale is, shall we say, less than compelling.
He would prefer, for one, to sublimate the desire of the denizens of Hong Kong for basic rights and freedom to his ongoing trade war and on-again, off-again trade negotiations with China.
I’m sorry, but the people of Hong Kong deserve better than taking a back seat to Trump’s incompetent economic policymaking.
And, if that wasn’t bad enough, Trump would rather sacrifice the basic freedoms of a people rather than hurt the feelings of his “friend,” China’s autocrat Xi Jingping.
“We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I’m also standing with President Xi [Jinping],” Trump said during a call-in to Fox and Friends. “He’s a friend of mine. He’s an incredible guy. … But I’d like to see them work it out. Okay? We have to see and work it out. But I stand with Hong Kong. I stand with freedom. I stand with all of the things that we want to do, but we also are in the process of making the largest trade deal in history. And if we could do that, that would be great.”
If Xi were as “incredible” as Trump claims, he would be the Chinese Mikhail Gorbachev and usher in a new era of freedom, rights and openness.
But he’s not.
Congress approved the legislation by such lopsided bipartisan majorities that, if Trump were to follow through with his veto threat, lawmakers could easily barrel right over him and approve the measure easily on a veto override.

Not only would that embarrass Trump, it would show once again, how truly out of step he is with real American values.

165,"They Have Momentum, But Democrats Would Be Wise to Put on Another Blockbuster Witness or Two",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/they-have-momentum-but-democrats-would-be-wise-to-put-on-another-blockbuster-witness-or-two/,"A week of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump has concluded, and there can be no doubt that House Democrats have a strong case on which to move forward with impeachment.
On balance, they seem to have the American people on their side.
And yet.
Congressional Republicans seem unmoved. This includes House Republicans who would have an opportunity to vote to impeach Trump, and Senate Republicans who would serve as jurors and potentially decide whether to vote Trump out of office.

Now, let’s be clear: the despite what they may say in public, Republicans recalcitrance is not based on an actual belief in Trump not being guilty of his crimes. Throughout the hearings, not one Republican offered any fact-based exculpatory evidence on Trump’s behalf.
No, it was a lot of political grandstanding and “whataboutism” finger-pointing over to the Bidens and Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company despite not a single allegation of wrongdoing on their part.
I put Donald Trump’s Republican defenders into two camps:
One understands that Trump’s transgressions are serious enough to merit impeachment and removal from office, but these Republicans are too politically cowardly to get in Trump’s crosshairs, risk being the target of Trump’s Twitter ire and potentially pull a Trump-supported opponent in the primary.
The other understands that Trump’s transgressions are serious enough to merit impeachment and removal from office, but these Republicans are too tribalistic and they will flush their oaths of office down the drain in order to put party ahead of country because they are convinced that Democrats are not only political opponents, but actual enemies.
Both camps lack honor and essentially lead to the same result because they fail to live up to the courage of their convictions.
Be that as it may, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been right all along that an impeachment should not be a partisan exercise.
Look, the Republicans may never be movable. That’s understood. However, I think that now that the impeachment train has left the station, I believe that Pelosi and her team owe it to the nation to follow through.

That means that if they can hold up, and find even a few more compelling witnesses to put in front of the American people to move public opinion further in their direction (and therefore pressure Republicans to move off their absolutist, “defend-Trump-at-all-costs” position and consider joining the rational process), the better off we all could be.

166,"My Oops, or Chick Fil A Trying to Have It Both Ways on Bigotry",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/my-oops-or-chick-fil-a-trying-to-have-it-both-ways-on-bigotry/,"Sorry dear readers, you might want to put that Chick Fil A sandwich down after all.
I know what I said just the other day: Chick Fil A making a big announcement that the company would no longer be funding the sorts of rabidly pro-Christian groups anymore which attack pro-choice and LGBT communities.
Just as I was celebrating what had been years of pressure from the left on the fast food chain to drop its support of bigotry, those on the right were expressing their outrage any way that they could, including social media.


Do you think Chick Fil A management stood up on principle for the new enlightened policy that they just barely let escape their lips?
Of course not.
They got all mealy-mouthed, and are now trying to have it both ways:
“No organization will be excluded from future consideration — faith-based or non-faith-based,” Chick-fil-A President and COO Tim Tassopoulos said in a statement to VICE.
I apologize for my enthusiasm in believing that our progressive might could have made a real difference in this case.
But this is about what we can expect from Corporate America.
I suppose if we want social justice in fast food, we will have to settle for the variety served up by the “Chicken McNuggets Robin Hood,” who recently confessed on social media that he consistently dished up extra nuggets in customers’ orders.

167,"Progressives, We May Now Enjoy Chik Fil A Guilt-free",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/progressives-we-may-now-enjoy-chik-fil-a-guilt-free/,"Fellow progressives, the day we’ve dreamed of has finally arrived: you can enjoy the deliciousness that is Chik Fil A the same as all Americans, now guilt-free.
Popeye’s may have recently giving them a run for their money with their chicken sandwich, but Chik fil A’s chicken sandwiches have long put other fast food chicken to shame.
Many a Chik fil A aficionado has half-jokingly wondered what sort of addictive substance they add to the batter that makes their food so alluring.
And the grilled nuggets are not only tasty but a healthier alternative to other fast food nuggets.
And yet like other progressives, I sought to stay away for Chik Fil A’s reported policy of donating to anti-choice and and anti-LGBT causes.

No more.
Chik Fil A announced Monday that had refocused its charitable giving away from such groups.
Apparently, the collective willpower of American progressives has finally paid off. Chick Fil A’s move certainly angered those on the right who approved of the company’s previous stances. And they were quick to point to the progressive boycott as the culprit.
In Aug 2012, I coordinated a national @ChickfilA Appreciation Day after they were being bullied by militant hate groups. Millions showed up. Today, @ChickfilA betrayed loyal customers for $$. I regret believing they would stay true to convictions of founder Truett Cathey. Sad.
— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 18, 2019
I suppose the moral of this story is that if progressives hold on long enough they can have they uphold their values and eat their chicken, too.

168,"Talk Host Gets Boot in Colo: It May Not Be Censorship, but It’s Still a Tragedy",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/talk-host-gets-boot-in-colo-it-may-not-be-censorship-but-its-still-a-tragedy/,"Craig Silverman, a former local prosecutor who hosted a weekly show on 710 KNUS in Denver, Colo., reportedly was in the midst of his program Saturday when suddenly management at the conservative AM talk station burst in, pulled him off the air and went to straight to news programming.
“You’re done,” the program director told Silverman, who was replaying an interview with just-convicted Trump confidant Roger Stone, when he got the boot.
Although KNUS is a conservative talk station, Silverman said that he never hid that he maintained an independent streak, not willing to toe any one party line.
Now, the way that they chose to fire Silverman at all is one matter. (More on that in a moment.) But the way KNUS management chose to part company with their host was just classless and crude. No one is alleging that Silverman was going to put the station in imminent danger with the Federal Communications Commission. They should have let him finish out his day and let that be it.

That said, what occurred was not censorship.
What happened to Silverman reminds me of too much of what I see on social media these days: users who complain that they have been “censored” because some social media platform or another has removed their content because that content violates the platform’s terms-of-service in some way.
Only the government can censor.
Believe it or not, we as Americans do not have a constitutional right to post whatever we want to Facebook or Instagram or YouTube.
Anymore than any of us have a right to demand airtime from Fox News or CNN.
We can post anything we want to social media that is within the terms of service we agreed to when we first signed on. If we don’t like those terms we are free to look elsewhere, or even launch our own website with our content.
Just as Silverman doesn’t have a right to stay on the KNUS airwaves.
However, in this case, just because KNUS management had the right to dismiss Silverman, that doesn’t make it the right call.

Our media should not be such hermetically sealed, tribalistic bubbles as to not tolerate the sort of questioning of Donald Trump that Craig Silverman was engaged in.
That sort of groupthink and strict media control is better suited in a nation led by a dear friend of Trump’s, Kim Jong Un, the nation of North Korea.

169,Can NY Swing District Stomach Stefanik’s Attack Dog Role in Impeachment?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/can-ny-swing-district-stomach-stefaniks-attack-dog-role-in-impeachment/,"Before last week, if you were to mention the name Elise Stefanik, you would in all likelihood be met with a blank stare and a, “Who?” in reply.
What a difference a week makes.
Rep. Stefanik may be a young, junior member of the House Intelligence Committee, but she clearly has embraced her new role as defender of Donald Trump with enthusiasm.
She may be one of the most junior members of the committee, but Stefanik has not been shy this week in mixing it up with committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif) during both of the public impeachment hearings thus far.

Early in Wednesday’s hearing with two State Department officials, Stefanik interrupted Schiff to ask whether Democrats would be “prohibiting witnesses from answering members’ questions as you have in the closed-door depositions.”
Then, Friday, Stefanik tangled with Schiff over being recognized to address the witness, former ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.
These encounters have elevated Stefanik to become the new Republican rock star.
Stefanik makes for an unusual Republican attack dog. When first elected to the House in 2014, Stefanik, then aged 30, became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at the time.
She’s not exactly always fallen into Trump’s line, either. Stefanik voted against the 2017 Republican tax bill, she backed equal rights for LGBT Americans and supported an effort to grant legal status to young undocumented immigrants.
It begs the question how the folks back home in her upstate New York district will take this new look for their young congresswoman.
While, yes, the district did go for Trump in 2016, overall it’s very much a swing district having supported Democrats both for president before that as well as Democrats as their congressional representative before Stefanik.

Democrat Tedra Cobb, who lost to Stefanik in last year’s election but is looking for a rematch next year, definitely wants to make an issue out of Stefanik’s defense of Trump. She used it Friday as a fundraising tool on Twitter Friday.
.@RepStefanik’s partisan political theatre is beneath the dignity of her office. She skipped several important private hearings— now with the cameras on, she has repeatedly attempted to derail the public hearings. Stefanik should take her oath to the Constitution seriously. #NY21
— Tedra Cobb for Congress (@TedraCobb) November 15, 2019
If her bulldog role in defending Trump in impeachment does ultimately cost Stefanik her seat next year, she won’t be the first lawmaker of either party to get caught up in the partisanship of Capitol Hill and have lost touch with the voters back home.

170,"With Yovanovitch, Trump Digs Himself a Deeper Hole",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/with-yovanovitch-trump-digs-himself-a-deeper-hole/,"We already know that Donald Trump’s Republican allies are relying on, alternately, shifting excuses and whackadoodle conspiracy theories which only make sense to the most dedicated viewers of Fox News.
So they already had their work cut out for them Friday morning, as former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch took center stage as sole witness for the second public impeachment inquiry hearing held by the House Intelligence Committee.
Republicans were going to have a hard enough time defending Trump in the face of damning testimony from this poised and respected Foreign Service officer.
Then Trump made the Republicans’ job that much worse by attacking Yovanovitch by tweet in real time, in the midst of her congressional testimony.
Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2019
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif), chairman of the House intelligence panel and leader of the impeachment inquiry, immediately denounced the tweet as “witness intimidation.”
Even former independent counsel Ken Starr, a frequent Trump defender, said the president “was not advised by counsel in deciding to do this tweet. Extraordinarily poor judgment.”

Just as Trump keeps digging his hole, at least some Senate Republicans, preparing for their role in a post-impeachment trial, are floating the idea of a long trial so as to disrupt the Democratic senators running for president.
These Republicans seeking a long trial may realize they’re just too cute as a long trial offers Trump only more time to tweet himself into trouble–and potentially dig a hole Republicans can’t pull him from. In the face of all these damning tweets, even a Republican Senate may ultimately have no choice but to vote to remove him from office.

171,Trump’s Decision Is Clear: Either Admit to Racism or Fire Miller Now,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trumps-decision-is-clear-either-admit-to-racism-or-fire-miller-now/,"As if the impeachment inquiry in Congress wasn’t enough, now one of Donald Trump’s top advisers has been unmasked as unapologetic racist.
Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s hardcore immigration policies, has been identified as an unquestioned racist.
Sadly, outrageously, when Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn) brought Miller’s racism to light, her political adversaries denounced her and labeled her anti-Semitic because Miller is Jewish.
As I said earlier this year: Stephen Miller is a white nationalist.
And now we have the emails to prove it.
This type of racism and hatred has no place in our government.
Miller needs to step down. Now. https://t.co/cvmOXcjAeo
— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) November 12, 2019
Fortunately, Omar was vindicated by the Southern Poverty Law Center release of emails from Miller, proving his deep, sickening racism.
The surfacing of Miller’s now-public racism must force an entire relook at all of Trump’s harsh immigration policies.

But these disclosures compel more than that.
Even as Trump has said and done things that could easily found to be racist, he and his defenders all along have denied that he has ever been personally a racist.
Well, the surfacing of Miller’s emails now offers Trump a chance to put up or shut up.
If Trump truly is not a racist, then he will have no problem denouncing Miller in the harshest possible terms and oust him.
If Trump doesn’t do so, there certainly would be no reason not to see him as racist.

172,"Rather Than Merely Running for President, Is Nikki Haley Auditioning To Be Trump’s New No. 2?",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/rather-than-merely-running-for-president-is-nikki-haley-auditioning-to-be-trumps-new-no-2/,"I hope that we can agree on this much: former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley’s political ambitions didn’t end when she resigned her post last year.
Moreover, those ambitions clearly lead to the presidency for herself, post-Donald Trump.
Finally, that her current circuit through the cable news shows isn’t only, or even primarily, about selling copies of her new book, With All Due Respect.

Long a rising star within the Republican party, Haley is using all of the diplomatic skills she honed representing the United States before the world body to simultaneously explain how she would be different from Trump while all the while defending him from the worst of the attacks against him.
As Haley seems almost too happy to point out in interview after cable interview, 2024 is a lifetime away in politics.
Which makes her current little publicity lap a little curiously timed if considered from a political perspective.
Unless…
Haley, like so many Republicans, truly is just seeking an audience of one: that being the one currently sitting in the Oval Office.
Would it be really beyond the imagination that Haley is perhaps leaving a little bug in Trump’s ear that he would be better served with her at his side as his 2020 running mate?
Let’s be honest: Trump rarely sings the praises of Vice President Mike Pence. He hardly mentions Pence at all. Actually, Trump recently may have tried to throw Pence under the bus in an effort to save himself in the ongoing impeachment inquiry.
By contrast, Trump has never but sung the praises of Haley, who previously served as the 116th governor of South Carolina.
If Trump survives certain impeachment, and heads towards what remains a dicey bid for re-election, he and his team may attempt a maneuver which hasn’t been tried by an incumbent president in more than 40 years: dumping the incumbent vice president in favor of a running mate who is perceived to offer more political benefits.
Trump, after all, suffers a tremendous gender gap, with women more likely than not to reject him as a candidate. Would his campaign team think that Nikki Haley could help close that gap?
Of course, the last time this running mate switcheroo was attempted, Gerald Ford was president. He ditched Vice President Nelson Rockefeller in his 1976 election in favor of a rising Republican at the time named Bob Dole.

Even that gimmick couldn’t save the ticket, and Ford/Dole went down to defeat to Democrats Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale.

173,"No, Mr Bloomberg, We Do Need a Wealth Tax: Too Much Income Inequality Is Bad, Even for the Rich",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/no-mr-bloomberg-we-do-need-a-wealth-tax-too-much-income-inequality-is-bad-even-for-the-rich/,"Perhaps I was a bit too free the other day to ascribe pure motives to former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg in his potential run for president.
Further news reporting has indicated that Bloomberg, unfortunately, may be as eager to defeat the progressive Democrats to his left such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as he is to take down Donald Trump.
The idea being that Bloomberg sees himself as the defender of his billionaire class against the sorts of progressive wealth taxes that Sanders and Warren have proposed, should either be elected.

The truth is that the nation needs some sort of tax on extreme wealth to begin to swing the pendulum back after decades of federal tax cuts which, again and again, have been tilted to benefit mostly the very well-off.
What we have now in the United States is a situation of wealth inequality which isn’t just not good for society as a whole, it’s not even good for the wealthy anymore, either.
Washington Post reporter Christopher Ingraham took a deep dive on this topic last year, finding the nation at levels of income inequality not seen since before World War II (see chart).
“Some of the pain is economic: The studies suggest that the inequality depresses economic growth, leaving less for society to divvy up — regardless of how its members decide to do so. And some of it is social: Studies have found that inequality, particularly the high level seen in the present-day United States, gives rise to criminal behavior,” Ingraham wrote.
“Those effects can take a chunk out of your paycheck, regardless of whether you’re in the bottom 99 percent or the top 1 percent. Leading economists and economic organizations are coming around to the idea that to maximize income and wealth for everyone — including those at the top — there have to be meaningful checks on income and wealth inequality,” he added.
In 2014 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that rising inequality in the United States from 1990 to 2010 shaved about five percentage points off cumulative GDP per capita over the period.
As Ingraham noted, reason for concern here is not only altruistic. Henry Ford famously paid his workers a good wage so that they could afford to buy his automobiles.
Even in countries like ours, not all inequality is harmful, Ingraham noted.
“A report by the International Monetary Fund last year found that inequality could be beneficial to growth at low to moderate levels. On a 0-100 scale known as the Gini coefficient, where 0 means everyone has the same income and 100 means just one individual has it all, inequality spurred growth in countries with index values below 27. Unfortunately for us, our current Gini index value is somewhere around 41, well beyond the threshold where inequality becomes harmful,” he said.
And Ingraham isn’t the only one talking about these issues. The Federal Reserve reported earlier this year that about 40 percent of Americans don’t have the financial wherewithal to handle a financial emergency of $400.

Now, it’s not that nearly half of the nation’s population suddenly became financially stupid or foolish. No. It’s that a very sizable amount of the population no longer has access to that capital, because it was sucked upwards: sort of reverse Robin Hood-style.
This situation is not only not ethical or moral, it’s also not sustainable over the long run.
I honestly can’t see what’s in the hearts of Mike Bloomberg, or those relatively few extreme billionaires like him.
No one is proposing a tax which would financially ruin these folks. It’s just like a generation ago when Republicans warned hysterically that President Bill Clinton’s intended tax increase would “wreck the economy.”
The tax hike passed, and a long period of job growth and prosperity followed.
So unless you have real avarice in your heart, I don’t understand how you cannot be willing to be part of the solution.

174,Facebook Finally Does The Right Thing, This Time Twitter Lets Us Down,The BiPartisan Press,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/facebook-finally-does-the-right-thing-this-time-twitter-lets-us-down/,"Facebook was Ground Zero in the Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election.
The so-called Russian Internet Research Agency paid the social media platform to place what, ultimately, would be thousands of fake political ads so as to disrupt the election and help elect Republican Donald Trump.
That central role it played essentially as a “useful idiot” in Russia’s attack on American democracy leaves Facebook–and CEO Mark Zuckerberg–with much to atone for.

So it came as welcome news that Facebook joined with YouTube to block the distribution over their respective networks of an alleged identity and likeness of the whistleblower in the Ukraine scandal which is at the center of the ongoing impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump.
Facebook said that it is blocking the whistleblower’s name and photo under its policy against “coordinating harm.” YouTube reportedly said something similar.
Their position is in line with major media outlets, which also are shielding the alleged identity of the whistleblower.
It’s simply the right thing to do.
Despite the harsh and dishonest rhetoric coming from Trump and his allies, the whistleblower–any whistleblower–is a potential witness to a crime and should be protected as such while the proper authorities (in this case, Congress) fully investigate the alleged crime.
Which makes it all the more dismaying and disappointing that the other major player in the world of social media–Twitter and its CEO, Jack Dorsey–chose not to make what should have been the right and easy choice to shield the whistleblower.
Certainly, the alleged identity of whistleblower will undoubtedly drive traffic to Dorsey’s service.
But sometimes, the right business decision isn’t about the quick buck.
Even if Dorsey and his Twitter colleagues don’t see the benefit just in being a good corporate citizen, there are other savvy reasons to protect the whistleblower.
He has to be aware of the growing move afoot to have the federal government look at the size and scope of big tech giants like Twitter.

Better to have joined the rest of its industry on this one and not given official Washington any further reason to put the sector under scrutiny.
Except that’s what Jack Dorsey has just chosen to do.

175,What’s the Punchline: How Many Billionaires Can Run for President?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/whats-the-punchline-how-many-billionaires-can-run-for-president/,"Just when you thought that the field of Democratic presidential candidates was shrinking down to a more-manageable size, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg reportedly is ready to jump into the mix.
Nevermind the fact that he first entered City Hall nearly two decades ago as a Republican before eventually becoming an independent.
Bloomberg ostensibly wants to run because he’s decided that the existing Democratic field (read: Joe Biden) isn’t up to defeating Donald Trump after all.

However, with an estimated personal worth north of $50 billion–making him the 9th richest person on the planet–Bloomberg is said not to be pleased with the sort of wealth taxes advocated by the more progressive of the presidential hopefuls, such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
Other than the high confidence that he places in himself to beat his old crosstown rival, whom Bloomberg has always sort of looked down on as a kind of pretender, it’s not clear exactly what unique abilities Bloomberg will bring to the race.
Even as mayor of New York and the easy way he has been able to shift political affiliation and back again, it’s not clear Bloomberg holds much in terms of a political philosophy outside of the fight for gun control which he has publicly supported the last several years.
He’s always been much more of a technocrat. I don’t mean this an insult as much as honest assessment, and that’s that Bloomberg has all of the charisma of canned soup.
That may play in a limited electorate like that in the Big Apple, but it’s not clear what appeal a technocrat would hold out on the hustings, even against Trump.
Then there’s Bloomberg’s age at 77, doesn’t offer much of a differentiator from the ages of either Biden or Sanders.
I have no doubt that Bloomberg’s heart is in the right place. But we already have one do-gooding billionaire in the Democratic primary (see Steyer, Tom). And despite all of the resources Steyer could bring to bear, he hasn’t tapped into front-runner status.

What’s going to be different for Bloomberg?
I suppose we should be thankful that, like Steyer, Bloomberg has the smarts and the humility to run in the Democratic primary and not as a third-party independent, realizing that doing that would only give Trump an easier path to a second term.

176,Trump’s Ukraine Scandal’s Got to be Bad: AG Barr Won’t Even Cover For Him,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/justice/trumps-ukraine-scandals-got-to-be-bad-ag-barr-wont-even-cover-for-him/,"Since the day he walked back into the Justice Department as Donald Trump’s latest attorney general, there almost didn’t seem to be a thing William “Bill” Barr wouldn’t do for the man who sits in the Oval Office.
Whether that meant holding iffy press conferences, releasing questionable summaries of someone else’s investigative report on the president, or accusing the previous administration of “spying” on Trump, there seemed nothing Barr wouldn’t do to abase himself.

More often, he could be more accurately described as acting as Trump’s personal attorney or man Friday than as the nation’s top law enforcement officer.
Barr makes his previous Senate-confirmed predecessor, former attorney general Jeff Sessions, appear to be of Elliot Richardson caliber by comparison.
So while it probably, sadly, shouldn’t be too much news that Trump leaned on his man Barr to come out back in September and announce that Trump broke no laws with his phone call with the leader of Ukraine at the center of the ongoing impeachment inquiry for holding up foreign aid while he sought dirt on domestic political rivals.
The real shocking news is that apparently, this one time, Barr actually did the right thing and turn Trump down.
Of course, Trump is playing the whole Barr rejection story as just more “fake news,” which with Trump means nothing per usual.
However, the unusual Barr snub in this case likely tells us that even he can’t spin Trump’s way out of this. And if Trump ends up being good for this crime, one way or another, Barr clearly doesn’t want to go down with him, either criminally or reputationally.

177,Verdict from Election Night 2019: Trump’s Slow Smothering of GOP Continues,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/verdict-from-election-night-2019-trumps-slow-smothering-of-gop-continues/,"Another off-year election came and went Tuesday, another night that that–although he might not have been on the ballot–it was clear that Donald Trump’s slow strangulation of the Republican party continues apace.
The marquee result of the evening might have come in Kentucky, where Democrat Andy Beshear defeated incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, but the larger and national implications of that victory for Democrats overall appear less clear.
For instance, Trump retains popularity in the Bluegrass State and while Beshear won, so did a new conservative Republican state attorney general seen by many as Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell’s heir apparent.
Where the story of Trump’s inexorable homicide of the Republican party probably can be best told is in all of the state legislative races in Virginia’s suburbs and exurbs on the doorstep of Washington DC.
Republicans dominated many of these seats for decades, enabling them to hold solid majorities in both legislative chambers in Richmond, even as Democrats assumed the governor’s office.
No more. Republicans were finally driven from their majorities Tuesday, enabling Democrats to assume full control for the first time in a generation.
This political swing was fueled by changes in the suburbs, motivated in no small measure by voter disgust in Trump, his policies and behavior.
“I’m not too thrilled with the direction the Republican Party is taking our country,” David Goodwin, 41, a tech salesman who leans Democratic but often crosses party lines, told The Washington Post after voting a straight Democratic ticket in Leesburg.
“What the last national election taught me was party doesn’t necessarily mean a whole lot,” he said. “You’ve got to look at the person.”
Brandy Lloyd, 50, a tech worker, told The Post that she, too, voted a Democratic ticket although she usually supports Republicans. “But seeing what’s happening in Washington, I think it’s time for a change,” she said.
What happened this year in Virginia is merely a further reflection of the phenomenon which fueled the Democratic takeover of the US House of Representatives.
“This is an overwhelming Trump phenomenon,” a gloomy Republican strategist told a Post reporter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment of the party’s plight. “Trump has accelerated everything. There is no path in a swing, suburban district for a Republican — male, female or minority. … It’s not a challenge, it’s a hill. … There’s no strategy to climb it.”
As a direct result of Donald Trump, the Republican party have disappeared from the nation’s suburbs and truly will be solely a regional party of rural America.
That doesn’t sound like much of a growth future, does it?

178,"In ‘The Swamp,’ Influence Peddling Continues Unabated",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/in-the-swamp-influence-peddling-continues-unabated/,"As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump promised to “drain the swamp,” which became a metaphor for cutting the influence of lobbyists and special interests on the federal government.
Of course, like so many of his other promises on the campaign trail, this one was just so much more snake oil.

Influence peddling has only grown rampaciously during the Trump administration.
Indeed, according to a recent report in the publication Quartz, undo influence on government may have now infected the third branch: the Supreme Court.
In and amongst all of the cocktail parties and and rubber-chicken dinners where the lobbying set often ply their trade, the head of the conservative organization National Organization of Marriage (NOMA) tweeted a photo of himself with justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito and boasting of a “great day” at the high court, according to the article.
This bonhomie and coziness is worrisome because NOMA currently has business in front of the court: it has filed against a ruling that Title VII, an anti-discrimination statute, protects gay and transgender people.
Did the head of NOMA improperly influence the justices, even subtly?
The fact is that lobbyists and lobbying represents big business in the nation’s capital.
It gets particularly problematic as former members of Congress and their staff members, when they leave office, frequently immediately trade on their public service for a new and highly lucrative career in lobbying.
Moreover, they often skirt regulations intent to keep them from at least lobbying immediately by using such titles as “strategic adviser.”
These days Democrats known as the “Squad,” make headlines, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, and Ayanna Pressley, of Massachusetts.
But what of the lawmakers they defeated last year, each on her way to office?
We can tell you.
Democrat Joe Crowley, Ocasio-Cortez’s predecessor, now works as a lobbyist for Squire Patton Boggs, a major Washington firm. Likewise Pressley’s predecessor, Democrat Michael Capuano. He’s a lobbyist at Foley & Lardner.
Lest you want only to blame Democrats, Republican Barbara Comstock of Virginia joined Baker Donelson, et al, as a lobbyist, and Republican Carlos Curbello of Florida reports having taken on the Cannibis Trade Federation as a lobbying client.

This is by no means an exhaustive list. It’s just an example of the “revolving door” on Capitol Hill, and the fact that it is a bipartisan problem.
We encourage you to visit Data on Campaign Finance, Super PACs, Industries, and Lobbying to learn more about how big money is corrosive to our politics and government.

179,"In The Shifting Defense of Senate Republicans, We See Trump’s Guilt, Senators’ Lack of Patriotism",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/in-the-shifting-defense-of-senate-republicans-we-see-trumps-guilt-senators-lack-of-patriotism/,"Most rational people, when presented with a crime, told of a suspect and finally shown incontrovertible evidence said suspect committed the crime, they logically conclude that the suspect is guilty and proceed accordingly.
However, when the suspect is Donald Trump and the people hearing the same airtight evidence is a group of Republican senators, rather than do the right thing and arrive at Trump’s guilt, they scamper about in dense legalese and choose instead to try to climb inside Trump’s head (a daring feat in itself) in an a deliberate attempt at obfuscation.
But the truth is that these senators–who very likely will serve as the jury to decide Trump’s fate in office, in relatively short order–have truly had to accept what intellectually honest Americans largely already have. That is that, on a phone call to the leader of Ukraine, Donald Trump tried to strike a baldly illegal deal for release of military aid in exchange for dirt on Trump’s primary US political rival, Democrat Joe Biden and his son Hunter.

The truth is that if Trump were not guilty of this crime, the Senate Republicans–if they chose to abdicate their roles as potentially impartial post-impeachment jurists–and continue on as full-throated Trump apologists, they could and should kept a consistent and unwavering defense. That these senators, including Sen. Ted Cruz, feel compelled to shift the excuses and make up new stories in Trump’s defense simply is proof of his culpability.
Lastly is what the senators’ slipperiness says about themselves. They are willing to stare at high crimes and misdemeanors and simply let their constitutional oaths slip their minds in the name of political expediency.

Unless this group of Republicans changes course quickly, it will make its mark in history as moral cowards and plainly lacking in any form of patriotism.

180,We Need To Face Our Other Global Environmental Catastrophe: Plastic Pollution,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/we-need-to-face-our-other-global-environmental-catastrophe-plastic-pollution/,"Based on our national political dialogue, it would seem as though climate change is the single global environmental catastrophe that we have to face.
And climate change is certainly without doubt an existential threat to the human race.
But it’s not the only one we face. The other is plastic pollution. It’s not only the jars and other food containers we use, but other plastic items of our day-to-day life: toothbrushes, sandals and even synthetic fibers of clothing.

Much of this detritus finds itself on the world’s oceans and clogs the beaches of some of the planet’s most isolated–and beautiful–islands.
A scientific study released earlier this year found a boggling 414 million pieces of plastic just on some remote Australian islands.
And tiny bits of plastic–“microplastics”–are finding their way into food sources and living beings. Scientists aren’t sure what the health effects are yet.
So what is the answer to all this? It’s more complex than you might first think. Yes, of course by now, we all are on the recycling bandwagon. But not all plastic can be recycled.
Here are some tips published by Columbia University:
Be a conscientious consumer when you shop
Clothing: The largest proportion of microplastics in the ocean, 35 percent, comes from synthetic textiles. When you wash clothing made from polyester, acrylic, lycra, spandex, fleece or nylon, between 600,000 and 17.7 million microfibers per wash come loose and end up in the wastewater. Because they are so tiny, water purification filters can’t trap them, so they end up in the food chain. Opt for clothing made of cotton, hemp, wool and other natural fibers instead, and buy used items whenever possible.
Packaging: Choose products packaged in natural materials such as bamboo, corn-starch, potato starch, cocoa bean shells, glass, grass paper, wood, cotton, hemp, algae, lignin or mycelium (mushroom). Try to avoid products in excessive plastic packaging.
Personal care: Don’t buy products that contain microbeads (bits of plastic used as exfoliants). Although Congress passed the Microbead-Free Waters Act in 2015, banning the manufacture and distribution of cosmetics and toothpastes containing plastic microbeads, some of these products are still on store shelves. Beatthemicrobead.org can help you determine which products contain microbeads. And if you must buy personal care items in plastic bottles, opt for larger sizes. Better still, use bar soap instead of body wash or shower gel.
Food: Buy in bulk whenever possible, and when shopping, bring your own reusable containers and shopping bags. Store refrigerated produce in towels or cloth instead of plastic bags. Use glass or steel food containers for leftovers instead of plastic. Cook at home more often!

Visit the Columbia University blog for even more ways to address the problem.

181,Trump Vs. Sessions: An Alabama Battle Royale?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trump-vs-sessions-an-alabama-battle-royale/,"Regular readers of The Bipartisan Press know that we’ve been working with a new artificial intelligence to calculate and characterize the political bias of any given article on the site.
This article today likely will challenge that AI to its limit as to where it might come down.
That’s because, when it comes to a political observer looking at next year’s Alabama election to US Senate, it could appear as a chess game, the picture through a blue/red kaleidoscope or a potential grudge-match in the mud between Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump, which could easily tear at the Republican party in Alabama and possibly beyond.

Former attorney general and Trump punching bag Jeff Sessions reportedly is considering jumping into the race for Senate seat he held for 20 years before giving it up to become the attorney general Trump says he never wanted.
It is said that Trump will be enraged should Sessions make the race, which likely makes it all the more tempting for Sessions, after taking so much flak from Trump, for so long, for doing the right thing and recusing himself from the Robert Mueller-led investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 presidential election.
The fact is in ruby-red Alabama, Trump and Sessions are both beloved political figures and a direct feud between the two could surely test loyalties and friendships.
If Sessions were to regain the seat, certainly much of his agenda would track that of Trump’s. But that doesn’t mean Sessions would make things easy for his old boss. It’s easy to imagine Sessions making Trump beg and grovel here and there just as a little pay back.
However, Sessions wouldn’t be the only Republican candidate interested in the seat. A number of others have already filed for the primary, including well-known child molester Roy Moore, who already narrowly lost last year’s special election to fill the balance of Sessions’ remaining term when he resigned to become attorney general.
While it’s certainly possible most of the other Republicans might clear the field for Sessions, it’s unlikely that the headstrong and controversial Moore would join them.
Which leaves us with the current incumbent, Sen. Doug Jones, the final piece in our chess match, who is also frequently referred to as the most vulnerable Democrat among senators up for reelection in 2020.
As the first Democrat to win statewide in Alabama in decades, Jones is said to have won a once-in-a-lifetime miracle election.
Even as a moderate Democrat in red state Alabama, Jones is in a bit of an impossible political spot, and while I don’t always agree with his positions, I do believe that he is doing his honest best to represent his home state every day.
The fact that he is in a sort of impossible political spot can be freeing in a sense, and I hope that’s what’s happening for the senator.
Which leaves us with the conclusion that as much fun as a Trump/Sessions rematch would be to watch as new soap opera in the nation’s capital, that’s not what Washington DC is there for.
Despite what Trump might believe, it’s not supposed to be a reality show.
Politicians were never supposed to be celebrities first. There is a reason these folks are referred to as public servants.

As a moderate trying to represent his state, Senator Jones is the one who best represents that tradition.
I hope that in the face of people and pundits writing him off in next year’s elections that he once again defies the odds.

182,"The Short, Sad Story of Rep. Katie Hill",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/the-short-sad-story-of-rep-katie-hill/,"Rep. Katie Hill absolutely should have resigned Monday because having an intimate relationship with a member of your campaign staff is just so inappropriate. And Hill knew better and said so.
Before her resignation, Hill suddenly was facing a House ethics investigation.
However, it’s such a shame that it throws away what could have been a promising career for the California Democrat who was elected to Congress as a rising star among the class of first-year members elected last year who flipped the House from Republican to Democratic control.
Hill’s career particularly seemed bright as she won her House seat by defeating a Republican incumbent.

The House will be a poorer place for Hill’s absence, despite the fact that she is absolutely doing the right thing.
But also let’s be equally crystal clear about what’s not acceptable about the scandal that is forcing Hill out.
Hill is California’s first openly bisexual person to be elected to Congress. The sex scandal which ultimately led to Hill’s resignation was first revealed by a right-wing website which reported the details in an extremely salacious manner, referring to the congresswoman’s “2-Yr Throuple Relationship,” as well as publishing nude photos of her.
Hill calls the photos “revenge porn” leaked by her estranged husband, whom she described as abusive. Noting that “revenge porn” is banned in both California and DC, Hill has asked for an investigation.
It is trying to layer this prurient interest on top of what was a legitimate concern about a House member’s inappropriate relationship which is absolutely wrong… and trying to intimate anything about Hill’s bisexuality.
Surprisingly, Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, who usually is stirring up trouble, actually turns out to be one of the good guys on this issue.
“Who among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text? Katie isn’t being investigated by Ethics or maligned because she hurt anyone — it is because she is different,” he wrote on Twitter.
I couldn’t have said it better myself.
It is time to let Hill, her staff and associates move on and heal.

183,Of Course The Trump Al-Baghdadi Situation Room Pic Was Staged,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/of-course-the-trump-al-baghdadi-situation-room-pic-was-staged/,"It had become a defining image of Barack Obama’s presidency: he, Vice President Biden and the senior staff crowded into the White House Situation Room. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s hand raised over her mouth, covering a gasp.
Everyone in that room was intent on the action unfolding a world away, as the president had okayed the US military operation of the largest import in a decade: the takedown of the mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Osama bin Laden.
In the end, the American SEAL team would successfully raid bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan and bin Laden himself would be dead.

So, although might wish it were not so, when Donald Trump had his chance to okay his own spec ops raid on his own high-value terrorist target–in this case, shadowy Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi–Trump couldn’t just leave well enough alone.
Trump couldn’t simply be satisfied with a job well done with the death of al-Baghdadi. Had he done so, he might have been accused of acting, well, presidential. And now, we can’t have that now, can we?
Trump, who is somehow obsessed with the accomplishments of his predecessor, would not be out done. No. Not a little bit.
So Trump distributes his own Situation Room photo. Then comes word from former White House photographer Pete Souza–the man who took the iconic Obama image nearly a decade ago–that Trump actually likely could have staged his Situation Room photo.
Of course he did. It’s the Trump way.
The irony is that how even staged, compared to the Obama pic the Trump photograph by Shealah Craighead just falls flat.
The Trump photo consists entirely of six older white guys–including the president–just sitting there, sort of squinting and trying to look important.
It has none of the drama of the Obama photo, because it has none of the Obama photo’s authenticity.
But that’s maybe part of Trump’s problem right there, lack of authenticity. Even when Trump actually does something ostensibly in service to the nation, such as hunting down a scourge like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, he has to go to find the angle in it that’s there for Trump first.
And that’s why Trump will forever be a small, repulsive creature.

184,"For Mayor Pete’s Presidential Aspirations, It May Well Be Now or Never",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/for-mayor-petes-presidential-aspirations-it-may-well-be-now-or-never/,"Pete Buttigieg has consistently punched above his weight throughout his run for president.
Out on the campaign trail and up on the debate stage, this mayor of small-town South Bend, Ind., has often more than held his own against rivals with substantially more experience in the federal arena.
And in an election cycle thick with Democratic presidential hopefuls, Buttigieg has been rewarded by often finding himself in the second candidate tier–right behind front-runners Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

Of course, as they say, close only is only good enough in horse shoes. And Buttigieg will tell you this is no game.
As summer has turned to fall, debate after debate and public opinion poll after public opinion poll, Mayor Pete has continued to impress but, by and large, has failed to turn that effort into the ability to lay claim as a genuine Tier 1 front-runner alongside Biden, Warren or Sanders.
This, in turn, has begun the whispers which say, “Perhaps now isn’t Mayor Pete’s time. But he’s young. He will have another bite at the apple.”
These are kind–but not necessarily true–words.
Why not? After all, at 37, doesn’t Buttigieg have his entire life ahead of him?
Indeed he does, but that life is not necessarily full and open of future political opportunities. He has already foresworn a try for a third term at South Bend city hall.
As even a moderate progressive who happens to not only be an out gay man but a married out gay man, I’m not certain that many other political doors would be open to him in red-state Indiana in the interim with which Buttigieg could use to stay relevant to the national political conversation, rather than simply recede into the fog of failed presidential candidates.
Frankly, that calculus is prompting me to reevaluate my personal look at which Democrat to support for the nomination. I may well come down to Mayor Pete because he has been overall impressive, punching above his weight while I do readily acknowledge his mistakes and missteps.
In 2008, it seemed to be the moment for Barack Obama–do or die. And it ultimately lent a certain urgency to his insurgent campaign that year against Hillary Clinton.
Perhaps Mayor Pete faces the same forces this year.

185,An Open Letter to Sen. Elizabeth Warren,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/an-open-letter-to-sen-elizabeth-warren/,"Dear Senator Warren, 
If the Texas Democratic primary were held today, you would have my vote. 
I have watched with interest and growing admiration as you’ve worked your tail off on the campaign trail, talking to people, sharing your story, outlining your plans and showing the American people exactly what kind of detail should be communicated about what a candidate for the highest office in the land intends to do with the power we entrust them with.
I cannot recall being more impressed with a political candidate. Your candidacy gives me, and many like me, hope that the next eight years might be entrusted into hands competent to guide this country through the challenges of the next decade. 

For the first time, when you took the debate stage Tuesday as the front runner, I saw you struggle to communicate a point related to your ideas. I’m speaking of course, about what has become the standard attack on your Medicare for all plan. 
The question is how you mean to deliver Medicare for all without raising taxes on the middle class. The reason it’s being asked is so that your opponents can point to your refusal to say whether taxes will have to be raised on the middle class and then call your answer evasive. In all honesty, even those of us with ears can understand why some people think it sounds evasive. 
We do, however, hear what it is you’re trying to say, and I empathize with you since the full answer doesn’t fit neatly into a debate stage soundbite. They know that, of course, it’s the reason they’re attacking that point.

 To many, it sounds like an attempt to avoid revealing a hard truth. I come at this from a different perspective, and I’d like to share that perspective with you. I come at this from the perspective of a man who was firmly opposed to single-payer health care, but one who changed his own mind by doing the math.
 When I hear you saying “I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,” I hear exactly what the math told me.
The problem you run into is that you’ve done the math as well, and in order to do Medicare for all and keep it deficit-neutral, the money is going to have to come from somewhere. Although you intend to get Medicare for all done without burdening the middle class and low-income Americans with more taxes, who knows how the negotiations will play out when you start working on it in 2021?
 What would happen if you committed today that it would be done with no tax increase on the middle class, since that is your intention, and at the finish line, the only way to get it finally done was to add $10 per month to the Medicare deduction in everyone’s paycheck? We know exactly what would happen. The Republicans would start howling about “You get to keep your doctor!”

So let’s look a little more deeply at the story told by your response to these repeated questions. As one of the foremost experts in the United States on consumer bankruptcy, you know medical expenses are far and away the most common cause of consumer bankruptcy in this country. You know that the average American spent $10,345 on health care in 2016 and it’s only gone up since then. None of your Democratic opponents in this race disagree that something has to be done to ease that burden on the American people, especially those living under last year’s $61,372 median income line, as health care expenditures eat through more than 17% of their total income.
But! We are told, The United States can’t afford to pay for health care for all her citizens. The deficit would skyrocket! We would go broke in 10 years! Trillions of dollars! In one of the debates earlier this year, I even heard a Democratic candidate respond to the point that Canada is perfectly able to do it with something to the effect of “But they only have about 30 million to care for while we have hundreds of millions!” Yeah. No kidding. So do the math. 
Let’s start with basic math. What would it take to mirror what Canada is doing?

Canada spends about $242 billion per year on their universal health care system. That money ensures that all 36 million Canadian citizens are covered by health care. This means that the system costs Canada $6,604 per citizen per year.
How much does Canada spend on health care? | CIHI
So what would a similar system cost us?
First, since those figures came directly from the Canadian Government, we have to look at the exchange rate and see what that is in US Dollars. Right now, the exchange rate is .76, so that works out to $5,025 in US dollars.
There are currently 328.5 million US citizens, multiply that out and you arrive at the number. $1.65 trillion per year. Yes. See? I’m not pulling punches here. No one is asking for “free stuff” here, just a realistic examination of the costs. 
There it is. That number they keep trying and trying to terrify us with. It sounds like a lot, doesn’t it? $1.65 T, trillion dollars. Boy, do they love to make it even scarier by naming the 10-year cost, not so subtly forgetting to make it clear that $17 trillion is what it would cost over 10 years, not per year. And of course implying that it’s $1.65 trillion more than we’re already spending, which of course it isn’t. And that last is the thing.
How much more would it cost us to provide Medicare for all than it would to do what we already do?

We’re already spending:
$672 billion on Medicare
$565 billion on Medicaid
and
$79 billion of the VA’s Budget is for Veteran’s Medical Care.
All three of these programs would be rolled into the new system which covers everyone.
SO. The first $1.3 trillion is already covered.
That leaves a little less than $351 billion
It’s clear that your intent is to show the large multinational corporations that since they no longer have to cover the portions of employee premiums many of them do, it makes sense to chip in a bit more to the pot to help get this done. And by raising taxes on big businesses and the wealthiest Americans, that extra could be covered without any extra burden on the middle class. 

But what if, imagine there was no other way to do it but to add a bit to everyone’s Medicare tax? How much would it take to generate? Another easy question to answer. There are right now about 142 million taxpayers in the US. If for some reason people don’t trust that you will find other sources of revenue to make up the difference and want to know how much would be needed, they can do the math as I did. 
Now. What would most people rather do? Pay an average of $10,345 per year, or have an average of $95 per paycheck withdrawn saving them an average of $7,875 per year, putting $656 per month back into their pockets, while understanding that is the most that would possibly be needed to keep the entire thing deficit-neutral, even if you, Senator Warren, can’t find at least some of that money elsewhere?
How would you like that in a nice debate stage nugget? 
“You know, it is my intention to advocate to get Medicare for all done without raising taxes on the middle class. But as you can see from all the plans I’ve laid out, I’m realistic about things, first of all, that the President of the United States is not a dictator. So if, while I’m fighting to get every American covered by this single-payer plan without raising taxes, the only way we can get it through Congress is to ask the average middle-class taxpayer to contribute, you can be absolutely sure that I will not sign that bill if that tax increase does not represent a significant reduction in that average American citizen’s health care costs!”

There’s my two cents, take ‘em or leave em. Once you get it done, come out to the Dallas area, and I’ll use some of my $656 to buy you a Michelob Ultra. You’ll forgive me if I choose a beer with a bit more bite.
Sincerely,
Chris O’Leary
Richardson, Tx.

186,"If ‘Pierre Delecto’ Harms Mitt Romney’s Career, the Voters are Fools",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/if-pierre-delecto-harms-mitt-romneys-career-the-voters-are-fools/,"Donald Trump’s Washington is already a town ablaze with conspiracy theories: QAnon, 4Chan–and of course, the one straight from Trump’s fever dreams which will never die–the “Deep State.”
It’s enough of a noxious stew to keep Matt Damon in low-budget features well into the next decade.
So of course you can imagine the hyperventilation this week when journalist McKay Coppins unmasked the famous face behind a little-known Twitter account.
Just spoke to @MittRomney on the phone, and asked him about Pierre Delecto. His only response: “C’est moi.” Updated my story accordingly: https://t.co/kcfIopokWh
— McKay Coppins (@mckaycoppins) October 21, 2019
Mitt Romney meet Pierre Delecto.
Although “Pierre Delecto,” in reality, was simply a harmless little social media account, reactions trended toward “secret lurker account,” with some users going so far as to ask if this “scandal” would bring down Romney’s career as a US senator from Utah.
Really??
There is absolutely no–zero–evidence that Senator Romney trafficked in anything more salacious than a little political fun with his little alter ego.

When the president of the United States can boast about grabbing women by their genitals and also pay hush money to his porn-star mistress with virtual impunity, the thought that Romney’s “big reveal” should be greeted by anything but a little chuckle strikes one as ridiculous.
Let me be clear: I am not, and would never be, a political supporter of Romney’s.
But that being the case, I can still acknowledge the honor in his public service.
If the voters of Utah were to punish Romney in any way for this Pierre Delecto business, they are fools.

187,Andrew Yang is Different From the Other Democratic Candidates,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/democrats/andrew-yang-is-different-from-the-other-democratic-candidates/,"If you’ve been following the 2020 Democratic candidates, you’ve probably heard of Andrew Yang. An entrepreneur with no previous government experience, Yang has made a big splash with his three main policies: The Freedom Dividend(also known as universal basic income), Medicare for All, and Human-Centered Capitalism.
As it stands, Yang is currently sixth in the latest public polls, garnering 3% of national supporters. He’s also been in the spotlight of several major controversies, with many also claiming his lack of government experience will ultimately drag him down.

But, see, that’s where Andrew Yang stands out. As one of the few candidates with no prior public positions, Andrew Yang is true to himself, not to what will make him look good in the media, or increase his polls. Whether that’s doing a live Q&A on Quora, breaking down over gun control, Yang isn’t afraid to express how he feels publicly, but also logically.
In an era where misinformation and lies are constantly at war with facts, someone who is authentic and genuine publicly is practically unheard of. A POTUS should be a leader and role-model that we look up to. Not someone who spends his time on Twitter calling other people “short” or “Pocahontas.” A leader is someone who can bring people together towards a cause. But part of that is also someone who is true to himself and rational.
As Naresh Vissa, Founder & CEO of Krish Media & Marketing, puts it, “Andrew Yang is not a part of the Democratic political establishment. He is not beholden to any one group or special interest. He is the only Democratic candidate who has actually accomplished noteworthy feats personally. He is logical and speaks with facts – not blind statements or emotions. He is too intelligent and rational for mainstream federal politics.”

“Even though I lean right, I support nearly all of Andrew Yang’s policies, including his libertarian-themed Freedom Dividend. I also support his stance on single-payer health insurance. He has many other random policies on his website and books that I agree with. Most of his policies are common sense and fact-based.”
Larry Cohen, from Andrew Yang SuperPAC Humanity Forward, adds to this, “Andrew Yang resonates with me because he doesn’t sound like a politician. He stands out as a candidate because he speaks honestly about what he sees as our country’s challenges, and offers the kind of bold necessary policies to address them. Finally, I deeply respect the values he’s fighting for: believing in abundance instead of scarcity, putting people first in our society, and finding and respecting the humanity in all of us.”

“He’s bringing together a wide political coalition, from both sides of the aisle. He’s got former Trump supporters, Bernie and Warren supporters, and also many who haven’t voted before or who have been disengaged from politics. His message is about moving forward as a country. He understands and speaks to the real challenges our country faces and is fighting for the bold policies and changes we need. “
Andrew Yang isn’t like Joe Biden, who adopts policies from his ex-running mate Obama in order to gain supporters. Each one of his policies has been thought about and is something Yang truly believes is helpful and logical.
For example, Kristine Thorndyke from TestPrepNerds mentions how, “Andrew Yang specifically mentions the idea of ‘inertia’ in our politics and government, which means that we just continue policies and practices “just because.” He questions policies in the government such as why Supreme Court justices are elected for life and brings forth ideas as to why and how these common practices can be changed to benefit society.”
He doesn’t specifically attempt to cater towards an audience either. While his ideologies generally align with the Democratic Party, he’s usually bipartisan and doesn’t create policies just to appeal to Democrats.

Quite simply put, Yang is authentic. I’m sure you could argue that with some of the other candidates. Elizabeth Warren can be authentic when she’s pushing out her policies. Bernie is authentic when he’s talking about universal healthcare. But can you say either of them have the rationality and open-mindedness of Yang?
In an interview with NBC, Warren called the Trump administration the most corrupt administration of her lifetime. During the debate, Warren also pushed for Trump’s impeachment, saying, “This is about Donald Trump, but, understand, it’s about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.”
Yang also supported the impeachment inquiry. However, Time writes, “Yang was the first candidate to connect the topic of impeachment to broader issues.” He supported “a new vision” and said that “The fact is, Donald Trump, when we’re talking about him, we are losing.”
Yang’s willingness to take a step forward and speak out is something that has become rare.

Honestly, I’m not a big supporter of his policies, but if he’s elected, I have no doubt that some of the integrity of our government will be restored. His lack of experience may ultimately drag him down, but his rationality and authenticity will propel him a ten-fold.

188,"Hillary, Tulsi and Their Bizarre Russian Catfight",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/hillary-tulsi-and-their-bizarre-russian-catfight/,"It began with allegations from 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton against a fellow Democrat running for president this time around of being a “Russian asset.”
They were explosive allegations, given that Clinton was the proven victim of Russian election meddling in 2016.
The finger soon pointed to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii as the so-called Russian asset.

Given the nation’s very real experience with Russian interference in the 2016 election, the potential for a Russian asset to play a destabilizing role this time is not terribly far-fetched.
Yet Clinton has provided absolutely zero evidence to back up her claims.
And for her part, Gabbard’s response has been just as strange. She’s ostensibly running for the Democratic nomination for president. But where does she go to plead her case?
Tucker Carlson’s program on Fox News, whose viewership consists almost entirely of Donald Trump supporters.
Then the question becomes–whether Gabbard is an asset or not, knowingly or not–what purpose is served by this bizarre standoff between these two Democratic women?
Before this blew up, Gabbard’s presidential campaign was headed for the same slide into oblivion that the other also-rans of this cycle have taken.
Now, thanks to Clinton’s bombshell, Gabbard could be, conceivably, resurrected into some conspiracy theory cause celeb third-party candidate for president which could only give Trump a wider avenue toward re-election.
Except was that the Russian plan all along?

189,Speaker Pelosi Should Receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/speaker-pelosi-should-receive-a-presidential-medal-of-freedom-for-standing-up-to-trump/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should go down in history as an American patriot of the highest order.
Not only did she maneuver the House in such a way that its membership took an overwhelmingly bipartisan stand of 354-60 against Donald Trump’s disasterous withdrawal from Syria (which was even criticized by Repubican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as a “grave strategic mistake”), once at the White House for a meeting with Trump, fellow lawmakers and other officials, she had the strength to literally stand up and speak truth to power and call Trump out on once again giving aid and comfort to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
No one has benefited more from Trump’s cowardly and traitorous–there simply isn’t any honest word for it–withdrawal of the United States from Syria, destabilizing the region and leaving our erstwhile allies, the Kurds, open to genocide at the hands of the advancing Turks.

And Trump’s “ceasefire” is little more than still more capitulation to our adversaries in the region.
Of course, Trump’s response to Pelosi’s display of steel in his face was to turn on his toddlerish and puerile insults (which is so obvious his cover that he simply lacks the basic IQ and intelligence to debate policy).
Americans of all political pursuasions owe Speaker Pelosi a deep debt of gratitude to know that someone in authority is still willing to stand up for American interests.
No joke: She deserves a Presidential Medal of Freedom for her leadership. Of course, she will have to wait because she won’t get it from this president.
On the substance of this issue, Trump knows he is a traitor who has sold out the security of his nation.

190,Climate Change Is Always in Season,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/climate-change-is-always-in-season/,"As the temperatures start to dip, and the calendar begins to advance, we begin to hope that we’ve put the worst of hurricane season behind us and severe thunderstorms feel more like a hazy summertime memory.
Whatever time and attention we gave to effects of, and debate around climate change, seem as though they can perhaps recede until next year as we concern ourselves with the winter ahead.
Not true.
Human-generated climate change is an issue year-round.
Folks in the winter recreation industry have already begun to feel its effects.

“Warming has already shifted snowfall patterns around the country. It has made winters hotter, on average, and is shrinking the number of days per year with below-freezing temperatures, which are essential to almost all winter recreation activities,” according to one recent report.
On the flip side of the coin, climate change, once unfortunately referred to as “global warming,” actually can create more-severe winter weather.
And then there is also the study of the effects of climate change on so-called “weather whiplash,” where weather in one place is freezing one day but a balmy 60 degrees Fahrenheit the next.
Of course, we also must look beyond the planet’s colder climes this time of year, where droughts and other harsh conditions may still be possible, and where sea-level rise will continue to pose a significant threat.
No, now is no time to take a vacation on challenge of climate change.

191,"Elijah Cummings: A Tough Investigator in Life, Bipartisan Hero in Death",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/elijah-cummings-a-tough-investigator-in-life-bipartisan-hero-in-death/,"As chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) has been one of the most important point people in Congress heading up the investigations into Donald Trump, leading up to the current impeachment inquiry.
Cummings had become such a formidable investigator that he became the target earlier this year of one of Trump’s vicious, racist tweet attacks.
However, the longtime lawmaker from Maryland’s Seventh Congressional District having passed away early Thursday morning at age 68, Cummings now is being heralded from across the political spectrum.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s remarks are typical of the beautiful condolences and well-wishes pouring out for Cummings, in Congress since 1996: “In the House, Elijah was our North Star. He was a leader of towering character and integrity, whose stirring voice and steadfast values pushed the Congress and country to rise always to a higher purpose. His principled leadership as Chair of the Committee on Oversight and Reform was the perfect testament to his commitment to restoring honesty and honor to government, and leaves a powerful legacy for years to come.”
In death, even Cummings’s nemesis, Donald Trump, chose an unexpected expression of condolence and grace.
My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019
One has to wonder, however, if Trump can manage this level of magnanimity towards a political adversary in death, how much better off we would all be if he could have governed with this spirit of grace toward all on a daily basis.",The BiPartisan Press,Left
192,October Democratic Presidential Debate in Review,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/october-democratic-presidential-debate-in-review/,"Good News: I get a day off work  while all of our high schoolers take the PSAT and can provide you with your Spark Notes updates of how the Democrats are doing.
Bad news: There’s yet again too many candidates on the Democratic debate stage, with more yet to come. The moderators were our best yet in terms of persistently calling out question dodging, but with 12 candidates, even prominent figures at times faded into obscurity. While watching the debate, I’d hear, say, Bernie, speak and think “Oh, I forgot he was even here tonight! Where’s he been?” Is it too much to ask for a higher bar to entry?
The debate environment was spicier this time, with Elizabeth Warren in the hot seat as candidates sought to eliminate her growing lead over Joe Biden and the others in the polls. Here are my continuing thoughts on each of the candidates latest debate performances, again ranked from best to worst for your convenience.

1) Pete Buttigieg
This debate provided a perfect environment for Pete Buttigieg to shine. He isn’t a frontrunner, and the questions tonight didn’t highlight any of his weaknesses. This allowed him to emphasize his unique plans and criticizing other candidates, while insulating him from being attacked himself. Buttigieg this debate was the moderate who said whether to a sideshow like Beto or a top candidate like Elizabeth Warren, “how is this plan actually going to work?” and watched as they squirmed their way through. Now, normally I don’t like candidates who are all critique and no plan, but Pete Buttigieg managed to avoid that pitfall as well. He was critical of other candidates without being obnoxious or personal. He did propose some unique plans of his own, such as his 15-justice Supreme Court plan, and took a strong stand on foreign policy. He also took the ‘is this economically feasible” mantle from Biden by claiming it as a young person’s priority to see some change at least. Nothing but positive words for Pete Buttigieg.
2) Andrew Yang
Well, I think I’m about to eat my hat. I never thought I’d say this, but I’ll give credit where credit is due: Andrew Yang had a great debate. Do I think he’s a serious candidate now? Well, no, but I can understand how it is that Andrew Yang in particular has stuck around in the race where all the other minor candidates and even a major candidate like Kirsten Gillibrand have dropped out. Andrew Yang only mentioned universal basic income (UBI) once tonight, and that was only when directly asked. This debate for him was about being forward thinking, and advancing a fundamentally different perspective than the other candidates. When other candidates want a wealth tax, Yang suggests a value-added tax (VAT). While other candidates debate about Facebook, Yang brings up screen time and its role on mental health. It’s like one of Andrew Yang’s advisors pulled him aside and was like “Hey Andy, people really like your ideas, but they think you can’t shut up about UBI. Can you give them the non-UBI Yang?” Andrew Yang took that advice, and it worked. While he’s still far from being close to any sort of top poller, I think  he’ll stick around, and we may see him in a non-presidential political role sometime soon.
3) Cory Booker
While I’m not sure exactly how to typecast Cory Booker as a candidate, he pleasantly surprised me this time. Of course, we got “I live in an impoverished neighborhood,” but in this debate Booker also stood up for other groups, such as the poor and women, a group he’s not even a representative for. Booker’s early willingness to discuss abortion both as a women’s rights issue and a poverty issue revealed a candidate with a fundamental civility and an ability to transcend identity politics. His comments against simply sniping at frontrunners served him well in a debate where Harris and Warren got into a legitimate argument about something as inconsequential as banning Trump from Twitter. I’m not sure why I would vote Booker over my favorite frontrunner du jour, but he put his crazier ideas on hold this time and allowed people to think of him as a mix of moderate and progressive. I won’t forget my past low scores of Booker (or of Andrew Yang) but in fairness ot both of them, they had good performances. 

4) Amy Klobuchar
Amy Klobuchar is not pleased. We know because she fell back on the meanest of midwestern insults, “Your idea is not the only right one,” and the well known “I’m SOAR-y.” Jokes aside, Amy Klobuchar is kind of the less popular, less progressive version of Pete Buttigieg, but also a person willing to step into a frontrunner role should Biden falter. Klobuchar realized she had a chance because of the Hunter Biden scandal, and so this debate she refused to apologize for her moderate views. The problem, though, is that so many times, Klobuchar would make a strong point and then immediately pivot in an obvious way, losing good ideas and failing to make the impression she could. The worst example was when she was asked about abortion, and was the first candidate to mention codifying Roe v. Wade. She was the first one on the stage to suggest that, and I was impressed….until she messed it up. Rather than emphasize that, she rushed on to criticize Trump, letting other candidates get credit for an idea she suggested first. I like Klobuchar, and I could honestly see myself voting for her, but she has no chance unless Biden falls, and if she wants to stay in, she needs to watch those flubs.
5) Elizabeth Warren
I’ll say it straight up: This was not a good debate for Elizabeth Warren. Warren is an impressive debater, and she managed to convert a center-lefter like me for a while with her inspiring language and perpetual preparedness. This debate, she lost a lot of that luster. Instead of the perfectly composed Warren we’ve come to know and love, we got a Warren who dodged a question about raising taxes over and over again. One dodge might have been fine, but when moderators pressed, Warren wouldn’t commit to a straight answer. This was made worse by Sanders’ frank admission that taxes will go up in his plan. For me, Warren’s whole appeal was her record and her experience. To see her waffle this way was painful. Warren still had her good moments–calling big businesses the umpire as well as the team really resonated–but she took a hit this time. She’s still at Number 5 because outside of healthcare, she did fine, but I don’t have the sort of glowing praise of a Warren debate performance that has become usual in these recaps. 
6) Bernie Sanders
It’s always so hard for me to review Bernie Sanders. I don’t like his style or some of his views, but I still want to avoid bias seeping into my analysis. To me, Sanders was just average this time, a solid Number 6.  There’s nothing new with Sanders, and his debate performances don’t inspire new voters to his side. Do I like that he was honest where Elizabeth Warren was evasive? Sure. Did he convince any voters at all who didn’t want a political revolution that we should have one? Not really. If Bernie’s going to win this cycle, it won’t be by his debating skills. It is a good thing he wasn’t on medical marijuana at the debate though (if there was ever going to be a debate inside joke, there it is). 
7) Julian Castro
I’m not really sure why Julian Castro is running for president. To be honest, I forgot he was even in the debate for most of the run time, and I was taking notes in order to write this article. Warren wants to tackle political corruption, Klobuchar and Buttigieg want to incrementally push liberal policy, Yang wants to bring us into the future, and Castro wants… what?  There’s nothing bad to say about Castro mainly because there’s nothing at all to be said about Castro. I will give him credit where credit is due for being the only candidate to completely destroy the mandatory buyback argument (Mandatory gun buyback means door to door collecting, leaving the door wide open for racist and/or aggressive cops to abuse citizens), and I appreciate his efforts to bring up police brutality in a debate where it was ignored. That’s really all I can say this time, though. Castro was useful in this debate, because someone had to explain how mandatory buybacks would work. He wasn’t really useful for much else. 
8) Joe Biden
This debate should have been in the bag for Joe Biden. I mean, Trump clearly thought he was the best candidate enough that broke the law in order to get political dirt on the guy,. Biden could have played that to his advantage. Instead, he bungled his greatest advantage. When asked about the contradiction between his son’s position in Ukraine and his supposedly neutral vice presidency, he refused to admit any sort of fault. Instead of admitting his son may have acted with poor judgment (as Hunter Biden admitted) but that Trump’s fault dwarfed any action his son could have taken by orders of magnitude, Biden pretty much refused to talk about the scandal at all. This scandal could have cast him as the best candidate to beat Donald Trump. It makes zero sense why he would clam up on it. Worse, Biden continued to make his signature verbal flubs in a debate where his age and health were under intense scrutiny. Sorry, Joe, saying “We’re able to end Roe vs….oops, not that, I mean protect Roe” is not a good look. 


Let’s all take a small break here, before we get to the four worst candidates of the night. These candidates displayed far too many Trump-like similarities to be overlooked, so here we go….
9) Kamala Harris
Like Castro, I had such high hopes for Kamala Harris, and she squandered them. The last few debates, I criticized her for sniping at other candidates while refusing to respond to her own hypocrisy, and thus appearing petty. This debate, the issue she chose to go after Elizabeth Warren on was, weirdly, Trump’s Twitter account. Not to say this is a stupid issue, but, it’s a pretty dumb issue to pick a fight on. I legitimately don’t think a single voter changed their minds about voting for Kamala Harris because she took a strong, principled stand on banning Donald Trump from Twitter. Worse, she repeated her tactic of making strong use of executive orders. This, combined with her support for a mandatory gun buyback achieved through executive order is incredibly Trump-like in the sense that it erodes democratic norms and freedoms in a dangerous way. Using executive power to circumvent Congress, go into people’s houses, and take away their property opens the door for completely unchecked executive power. We are a nation where the president cannot make laws, and certainly should not plan on unilateral lawmaking without Congress. Harris’s willingness to prioritize her priorities over the public and to snipe personally at other candidates recalls Trump in a very unappealing way. 
10) Tom Steyer
Steyer somehow met the threshold for this debate and I’m really not sure how considering how low-profile he’s been in past debates and polls. Well, he’s here now, I guess. He’s not my favorite candidate for one big reason thus far. Tom Steyer loves to talk about how the government has failed, and that’s not what Democrats do. Describing the government as a failed experiment is a Republican talking point, and a pretty standard one at that. If the government has failed, how can one put in new programs or initiatives? Steyer is new on the scene, and I can’t see him getting support when his dominant message is one that basically endorses gutting the government. 
11) Tulsi Gabbard
While we’re on the subject of Republicans in Democrats’ clothing, let’s talk about Tulsi Gabbard. This debate really separated Tulsi from standard Democratic thought, and not in a flattering light. Donald Trump just abandoned the Kurds by supporting Turkey in Syria over Kurdish allies. All the candidates acknowledged this horrible decision, but only Gabbard argued that the United States should abandon the region altogether. Her Trump-style isolationism was thoroughly attacked by Buttigieg, himself a veteran, who reminded Gabbard that she was in effect encouraging ISIS. Unfortunately, foreign policy was not the only area where Gabbard presented herself as a conservative Democrat without the “get it done” appeal of someone like Klobuchar. On abortion, where every other candidate had fresh ideas and was infuriated at the conservative attacks on Roe v. Wade, Gabbard was much more restrained. Her attitude towards abortion seemed to be less focused on preserving the right and more focused on regulating it further, as evidenced by her proposal of banning third trimester abortions and keeping abortions “safe, legal, and rare.” Tulsi Gabbard’s debate last night identified her as far more socially conservative than I think is acceptable this election cycle, and in the current debate environment, it really stood out.
12) Beto O’Rourke
Last but not least is Beto O’Rourke. Last debate, Beto branded himself as “the gun control guy.” I was excited to see him this time outline his policies for gun control and delve deeply into how he would reduce gun violence. Suffice it to say, we did not get that. When asked how mandatory buybacks would work in practice, Beto explained that people would turn in their AR-15s and AK-47s simply because “they follow the law.” Even when pressed that he had no idea who had the guns and no way to collect them other than door to door, Beto simply relied on good faith as a way to enforce a deeply unpopular policy. This sort of inability to discuss political logistics on what has become Beto’s signature policy was astoundingly bad debating, and I wasn’t the only one to see it. Immediately after Beto refused to discuss the logistics of the buyback, Pete Buttigieg criticized Beto for making empty promises. Beto’s response? Using emotional appeals about weapons of war in order to justify a policy he has no clue how to implement. Beto O’Rourke’s handling of his signature issue is a bit of a litmus test for the candidate himself: he’s all promises and emotional appeals with zero concrete policy. That’s why he’s on the bottom of this list. 
We’ll see how the candidates fare  (and who’s still even on the stage) at the next debate in November!

193,What Andrew Yang Sees Which No Other Candidate Seems to Address,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/what-andrew-yang-sees-which-no-other-candidate-seems-to-address/,"You can’t mistake me for one of the so-called “Yang Gang.” I’m not, overall a voter for Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang.
My biggest concern is that he has never served before in elected office. And Yang’s heart may be entirely different than that of the current occupant of the Oval Office. But after our experience with Donald Trump, I think the basic lesson we can learn is that the presidency of the United States should never again be an entry level position.

Despite that, Yang was the only one on stage Tuesday evening at the CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, to lay out some important economic truths.
Known mostly for his proposals to provide all adult Americans with a universal basic income (UBI) of $1,000 per month, Yang has spoken before about the dangers of “automation” to the American workforce.
But to most folks, automation brings to mind things like robots taking over on a manufacturing assembly line.
But Tuesday evening, Yang described automation which is much more insidious, and going right now, all around us. This includes things like that the computerized kiosks at fast food restaurants which are slowly but surely supplanting the number of cashiers available behind the counter.
Or, as Yang explained, the beginnings of the testing of self-driving trucks in California. Not only would this eliminate the jobs of the existing truck drivers, but as Yang pointed out, would also kill those of which who operate truck stops and other aspects of the infrastructure which support them.
Yang’s rivals onstage offered proposals for job guarantees and strengthened labor unions. But if the jobs just aren’t there anymore, thanks to computers, it’s not clear what these guarantees and boosts to organized labor would do to help.
By contrast, the sort of automation and job loss now and into the near future that Yang describes would seem to not only bolster the argument for his UBI, but indeed, $1,000 a month would hardly seem like enough to help Americans get by in this brave new world.

Perhaps we not only should we be giving UBI a longer look, but more consideration of just what an equitable sum might be in a world where the jobs just aren’t to be had anymore.

194,Impeachment Is Neither Seditious Nor a Coup de etat,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/impeachment-is-neither-seditious-nor-a-coup-de-etat/,"It’s time to send Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale back to middle school civics class.
He was hyperventilating Monday, trying to tar the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump as a “seditious conspiracy.”
Parscale is hardly alone.
Other Trump supporters seem to enjoy likening the inquiry to a “coup de etat.”

Only in Trumpworld, with its autocrats and strongmen, do things work like that.
Here in the United States, impeachment is not only fully legal….it is constitutional. This is because impeachment is inscribed in our US Constitution.
Moreover, impeachment–and even removal of Trump–would not constitute disenfranchisement of the results of the 2016 election because should Trump be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate, Vice President Pence would ascend to the presidency. And the voters who chose Trump also chose Pence, specifically to take over in this sort of circumstance.
Parscale, and those of his like, fanning these false and inflamed claims are either moronic, evil to the core, or both.

195,Trump’s Treachery Now Has Americans Fired on in Retreat,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trumps-treachery-now-has-americans-fired-on-in-retreat/,"Donald Trump’s decision to back down in northern Syria now not only has cost our erstwhile allies, the Kurds, in their blood. Now Trump’s cowardice may well result in American blood spilled, as well.
Late news Saturday reports that as a result of the Trump surrender in Syria, Turkish forces have begun firing on US troop placements near the Syrian town of Kobane.
Multiple sources have indicated that the Turkish attack against the Americans was deliberate. It was a specific effort to drive the Americans away from a specific position by the border, as Turkish troops invade Syria.

“This was not a mistake,” said Brett McGurk, a former US envoy in the region.
A fellow member of NATO, Turkey is supposed to be an American ally. However, Trump has shown how easily he can be rolled.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now acting accordingly and it’s a dark day for American prestige and its place in the world indeed.

196,"With Shep Smith Gone, Now The Inmates Will Run the Asylum",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/with-shep-smith-gone-now-the-inmates-will-run-the-asylum/,"After 23 years, Shepard Smith anchored his last newscast and announced his sudden departure from Fox News, effective Friday.
With him goes, really, the last claim that Fox News could honestly make to being “fair and balanced.”
While everyone else at the network seems more or less happy to toe the conservative line, Smith has been willing to be a more independent voice.

Not only has Smith proven willing to challenge Donald Trump’s huge propensity for dishonesty–he called some of Trump’s responses at an early press conference “absolutely crazy–and, egad!, had the temerity to defend rival CNN when Trump attacked it as “fake news.”
“CNN’s reporting was not fake news,” Smith said at the time. “Its journalists follow the same standards to which other news organizations, including Fox News, adhere.”
Moreover, at a time when Trump was falsely telling the nation that the Mueller Report completely exonerated him, Smith encouraged viewers to read the entire report for themselves.
And now, with no real explanation, Smith is gone.
One cannot but think network executives will slide one more Tucker Carlson clone into Shepard’s old time slot, and the pretense of being Fox “News” will finally have come to a final, screeching end.

197,"Trump’s Decision to Abandon Kurds May Not Be Impeachable, But it Helps Make the Case",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trumps-decision-to-abandon-kurds-may-not-be-impeachable-but-it-helps-make-the-case/,"Donald Trump’s move this week to abandon US Kurdish allies in Syria came as a shock to Democrats and Republicans alike.
Even usually strong Trump backers such as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have come out strongly about how this impetuous Trump directive will weaken not only our position in that part of the world, but also cut down our allies and aid our adversaries.
It’s serendipitous that Trump decided to make what amounts to one of the worst foreign policy decisions of his presidency while the House simultaneously is conducting its impeachment inquiry into Trump’s Ukraine whistleblower scandal.

That’s because, while Trump’s move to abandon our friends the Kurds may not be directly impeachable, it will no doubt turn more and more Americans against this commander in chief unbecoming the title.
Americans across the political spectrum recognize that 11,000 Kurds have their given their lives in supporting our common fight against ISIS.
And now Donald Trump has sold them out, plain and simple. That is a political calculus all Americans can easily understand.
No, this decision will not find its way into an article of impeachment. But make no mistake: this is as much a reason Trump should not be president.

198,Trump Shouldn’t Count on Republicans Protecting Him Anymore,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trump-shouldnt-count-on-republicans-protecting-him-anymore/,"The so-called conventional wisdom which held that the nation would turn on congressional Democrats if they dared pull the trigger and begin an impeachment proceeding against Donald Trump no longer appears to be operable–if it was ever valid to begin with.
A new Washington Post poll is out Tuesday, and it’s not good news for Trump. A majority of Americans already support House Democrats beginning their impeachment inquiry against Trump. And, already, at this early stage, nearly half of Americans would endorse the House recommending Trump’s removal from office.
But, as bad as all that is, that’s not the worst of it for Trump.
For all of Trump’s vaunted grand support within the Republican party, and Republicans who will instinctively fall in line for their president, the same poll finds 28 percent of Republicans already backing the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. And, somewhat astoundingly, at this early point, 18 percent of Republicans support removing Trump from office.
If this is where the American people–and even Trump’s Republican base–are now, so early in this process, it’s certainly not going to go in Trump’s direction here on out.
If Trump expects Republican senators to eventually protect him from removal from office he may be deeply disappointed, as–by then–Republican voters back home may be clamoring for something else.

199,The Department of Energy: The Agency Rick Perry Forgot,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/the-department-of-energy-the-agency-rick-perry-forgot/,"Republican Rick Perry became a late-night punchline when while running for president, he proposed eliminating three federal agencies but when asked to name them, he could remember only two.
So it was perhaps a little ironic, or a cosmic joke, when Donald Trump appointed Perry to lead the very Cabinet department he previously choked on recalling: the Department of Energy (DOE).
Perry now reportedly is looking to step down in coming weeks.

When first nominated to the post, Perry reportedly misunderstood DOE’s mission to be about promoting the US petroleum industry.
The truth is that Perry has not been alone in his ignorance: DOE historically has been a very misunderstood federal agency.
DOE’s mission is remarkably broad, and I’ve had the chance to see it firsthand. I’ve spent a number of years covering the department as a news reporter before actually going to work there for a time during the early years of the Obama administration.
But DOE manages everything from the nation’s nuclear weapons arsenal, to grants across the country to help low-income Americans install energy-saving insulation in their homes–and many more things besides.
But the best of the department has to be its network of cutting-edge national laboratories. Some of these labs are fairly famous–think Los Alamos–while several others are much more obscure.
I had the privilege of visiting a number of these labs over the course of my career, and they all are staffed with the best minds taking on big projects in science and technology.
Some of these projects are obvious in their advancement of energy or technology, while others are simply about understanding who we are and our place in the Cosmos.
The national labs have apparently even made a convert out of Rick Perry. Last year, while visiting the SLAC Accelerator in Menlo Park, Calif., he said that working among the talented federal scientists, he said, “is invaluable. You’re making a difference.”

Perhaps there is no higher praise than that.

200,"Losing His Mind on National TV, Sen. Ron Johnson Writes Own Political Obituary",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/losing-his-mind-on-national-tv-sen-ron-johnson-writes-own-political-obituary/,"Republican Ron Johnson hasn’t exactly been a household name since he defeated Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) in 2010. He’s been a fairly low-profile, workaday conservative.
That all changed Sunday, when Johnson lost his mind on national television.
His paranoid meltdown came under questioning from host Chuck Todd on the NBC News program Meet The Press, about the Ukraine scandal engulfing Donald Trump.

Johnson, as a US senator, repudiated both the FBI and CIA and in what was supposed to be a substantive discussion of the scandal began to spread all sorts of debunked right-wing conspiracy theories.
“Why Fox News conspiracy propaganda stuff is popping up on here, I have no idea,” an exasperated Todd noted at one point.
In the end, the only one Johnson hurt by his bizarre appearance was Johnson.
The senator, with his off-the-rails interview, wrote his next Democratic opponent’s campaign ads for him or her. All his opponent has to do is splice Johnson’s Meet The Press appearance into several TV spots, let them speak for themselves and promise the good folks of Wisconsin to be a cooler and calmer voice in Washington DC.
I hope Johnson thinks what he had to say Sunday was worth it. The fact that he is unlikely to be invited back to Meet The Press any time soon is the least of Johnson’s problems.
I believe that he may have written his own political obituary with what was distinctly unsenatorial behavior.

201,The Wynd: No More Allergies?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/sponsored/the-wynd-no-more-allergies/,"This post was promoted for visibility. This does not affect the authenticity or content of the review.
As allergy season starts to arrive, you can’t help but wonder if there’s a simple solution to make your allergies disappear that doesn’t involve pills or staying indoors 24/7.  The Wynd is a portable air purifier that aims to provide clean air on-the-go. Theoretically, that means no itchy eyes, runny noses, or headaches. Here’s how it really performs.
Design
The first thing I noticed when I unpackaged the Wynd was how it looked like something straight from the Apple Store.  By that I mean it was extremely futuristic and sleek. Maybe that’s why it is, indeed, sold at the Apple Store?
Overall, the Wynd is pretty solidly built and designed. On the top of the cylindrical unit is an air outflow vent along with a ring like that shows you the status of the Wynd, or the current air quality if you have that enabled. The top ring rotates, allowing you to manually adjust the airflow.  Below the control mechanism is a surface covered in holes used for air intake. On the left and right sides of the Wynd are dents to attach the included, detachable kickstand to. At the very bottom is a base that houses an air quality sensor and also detaches to allow you to change the filter. The only design complaint I have is that the detachable kickstand isn’t very sturdy and falls down a lot. 
The Wynd is approximately the size of a water bottle and fits perfectly in cup holders for easy transporting.  It, however, does not offer a way to carry it around hands-free, such as a lanyard.
Usage
The selling point of Wynd is that it creates a personal bubble of purified air.  In real-life use, it’s pretty much exactly as they describe. Don’t expect the Wynd to purify your whole room, as it’s really only effective in a small area near you.  At lower settings, the wind output is practically unnoticeable, but so is the sound. At higher settings, though the air does become noticeable, albeit with a much louder whirl.
The Wynd Plus model also comes with a detachable air quality sensor about the size of an eraser. The sensor is meant to connect to your phone via the Wynd app in order to provide air quality readouts.  It also allows “auto mode” where the Wynd automatically adjusts the wind speed based on air quality.
Purification wise, the Wynd does indeed make the air quality better.  The effect is most noticeable when the air is being blown into your face, however, the quality difference can still be felt near the Wynd. Since the air where I’m based doesn’t get to the point where constant purification is needed though, I turned on my stove and fried some food without other ventilation to check the effectiveness in harsher environments.  The air quality sensor remained red throughout the test. However, at max wind speed, the purifier was able to purify most of the smoke near my face. While you probably won’t need to use it as a substitute for a range hood, the Wynd does prove pretty effective in purifying air.
Overall, the Wynd is a solid product that does what it says.  You probably won’t find yourself needing it daily, nor can you expect to purify a whole room, but when you need fresh air on-the-go, the Wynd will more than suffice.  It’s a definite buy especially if you need allergy relief while working or commuting. At $129 for the version with no air quality sensor and $199 for the one with, it doesn’t come cheap. Ultimately though, it’s worth the portability and effectiveness that it brings for the people suffer from environment pollution or moderate allergies.
Suffer from Allergies? Check out the Wynd!

202,"Chairman Schiff, Stick to the Truth",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/chairman-schiff-stick-to-the-truth/,"It was just a few days ago in this very space that we gave House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif) an endorsement to lead the burgeoning impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump.
That endorsement was based on Schiff’s proven record, particularly in the Trump years, of prosecutorial seriousness rather than partisan hyperventilation.
So to say that we were shocked and more than a little disappointed when The Washington Post‘s impeccable Fact Checker awarded Schiff the particularly dubious distinction of it’s worst designation of dishonesty, the Four Pinocchios.

Those are the sorts of lows which we have come to expect from Trump and those around him.
But Democrats must not–never–emulate the Trump team’s habit for dissembling and dishonesty.
If anything, Democrats must stand for–and insist upon–the exact opposite.
If Democrats become known among the American people for the same sort of dishonesty and lying which Trump is known for, then why shouldn’t they just continue choosing Trump and his brand of lies?
Democrats must be known for better.
No. Chairman Schiff made a grievous mistake, one for which he should atone. And one that he–and no other Democrat– should ever repeat.

203,Impeaching Trump Might Be The GOP’s Best Move,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/impeaching-trump-might-be-the-gops-best-move/,"Although conventional wisdom in Washington seems to suggest that the House will impeach Donald Trump while the Republican-led Senate will vote to acquit, in reality, I think it’s in the Republican’s best interests to impeach him in the House and then convict him in the Senate. Hear me out on this.
First off, we’ve got the obvious issue of being tainted by association. Trump’s provably corrupt, if not provably insane (particularly judging by the more and more crazed rants that we’re seeing on Twitter, following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s announcement), and the continuing support of the Republican Party behind him is simply painting them with the same brush: they have enabled him, backed him, defended him, even when it’s pretty clear that such reasoning as is provided is both weak and not really likely to stand up to scrutiny.

Realistically, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) have more important things to do than worry about Trump: McCarthy has to attempt to retake the House, and McConnell needs to preserve that razor-thin majority in the Senate — particularly bearing in mind that the Republicans will be defending 23 Senate seats to the 12 seats being defended by the Democrats. That could be quite the uphill battle, but even moreso if Trump’s corruption (and the taint by association) is hanging around the necks of the Republican Party.
More than that, do note that the primaries are in progress. Although several states (South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona and Kansas) are likely not to hold primaries while Trump remains the incumbent, that could change if Trump is impeached by the current Congress. This might be their best option, electorally: although Trump has a lock on the current Republican base, he has next to no support among Democrats or Independents — which means at best, he might be able to swing 23 to 24 percent of the main electoral vote in 2020. That won’t be enough to hold onto the White House, particularly if we see the same sort of turnout as was observed during the 2018 midterm elections.
A different Republican candidate, particularly one disavowing Trump and pledging to return the United States to some semblance of normalcy, while still speaking to the Republican base’s issues…they might get more traction, particularly if the Trump smear machine does another number on the Democratic nominee between now and then.

Furthermore, we’ve still got just over 13 months to go until the next presidential election. If impeachment proceedings move quickly, the Republicans might well be better served with President Pence than by President Trump. Although he’s well known as a “Christian Dominionist” and unlikely to garner high levels of support in a presidential election, he’s much more politically savvy and far less emotionally erratic than Trump — so getting shot of the top of the ticket gives the GOP opportunity to distance themselves from the Trump administration and still have a president in the Oval Office that is sympathetic to their agenda, and might help push things along in that direction.
It similarly gives the Republicans chance to “re-invent” themselves. Though nothing would actually change within their ranks, they could wage a PR campaign observing that Trump was offering change that they hoped for, but in reality contributed to the swamp rather than drained it. Thus, at the end, they did the honourable thing and removed him from office, allowing them to begin the slow and laborious process of improving the Republican Party…with a view to doing x, y and z if you vote for them in 2020 — in other words, they wash their hands clean, and go back to doing what they always do.

I should also note that such an action would give the GOP claim to bipartisan co-operation: “Look, we came together with the Democrats in service of our country, to remove a cancer at the heart of our government. We did this in patriotic spirit, recognising that our country is bigger than one man, and that nobody can be allowed to act in such a fashion while representing the United States.”
Wanna bet that wouldn’t score them some serious points with Independents?
Trump is now a gigantic liability for the Republican Party, and maintaining a defense of a damaged president may be the way that pushes their party into collapse. Getting rid of him via the opening of impeachment may well be the best strategic move they could possibly make at this junction.

Thus, the Democrats absolutely need to keep these impeachment hearings going as long as possible — not only to dig up every single iota of dirt that the president has been hiding, but also to ensure that the GOP don’t have time to right the ship before the 2020 elections. They nominated him, endorsed him, supported him and enabled him throughout everything he’s done: he is reflective of the entire Republican Party now. They cannot be allowed to kick him out of office and act as though it was a mistake, and that they have now seen the light.

204,"Sanders Recovering After Heart Surgery. Can The Same Be Said for His, Biden’s Campaigns?",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/sanders-recovering-after-heart-surgery-can-the-same-be-said-for-his-bidens-campaigns/,"Sen. Bernie Sanders reportedly is recovering and resting, following heart surgery in which stents were implanted to correct an arterial blockage.
As with people of good faith, of any political persuasion should, we wish Senator Sanders only the speediest and most successful of recoveries.
However, we also cannot help but think that this episode will intensify the questions and doubts that will arise from Sanders–and fellow Democrat Joe Biden, both in their late ’70s–as they continue to run for president.
For those old enough to remember, it recalls the headlines back in the 1980s, when as the oldest president ever to serve to that point–Ronald Reagan–would be taken to the hospital to have polyps removed and the American people waited to hear whether the president had developed cancer.

Of course, Reagan never did, and it was later Alzheimer’s Disease which he had to battle in the end.
But now we have Sanders or Biden, who if elected, would serve into his ’80s–and if fortunate to be re-elected–well into his mid ’80s.
Now, a stent implantation isn’t, in itself, the end of the world. But it is just one more reminder of the mortality of these older candidates.
Reagan waved away concern over his advanced age by making a joke of it in the midst of a presidential debate on his way to re-election.
It’s not clear quite the same thing would work for Biden and Sanders. But both men potentially face nagging questions over their health related to their advanced ages.
And both would be well advised to finally take the issue on, in a head-on and forthright way which could satisfy the majority of American voters.
It’s not immediately clear what that would look like, but unless both men put these issues behind them once and for all, they will be hobbled by them.

205,Amping Up Attacks Against Whistleblower May Add Impeachment Charges,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/amping-up-attacks-against-whistleblower-may-add-impeachment-charges/,"Donald Trump has embarked on a scorched Earth defense against the whistleblower in the intelligence community at the center of the scandal pushing Trump toward impeachment.
However, by employing the bellicose rhetoric and a variety of threats against the unnamed whistleblower, Trump very well may be making his impeachment more–not less–certain.
In recent days, Trump has demanded that the whistleblower to be unmasked, suggested that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) should be arrested for treason and amplified the comment of a supporter who said impeachment could create a “Civil War like fracture” in the United States.

(House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has designated Schiff to lead the burgeoning impeachment inquiry.)
However, Trump’s rhetoric betrays the oath of office he took and, therefore, could simply add to the number of articles of impeachment he may ultimately face, according to Washington Post columnist and noted Trump critic Max Boot.
“I mean not just the obstruction but also the threats that the president is now issuing against the whistleblower, saying that he’s a spy and suggesting that he should get the death penalty, saying that he’s interested in learning the whistleblower’s identity,” Boot said. “I mean remember the president has a duty under the Constitution to take care that the law is being faithfully executed, and one of those laws is the whistleblower protection act, which clearly Trump is not enforcing, in fact just the very opposite. So, you know, these threats of violence, of civil war, of treason, of execution, I think all of that could be added to the articles of impeachment along with the ongoing obstruction of justice and the obstruction of Congress. I think those are also major articles.”
Once again, Trump’s mouth may get him into the most trouble of all.

206,Lawrence O’Donnell’s Alternate Impeachment Theory: Republican Leader Ready to Ditch Trump in 2020,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/lawrence-odonnells-alternate-impeachment-theory-republican-leader-ready-to-ditch-trump-in-2020/,"Donald Trump and his friends on the Right regularly traffic in so many wild conspiracy theories. So forgive us over here on the other side what might be one single one.
It comes from MSNBC host and former Senate staffer Lawrence O’Donnell, who recently posited a uniquely Machiavellian reason for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) acquiescing to the release of the whistleblower complaint at the center of the scandal which has finally triggered an impeachment inquiry against Trump.
To hear O’Donnell tell it, McConnell knew that the complaint would come out eventually–it was just a matter of timing.

“McConnell is looking at that saying, ‘Do I want them to get it a year from now, in September, when I am locked into a nominee for president? Or do I wanna get this as soon as possible to find out what the weight of it is while we still have time to change nominees? That’s my alternative theory,” O’Donnell explained.
When you stop to think about it–really think about it–it makes a certain amount of sense.
We know that Trump’s sense of loyalty is entirely one-sided: toward him. Why wouldn’t his Republican allies respond in kind?
Defend Trump when it suits them, but when he becomes too much of a liability, why shouldn’t the Republicans be just as quick to throw Trump under the bus and move on to the next, better model?
After all, isn’t that just the Trump way?

207,Chairman Adam Schiff: The New Face of the Trump Impeachment,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/chairman-adam-schiff-the-new-face-of-the-trump-impeachment/,"The Washington Post is reporting that moderate House Democrats who are skittish as to what effect impeachment of Donald Trump might have on their political fortunes in next year’s elections have successfully asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi to assign Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif) as the prevailing face of Trump’s impeachment.
This will take the immediate leadership out of the hands of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and put it in the hands of the chairman of House Intelligence Committee.
This is no knock on Nadler or his Judiciary Committee, per se.
However, since the earliest days of the Trump administration, even through the early years in the minority, Schiff developed a reputation less as a liberal partisan and more a level-headed investigator.
Schiff doggedly followed the Russian interference into the 2016 election, even as the chairman of House Intelligence at the time, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif), was more interested in working as a political ally for Trump.
Schiff has been a favorite interview on the cable news networks, specifically because he speaks so seriously on these subjects.
And Trump is very aware of Schiff, needling the lawmaker on Twitter with the moniker “Little Adam Schiff.”
But while other Trump opponents might be easily dismissed as angry partisans, not the 59-year-old Schiff.
He has the mien befitting someone who served a stint as a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles before winning his House seat in 2000.
Perhaps one of Schiff’s colleagues on House Intelligence said it best: “There’s no better guy on the face of the planet to undertake this in an adultlike, intelligent, integrity-filled manner than Adam B. Schiff. Period, full stop,” said Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.).

208,Impeachment: Trump in Trouble as GOP Cracks Begin to Form,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/impeachment-trump-in-trouble-as-gop-cracks-begin-to-form/,"At this point, you can take your pick as why Donald Trump is in sinking trouble over his Ukraine whistleblower scandal.
You could choose, as some say, that Trump has lost control of the narrative, which is not a good position to be in, headed into impeachment.
Or you could choose what ought to be an alarming fact that cracks have begun to form in Trump’s Republican wall of defense.
Yes, to be sure, these cracks today are small, and some could argue, inconsequential.
But these small cracks have emerged quickly nonetheless–within just a couple of weeks of the entire scandal breaking into public view.
Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) came out in favor of an impeachment inquiry. (Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan came out for impeachment earlier, but Amash ultimately left the GOP and became an independent.)
Meanwhile, on the Senate side, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has already spoken out against Trump’s dealings with the leader of Ukraine at the center of the impeachment drive.
While, yes, you can certainly argue Romney has maintained a reputation as a strong Trump critic, again it’s the timing. If Romney jumped this soon, what might force the hands of other GOP senators down the road?
Which brings us to this report just out, in which GOP strategist Mike Murphy says an unnamed Republican senator told him 30 Republican senators would vote to remove Trump from office today if it were on a secret ballot.
Of course, any final vote to remove Trump or not will not be secret.
But what today is possible by secret ballot today could well happen out in the open in the future.

209,Inside the Democrat’s Case for Trump’s Impeachment,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/positioning-for-impeachment/,"With House Speaker Nancy Pelosi having declared that Congress will now open up impeachment proceedings against President Trump, the question now must be raised: what path will the Democrats take in building their case against him? Can they develop a sufficiently-convincing picture of a corrupt, dangerous president that ultimately stands as unfit for office?
The “smoking gun” that has prompted Pelosi to take action is the reports of an inappropriate conversation conducted between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. In that conversation, Trump actively requested that Ukraine work with the US Attorney-General to dig up information regarding Joe Biden and his son Hunter, implying that there was impropriety in their dealings in Ukraine. Critics have taken this as an act of coercion against the Ukrainian government: Trump had frozen military aid to Ukraine that would assist in their conflict with Russian-armed insurgents that aim to effectively annex the former Soviet state, prior to his conversation with President Zelensky. This is therefore being considered a “shakedown” of sorts: if Ukraine would help to dig up dirt against Biden, Trump would release the funds.
This would likely be a violation of the Hobbs Act, which forbids political officials from extorting others for personal gain through acts required of their office. Barbara McQuade of The Daily Beast makes this point rather clearly:
“The federal bribery statute makes it a crime for a public official to demand anything of value in exchange for performing an official act. A statute known as the Hobbs Act defines extortion as obtaining property from another, with his consent, under color of official right. “Property” is defined to mean anything of value, tangible or intangible. The essence of both crimes is a demand by a public official to obtain something for himself to which he is not entitled in exchange for performing an official act of his office.”
Barbara McQuade, The Daily Beast: “If Whistleblower Is Right, Trump May Have Committed Extortion And Bribery”.
This is obviously not the first time that Trump has been implicated in a Federal crime: his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, implicated him as an unindicted co-conspirator in violating Federal campaign finance laws, while Robert Mueller’s report not only detailed multiple instances in which members of the Trump Campaign openly lied, but also made a compelling case that suggested that Trump may have actively sought to obstruct justice. Trump’s sole protection against criminal prosecution, at present, stems from a memo issued by the Department of Justice during the Nixon affair, in which they stated that a sitting President could not be indicted. Mueller was clear about this during his statement, observing that:
“And as set forth in the report after that investigation, if we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.
We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime. The introduction to the volume two of our report explains that decision. It explains that under long-standing Department policy, a President cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that too is prohibited. The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that Department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.”
Robert Mueller, Press Conference, 29th May 2019: Full Transcript
There has also been considerable speculation as to whether the President has violated the Emoluments Clause (Article I, Section 9 of the United States Constitution) whilst in office, particularly given that this specific clause is designed to protect the United States against a President who might be subject to foreign influence as a result of being financially beholden to foreign interests. If Trump has been personally profiting from his Presidency, that in itself would be a violation: his proposal to hold next year’s G7 summit at his golf course at Doral, Miami would be a perfect example of this: ultimately, the Federal Government (and therefore the taxpayer) would have to foot the bill for security upgrades and all expenditures relating to the summit – this would ultimately end up in Trump’s pocket.

We have little reason to doubt that the Democrats will be pursuing all of these avenues during the process of impeachment: their objective now will be to lay out all the evidence that the six separate committees can gather, and make their case for the clear unsuitability of the President to hold high Federal office. It’s fair to suggest that Trump, perhaps more than any President since Nixon, has given Congress reason to consider their most serious act of political rebuke: his casual relationship to the truth, his divisive attitude towards his fellow Americans, his controversial “America First” approach to foreign policy (which has clearly damaged the reputation of the United States abroad, and undermined any moral authority and leadership it may once have been able to claim), and his obstructive actions with regards to Congressional oversight of the Executive Branch have all but handed the Democrats a mandate to hold him accountable.
Although the Democrats have been hesitant to take the step of moving towards impeachment proceedings up until now, it could well be argued that this is precisely what the electorate wanted: a Congress that would hold the president responsible for his conduct in office. Had they been satisfied with the country’s direction, would we not have seen the previous Republican majority maintained in the House?
Of course, the risk for the Democratic Party is significant here: Trump will naturally spin their move to impeach him as “anti-American” and “un-democratic,” having already declared their concerns with regards to the Ukraine phonecall to be “Witch Hunt garbage.” Although it seems likely that the Democrats will indeed be able to successfully impeach Trump (since this requires only a simple majority (218 votes out of the 435 representatives — the Democrats control 235 seats), the invariable question is whether the Republican-controlled Senate will vote to convict Trump once Articles of Impeachment have passed the House. Should they acquit Trump, that could very easily be spun as complete exoneration, and perhaps undermine Democratic Party efforts to unseat Trump, catapulting him into a second term in the Oval Office.
The stakes are certainly high here, so one thing is abundantly clear: the House needs to develop a water-tight case against Trump to provide the best chance of removing him from office. They certainly have a lot of things they can potentially work with, however, so those feeling dismal about the Democrat’s chances in this respect should take time to consider the preponderance of evidence already available to the public.
That the Democrats have a strong case to make is clear enough. The inevitable question is whether that case will be sufficient to convince a politically-charged and highly-divided electorate that the President is unfit for office, serving his own interests above their own.

210,Impeachment: Now Democrats Must Build Their Case,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/impeachment-now-democrats-must-build-their-case/,"After months of resisting pleas from her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally Wednesday announced a formal impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. You could practically hear the Hallelujah Chorus coming off Capitol Hill.
But this isn’t the end. It’s just the beginning. For Democrats, the hard work is only just starting.
And as much enthusiasm for impeachment is gathering among congressional Democrats, they still have to spread that zeal across the country. Only a minority of Americans today support removing Trump from office.

This is the wisdom of starting off with an impeachment inquiry rather than move directly to voting on articles of impeachment.
The inquiry will provide House Democrats an opportunity to both build and lay out a compelling case against Trump. The idea will be to increase the percentage of Americans desiring to remove Trump.
This is particularly important once you cast eyes on the Senate, where Republicans have consistently provided Trump virtually unlimited political cover.
There is no way today that the Senate would remove Trump from office. However, perhaps as next year’s elections draw closer, a damning case against Trump could change the political calculus in the Senate.
Whether Majority Leader Mitch McConnell chooses to acknowledge the fact publicly or not, he will have politically vulnerable senators of one sort or another who now will have to take a stand on Trump’s guilt.

211,Republicans: It’s Time To Put Your Damn Country Over Your Damn Party,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/republicans-its-time-to-put-your-damn-country-over-your-damn-party/,"An ever-growing number of House Democrats, including increasingly those in pro-Trump districts, are coming out for Donald Trump’s impeachment.
One of those is freshman Rep. Haley Stevens, who won in a district carried by Trump. Stevens is just out with this statement: “Over the last several days, I have been deeply alarmed by reports of serious abuse of power by President Trump.
“The President is alleged to have used the power of his office to pressure a foreign head of state for his own personal political gain. Furthermore, the Director of National Intelligence continues to illegally withhold information about this matter from Congress. If investigations confirm recent reports, these actions represent impeachable offences that threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections and jeopardize the balance of power within the federal government.”
Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has tamped down any serious move towards impeachment, reportedly now is sounding out colleagues that now might be the time.

That, of course, leaves Republicans. Only Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan stepped up and endorsed Trump’s impeachment. And in the end, Amash left the Republican Party to become an independent.
The silence–indeed, the political cover– that congressional Republicans have provided for Trump’s countless crimes and misdeeds is precisely what led some like Pelosi up until now to see the fruitlessness of pursuing anything like impeachment.
However, other Republicans, such as noted anti-Trump commentator Ana Navarro, are urging their colleagues finally to step up and do the right thing.
“What I am going to do is implore with Republicans, elected Republicans particularly in the Senate, to for once during this administration put your damn country over your damn party,” she said. “You know, we’re talking about the Ukraine. This is — this is a country where Republicans invested so much. I remember all the times that John McCain went there. There’s a street named for him because the U.S. was with the Ukrainian people, against the invasion of Russia and Crimea because the U.S. was such an integral part of wanting to build a democracy and a strong government in Ukraine. So now for Republicans to look the other way and play dumb is absolutely grotesque.”
Yes, Republicans, put your damned country ahead of your damned party indeed.

212,Whistleblower Scandal: Pence May Join Trump In the Bullseye,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/whistleblower-scandal-pence-may-join-trump-in-the-bullseye/,"Almost since it broke just days ago, the White House whistleblower scandal–in which Donald Trump may well have withheld military aid from Ukraine in an attempt to pressure that country’s leader to dig dirt on Democrat Joe Biden–has felt at least qualitatively different than the myriad Trump scandals which came before.
Perhaps it is that this one has mushroomed so quickly. Maybe it’s that this time it involves a foreign power led by someone not tied to Trump’s hip.

And it may mark a darker turn for this administration because–up until now–Vice President Pence has kept his name distantly away from any of the past serious misdeeds, including Russia interference and the related obstruction of justice.
Let us be very clear and say we are far from making any definitive statements. But news reporting has begun to indicate that Pence may have had knowledge of, if not direct involvement in, the campaign to hold up aid for Ukraine as a stick to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to smear former vice president Joe Biden, who has consistently bested Trump in public opinion trial heats ahead of next year’s US presidential election.
A variety of lawmakers and others have agreed that if facts are borne out, the whistleblower scandal–so named because it was brought to light by a whistleblower in the US intelligence community–could finally push Congress into impeaching Trump.
And now if it is indeed proven that Pence also holds culpability, the United States could well be in for a constitutional and presidential crisis not seen since Watergate–indeed, one which could easily dwarf Watergate.

213,The Real Reason Behind Russia’s Struggling Economy,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/foreign-policy/the-real-reason-behind-russias-struggling-economy/,"What do you imagine when you think of Russia?
Nuclear weapons? Expansive palaces? An arms race?
Russia is one of the main world powers in the world today. They have masses of oil and the second most powerful military on the planet. However, most people are surprised to learn that the average Russian makes around $8000 a year, around seven times less than the average American. Almost all of this, and more could all be boiled down to one single reason. 

Many people would pin the blame on the government of Russia, that squanders the natural wealth of the nation at the peasant’s dime. However, the main reason for Russia’s poverty is its geography. They simply don’t have the things that foster a middle class, such as rivers for domestic trade, and ports for international trade. 
Since they do not have a good river system like the United States, they will never be able to completely trade within the entirety of their country, especially given how simply massive Russia is. Russian ports are either frozen for most of the year or controlled by NATO nations. This means that port cities, based off exporting Russian goods, cannot be formed. That means for all intents and purposes, the country is limited to trade with only its inhabitants, secluded from the rest of the world.

Russia also has other geographic problems, such as the Northern European Flatland, an expanse of plains that historically has been used to invade Russia. It is perfect and ripe for invasion. This means that Russia must make buffer states to block a potential invasion, so an enemy cannot exploit this pivotal weakness of theirs. This was a fundamental fact of Stalinist strategy and is still relevant in Putin’s strategy as well. 
Russia’s geography isn’t entirely a bad side, it’s natural resources helped them thrive and become a world power despite their geography. They are almost entirely dependent on their oil exports and thrive off of them. A large portion of Europe is dependent on Russian oil. Though, the US is taking much effort to counter this, through increasing oil exports to European countries by shipping it over the ocean, as well as asking Saudi Arabia to ramp up oil exports. 
NATO and Russia should craft a new mutually beneficial relationship, where Russia gives in on geopolitical interests in exchange for unfettered port usage. Russia does not have the capability to sustain its current amount of influence, and that will be the easy way of admitting that fundamental fact. It would grow Russia’s economy, and thus allow us to benefit from Russian goods. It could also potentially grant us a powerful playing card against Russia. Once Russia becomes reliant on our ports, who says we couldn’t threaten to cut off access? Russia is desperate for economic growth. A new port could be the thing that spurs it, and they know this. 

What we in Western and developed countries don’t understand is that if a country is not successful, it isn’t always due to flaws on their part, but sometimes due to factors out of their control like geography, culture, and history. All people want to be successful, and everywhere has at least someone that would be willing to work for it. The question is whether they have the tools they need for success, not whether they want it hard enough.

214,An Age Limit on the Presidency?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/an-age-limit-on-the-presidency/,"Ronald Reagan famously used a joke during a presidential debate to put to bed the issue of being “too old” to serve as president.
But that was 1984, and Reagan served his second term in his mid ’70s.
Today we have two candidates running for president–Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders–who are in their late ’70s and if either were elected president, would be serving into his ’80s.

Is that too old?
Former president Jimmy Carter thinks so.
Carter, who now is 95, came out to say that even 80 years old is too old to be up for the all of what the job of president of the United States demands.
And Carter, who served in the White House from 1977-1981, would know. Which means we as citizens should probably take his warning seriously.
Now as he made his remarks, Carter was smiling and laughing, which means surely he wasn’t proposing some new strict constitutional amendment limiting presidential service.
He simply was offering some wise counsel. It’s up to us to take heed.

215,We Need to Get Rid of the Useless Penny,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/we-need-to-get-rid-of-the-useless-penny/,"Remember when you asked where our taxpayer money is going? Well, in 2018, the U.S. Treasury minted seven billion new pennies.
It cost more than $105 million, at a production cost of 1.5 cents per penny.
Think about that for a second. That’s a -33 percent return, or $35 million lost, not including the cost of transportation or labor. In the grand scheme of things, 35 million isn’t much. But it adds up. A 35 million here, 5 billion there, and soon, a few tens or hundred billion have been wasted.
Talk about a bad investment.
Pennies cause more even more trouble than they are worth — quite literally. With the average hourly wage in the U.S. at more than $22 an hour, the average worker makes 6/10ths of a cent every second. If you take three seconds to stop and pick up a penny, you would be at a net loss, assuming you were on your work shift. Even if you aren’t working, you’re just adding to the extra time you spent handling (useless) pennies every year.

In fact, you would probably be better off if you threw away all your pennies and never saw one again. After all, the average American spends 2.4 hours a year handling pennies. That’s 2.4 hours you could have spent watching TV. Or sleeping. Or working.
Even if you don’t have a job and decide to pick up a penny. You’ll need to find 399 more before you can buy yourself McDonald’s. The fact that the penny was just sitting on the floor should signify how much our society values the penny.
The answer? It doesn’t. As Huffington Post contributor Nick Wing puts it, “It seems like the only reason to carry pennies now is to protect yourself against getting more of them.”
The penny is literally worthless. Vending machines no longer accept it. Its purchasing power is next to none, even if you group them together. Give a homeless man a penny, and he’s no better off. Most people don’t even bother keeping the pennies they get at cash registers — they just leave them for the next person. In fact, some Chipotle restaurants decided to stop using pennies altogether and just round down, even at a loss to themselves. In the end, pennies only provide a net loss for both the government and other people.
Did I mention the environment? Pennies aren’t actually made of copper anymore. Instead, zinc is used. However, the environmental cost of mining and molding zinc is far beyond the value of the penny that is produced.
Then why do we still have them?

Well, the most commonly argued point for the penny is that removing it would result in, “rounding tax,” where stores round prices to the nearest nickel and therefore consumers would have to pay extra. According to a 1990 study by economist Raymond Lombra, this would trigger mass-inflation because the extra costs would bring the Consumer Price Index (CPI) up, which is closely tied with inflation. The study looked at convenience store’s prices and simply assumed that each consumer would buy three items in one visit.
However, another study in 2006 based on actual consumer data, says that consumers would be better off getting rid of the penny. Besides the time factor, consumers would actually make more money than they lose.
Even if consumers do end up coming up negative, the amount would be far from enough to affect the economy enough cause widespread inflation.
Furthermore, all this assumes that people pay with cash. Not only is e-commerce growing, so is the use of a credit card, which have become more convenient and just as, if not more, widely accepted compared to cash. This means cash use has been steadily declining, making pennies even more obsolete.

The remaining reason to keep the penny would be solely for sentimental purposes. Quite simply put, Americans just want to keep the penny. Despite its impracticality, Americans don’t want to say goodbye to the penny and our beloved Abraham Lincoln. But remember, Lincoln is still on the five dollar bill. And in the end, is a cent really worth its tremendous cost?
Next time you see a penny? Don’t bother picking it up.

216,Brett Kavanaugh Has No Business Serving on the Supreme Court,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/brett-kavanaugh-has-no-business-serving-on-the-supreme-court/,"As the battle to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court reached its zenith, Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and then-Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) made an agreement which would allow for an FBI investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh.
At the time, Flake insisted on a true investigation, saying, “It does no good to have an investigation that gives us more cover.”
Mr. Coons declared that “the FBI needs to be allowed to pursue all reasonable investigatory steps.” 

However, now a pair of New York Times reporters working on a book about the Kavanaugh confirmation just published an article which found that the FBI investigation appears to have been nothing more than a sham.
This apparently was not the fault of FBI investigators; rather Senate Republicans who insisted on a rush job.
The result is a number of interviews not pursued to confirm the allegations of Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh’s Yale classmate who said that he exposed himself to her.
We as Americans were asked to put our faith in that investigation as the basis for allowing Kavanaugh to rise to the nation’s highest court under what had been a cloud of sexual misconduct.
If now we cannot have faith in that investigation which was supposed to have cleared him, perhaps now we can no longer have faith in Kavanaugh’s service on that high court.

217,"Lying About His Statements, Donald Trump Seems To Think He Leads North Korea",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/lying-about-his-statements-donald-trump-seems-to-think-he-leads-north-korea/,"Immediately after the attack on Saudi oil facilities, Donald Trump and his administration immediately chose to blame Iran for the violence.
However, Trump went a step further and brought back his “fake news” conflict with the media to claim that the media is lying by reporting that he would meet with Iran’s leadership “without preconditions.”
Except that that’s exactly what Trump and his senior officials have said, again and again.

News networks have Trump and these others saying so.
Trump appears to be confused with his dear friend, the autocratic Kim Jong Un. This isn’t North Korea. Trump can’t say something–anything–especially on tape and think he can pretend he never said it.
The more he claims he didn’t say something he actually said, the more the news media will play it over and over.
And in a situation like this, it’s potentially even more dangerous. Look at it from Iran’s point of view. Trump repeatedly promised to talk with no preconditions.
Now he blames them for a massive attack and denies making a pledge he demonstrably made.
Where does that leave any chance for a diplomatic solution?

218,"Don’t Wait, Ban Vape",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/dont-wait-ban-vape/,"In the light of a new unknown lung disease linked to vaping and already killing six people, the Trump administration is considering a mass ban on vaping products, excluding non-flavored ones. This would require all vaping products to be off-shelf in 30 days, and require Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for each product before it can be sold again.
E-cigarettes and vaping were originally created to help adult smokers quit smoking. However, underage vaping has created an epidemic of teenaged smokers and vapers. Most of them say they are attracted to the wide variety of flavors offered, such as mango, creme, and strawberry.
In a statement, Juul, a vaping manufacturer who has taken the most blame for this incident said, “We strongly agree with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products. We will fully comply with the final FDA policy when effective.”

However, this kind of epidemic requires immediate action. There is no time do argue over this. Every day that the ban is delayed means tens of thousands of vapes sold to people possibly unaware of the consequences. In fact, most vapers don’t even realize that vaping has negative effects.
As Dr. Buonopane, Assistant Medical Director at Mountainside Treatment Center, an addiction treatment center, puts it, “…there is enough information to put the vaping industry on hold. The federal government should suspend the sale of e-cigarettes while it conducts further research about their potential health risks. However, to make the possession of e-cigarettes illegal at this time would be counterproductive.
The general public needs to be made aware of the severe medical issues that have been associated with the use of these devices. The use of e-cigarettes may be deadly. Six people have already died and hundreds have developed severe respiratory symptoms in connection with vaping or use of e-cigarettes.

Epidemiological investigations are ongoing, and the CDC is recommending that healthcare professionals report cases of respiratory symptoms connected with vaping. E-cigarettes typically contain nicotine, but flavorings and other chemicals may be added as well as marijuana or other substances. Many of the patients — but not all — who developed respiratory symptoms reported the use of e-cigarettes containing cannabinoid products, such as THC or CBD.
For example, five cases of acute respiratory symptoms likely caused by aerosolized oils inhaled from e-cigarettes were reported in the September 6 issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly. In these cases, a diagnosis of exogenous lipoid pneumonia was made due to the presence of lipid infiltrates in the lungs. Please note that e-cigarettes are not FDA approved to quit smoking, and the available science on their effectiveness on smoking cessation is inconclusive. In addition, they promote the use of nicotine, which can interfere with brain development in adolescence.”
While a cause has not yet been determined, there has been some correlation with high dosages of Vitamin E Acetate, and the FDA is currently investigating.

The opposition to the ban claim that the ban would create a black market of vapes. Keep in mind though, there already is a black market — vapes shouldn’t be sold or given to underage minors, yet they somehow still get access to them. Enforcing a ban on all flavored vapes would make it harder for minors to get access to them. While some might resort to black market sales, others will simply cease.
A ban like this could also be a wake-up call to cigarette providers that the FDA is going to enact tougher regulations on the smoking industry. In the end, the only losers are vaping companies.

219,September Democratic Presidential Debate Recap,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/september-democratic-presidential-debate/,"Another month gone, another Democratic debate to usher in the fall season. Thank goodness this one was culled down to 10 candidates, and could actually be more substantial. While the multitude of speakers introducing the candidates didn’t exactly speed things up, they did
set a more serious tone for the debate. Once Hinojosa and Perez took
the stage, we got several clues to how the debate would go: the word
“Texodus” (not sure how I feel about that one yet), clever puns on how
bad the Republicans are (sorry, John Cornyn), and a sense that change
is in the air, and that all the candidates would be shifting towards bolder actions. Here’s my take on how everyone did. This will be more opinionated than previous reviews, for the simple fact that there are
fewer candidates and more policy to discuss. From best to worst, here
they are:
Elizabeth Warren
You know, after three great debates, I think I now have to call myself a Warren supporter. Whether it’s her unique idea of reforming the State Department internally or eliminating the filibuster, Elizabeth Warren has stayed realistic, yet creative throughout these debates. She doesn’t take cheap potshots and she doesn’t make empty promises of executive orders. Instead, she works with Congress, using regulatory power and diplomacy to achieve her goals. Warren has been able to
sidestep much of the sniping on the debate stage because while she is progressive, she’s always controlled, and insulting her doesn’t really do much good.

Beto O’Rourke
The third debate was Beto’s best debate so far. He had an advantage, being both from the same state the debate was in, and being recently affected by the El Paso shootings, and I thought he used his advantage
quite effectively, without pandering or capitalizing on tragedy. Beto has carved a position for himself as the gun-control candidate, and was given the airtime to air some other ideas. For anyone who missed
it, the idea of paying farmers for environmental services is a new,
workable, and potentially bipartisan idea, and I’m glad to see it on the stage. I am still unhappy with reparations being floated as an actual, possible idea, but if Beto’s smart, he’ll leave it alone once he gets through the primary.
Bernie Sanders
It’s very hard to see past my own biases with Bernie: I don’t like his approach or his views and it colors my perspective. However, in tonight’s debate, he objectively did pretty well. He did “write the damn bill,” and he has justified the cost of Medicare-For-All. He does have an F from the NRA, and so I thought that this debate, Bernie used his record to solidify and perhaps expand his base. His comment about not spending on the military until there is an enemy perhaps assuage
fears that he would spend without limits as president. Do I like Democratic Socialism? Not really, no. Do I enjoy Bernie’s abrasive
style? Not at all. However, Bernie approached other candidates with
the appropriate respect before criticizing them, backed up his points, and overall did a good job this debate.
Pete Buttigieg
Mayor Pete never does badly, per se, but in a debate full of bold ideas, he didn’t exactly stand out. I have no problems with Pete
Buttigieg, and I really like some of his ideas–the sunset clause on new wars being one. On the other hand, while Buttigieg certainly never performs badly, and is always on top of his game, I don’t think
anything he did this debate convinced voters to switch to his side. Buttigieg has a race problem, and he knows it. Yet, debate after debate, he has never made a concrete attempt to win over minority voters that feel alienated from him. Yes, he spoke three words of Spanish. No, that’s not what I mean. Buttigieg certainly didn’t lose support, but I can’t say he gained it.

Amy Klobuchar
I’ll tell you this much: my moderate Democrat dad really likes Amy
Klobuchar, and she’s stuck around more than any of the other moderates. With Ryan, Delaney et al. out of the race and the debates, Klobuchar’s moderate approach seems less par for the course and more
original. The bad news for Klobuchar is that moderation is a bit of a losing strategy in this particular primary. She handled herself well at the debate, but gave an opening statement about not leaning into
extremes not five minutes after the introducing speakers (Hinojosa and
Perez) riled up the audience about how change needs to come, and come now. Klobuchar’s debate performances are always controlled and professional, but her status as the last moderate is telling.
Joe Biden
It’s going to be an interesting race with Joe Biden. He’s got lots of experience, and lots of positive points to talk about, but he keeps getting caught in one major flaw, a flaw that other candidates haverepeatedly pointed out. He wants to synonymize himself with Obama, but
continues to waffle when directly asked to question President Obama’s decisions. While that’s understandable for an ex-Vice President, it’s tiresome. Biden was strong as the realistic candidate, a candidate who
cares about the Constitution and the budget. He’s got bipartisan, reasonable ideas, but he’ll continue to struggle on the debate stage until he figures out how to get around his Obama quagmire.
Kamala Harris
This was definitely a better debate for Harris than her last one, but nowhere near as good as her first. She successfully defended a critique of her tough-on-crime past, which is impressive in a field
that refuses to own up to past mistakes. On the other hand, Harris does a lot of promising. Last night it was, “Executive order this,” “Day 1 change that.” She came across as fairly flippant towards the idea of
congressional approval for her plans, which is especially concerning in the Trump era. Harris has good ideas, but she lately has debated as though she’ll have sole power over policy making in the United States as president. Maybe promises will help her falling support in the polls,
but they make her a worrisome candidate.
Cory Booker
Vegans take heed: Booker is here for you. Joking aside, Booker had more substance tonight, but for me, stayed solidly average. He has a record to use, and on education at least, he brought that record to shine, providing solutions that benefit both parents with public and charter school students. On the other hand, Booker did some classic question dodging and shifting, didn’t have all that much speaking
time, and still comes across as a bit of a panderer to me. I think I’d need two hands to count how many times he referred to living in a poor, black and brown neighborhood or his work there. Booker has been around in politics for too long for that to be his signature achievement.
Andrew Yang
I’m surprised Andrew Yang is still in the race, and he certainly hasn’t changed tactics. Actually beta testing his universal basic income plan was interesting (For those who don’t know, Yang will give you $1,000 if you have the best application on his website), but only strengthens my opinion of him as a gimmick. When asked why he was the most qualified politically, he dodged the question, and after four years of an entrepreneur running things, Yang has a lot of ground to cover to convince voters he’s a serious politician. His plan to handle tariffs and the trade war was the closest thing voters got to a normal policy plan, and that’s in his strong area. I find Yang interesting, and his approach is certainly novel, but I don’t see him progressing into the serious primaries.

Julian Castro
Oh, Julian. In a serious debate, you can’t win by being the political equivalent of a hockey enforcer (for those who don’t know: it’s the guy who fights the other team’s players). I’m not saying Castro’s
attacks didn’t hurt Biden; they certainly did. However, I don’t believe they helped Castro either. Castro appeared almost jealous of Biden’s position as Vice President as he was more interested in calling Joe Biden out than in defending his own record. The most memorable thing about Castro tonight was his snipes at other
Democrats, which is really concerning in an election where the Republican challenger will be Donald Trump. Klobuchar and other moderates talked about unity in the face of extremist opposition, and Julian Castro didn’t seem to get that point.

220,Defeat Judicial Appointment for Steven Menashi (and All Those Like It),https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/defeat-judicial-appointment-for-steven-menashi-and-all-those-like-it/,"Although Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has turned the Senate this year into a legislative graveyard, from which scant legislation has emerged–there is one activity the Kentucky Republican has kept humming with little interruption: federal judicial confirmations.
Almost no matter how extreme or unqualified, McConnell and his Senate Republicans are busily packing the federal courts with right-wing judges just as fast as they can before they might lose the Senate majority.
But every once in a while, a Trump nominee comes forward who is even more noticeably worse than the rest.

Steven Menashi is one of those.
Currently the top attorney in Secretary Betsy DeVos’s Education Department, Menashi has been nominated for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, where his nomination is opposed by both US senators.
“It is clear from Steven Menashi’s long, disturbing record that he is the wrong candidate to serve on the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York,” said a joint statement by Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, both New York Democrats. “As the top lawyer at the Department of Education, he played a critical role in executing Secretary DeVos’s agenda to make it harder for campus sexual assault victims to seek justice, provide federal funding to schools that discriminate against LGBTQ students, roll back civil rights investigations, and undermine critical protections for student borrowers who were defrauded by their institutions.
“In addition, he has expressed hostility to commonsense gun safety legislation and foundational civil rights legislation, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964,” the statement continued. “His views are far outside the judicial mainstream and completely out of step with the overwhelming majority of New Yorkers. His confirmation to the federal judiciary would threaten the rights of millions of Americans, and we strongly urge our colleagues to oppose the Menashi nomination.” 
So, yes, defeat the Steven Menashi nomination. But defeat all of the other ones just like it which Mitch McConnell is trying to ram through.

221,"We Have Met Our Greatest Security Threat, and It Is Us",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/we-have-met-our-greatest-security-threat-and-it-is-us/,"As we stop to remember the solemn events of September 11, 2001, perhaps we can recall nothing more important than the great spirit of togetherness and national unity that the terrible terrorist attacks of that day engendered across the nation.
People–complete strangers, even–began to show much more spontaneous kindness and thoughtfulness for their fellows in the wake of those horrible events.

Of course, over time that unity would wane. But today, it’s given way to open hatred and what could accurately be described as a cold civil war.
Former defense secretary James Mattis recently lamented “the increasing contempt I see between Americans who have different opinions.”
“We have to sit down and remember, if we want this country to survive, we have to work together,” he advised.
So nearly two decades after the World Trade Center fell, the Pentagon fell under siege and Flight 93 came down in Shanksville, Penn., we as Americans would do well to recapture some of that warm national feeling that we seem to have lost.

222,Winning 2020 Will Be Harder Than Trump Thinks,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/winning-2020-will-be-harder-than-trump-thinks/,"Donald Trump will have to deal with a very unique challenge which other incumbent presidents have not had to face, at least in modern times, as he seeks a second term.
And that’s before he faces a single Democrat.
That’s because, as Trump seeks renomination as the Republican candidate for president, he will be opposed by not one, not two…but three rival Republicans seeking to deny him renomination.

Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh and now former South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford.
In the past when a sitting president faced a primary challenge from within his own party, it always before has been from a single strong rival.
Think Ronald Reagan against Gerald Ford in 1976, Edward Kennedy against Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Pat Buchanan vs. George H.W. Bush in 1992.
In each of those cases, the primary challenger failed to deny the incumbent renomination. But the primary fight is seen as also fatally wounding him in November when it came to each’s respective general election.
So what will happen this time, as Trump must bypass multiple rivals?
Will having so many GOP opponents dilute the field? Or will the three rivals provide a strong anti-Trump voice?
“I think it’s that there’s a subset that’s not in step with President Trump. And you’re seeing that frustration from that wing of the party that is, you know, the more traditional people who have been around for a long time for the most part,” said Washington Post reporter Karoun Demirjian. “These candidates putting their name out to say that they will challenge Trump for the party nomination. Now, how significant of a challenge that any one of them can mount is up for question, because they don’t have the same sort of spotlight or soapbox or name recognition at this point as President Trump does.
“It takes a lot for anybody to challenge a sitting president also: What opportunity are they going to actually have to be able to launch a campaign that can compete with the president’s that’s been well underway for a while? We don’t know. But the fact that more and more names keep coming out there suggest that there’s a part of the GOP that’s up for grabs. Whether it’s going to be one of these candidates or the general election that they’re not comfortable with Trump. And if there’s a sizable enough number of people that aren’t comfortable with Trump, that could mean more numbers of humans in play when we actually get to the general election” in November.

223,"Instead of Preparing for Hurricane, Trump Decides Golfing is More Important",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/he-got-updates-while-he-was-playing-golf/,"Granted, it’s been a few years, so if anyone needs a reminder how a real president responds to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, please refer to the photo that accompanies this article.
You will find President Barack Obama famously helping in the wake of Superstorm Sandy. He’s standing with the governor of the affected state (and of the opposing political party, no less!), working seriously to meet the needs of those who live where the storm hit.

Both practically and emotionally, he helped victims–and the nation as a whole–heal and feel better.
Then, there’s this other guy.
This is the guy whose entire response to one storm involved how to get three-point shots out of roll after roll of paper towels.
So, with the monster known as Hurricane Dorian now threatening Florida and the rest of the Southeastern US coast, is Donald Trump closeted away in the Oval Office with advisers?
Is he in wall-to-wall meetings with FEMA and state leaders?
Okay, you can stop laughing now. But no. He’s been keeping up with his golf game. But, nothing to worry about, he’s got this disaster thing, too.

“We got updates while I was there,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said of hanging around with Trump at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland. “Got updates, I know he played golf yesterday and got updates while he was going golf.”
Floridians and Americans, you can rest easy, right? Right???

224,Finding Out What Voters Really Think About Presidental Debates,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/technology/finding-out-what-voters-really-think-about-presidental-debates/,"With the 2020 presidential campaign season underway, a new cycle of debates has been set in motion — complete with perpetual analysis as to what transpired in each. But the accuracy of polls and post-debate surveys are limited by their dependence on a voters’ stated responses, which are inaccurate reflections of their true positions.
Once commentators begin declaring winners, voter’s reinterpret their own perceptions of the debate. Even a survey taken immediately after the debate (before the spin begins) is colored by a voter’s perception of who won, as they reframe the debate in their mind.
Therefore, understanding how voters ‘actually’ experience debate is critical because it tells us much more than the debate’s winners and losers. To unveil the “why’s” behind the “what’s,” researchers need granular, second-by-second analysis of voter response. Only this level of analysis can facilitate the accurate measurement of each argument and exchange.
Historically, the only way to get such data was through dial testing. A select group of ‘undecided’ voters turn a dial during the course of the debate to indicate their agreement/disagreement with a candidate’s statements. Typically, their collective response is represented as a graphic overlay (popularly called the ‘worm’) superimposed over a telecast.

While dial testing has a long tradition, it suffers from numerous flaws. First, measurement is limited to undecided voters since supporters subconsciously game their response by cranking the dial down whenever an opponent speaks and up when their candidate speaks. But elections are seldom won by independent voters alone and ignoring supporters leaves a critical gap in understanding the true dynamics of the debate.
What’s worse, even undecided voters are rarely “fair” referees. If you analyze their response patterns, you will see that many begin cranking their dials before a candidate has even made their argument. In other words, undecided voters are seldom ‘truly’ undecided… they have their leanings… and those leanings influence their dial behavior.
And, at the end of the day, dials are still a stated response; which means that we’re gauging the “rational” journey of voters during the debate. But as we know from recent neuroscience discoveries, our judgments as voters are often shaped by emotional dynamics, of which we often lack self-awareness. Consequently, it is critical to measure both the rational and emotional dimensions of the debate experience.
Fortunately, there is a range of tools today that better measure voter’s second-by-second experience during the debates. These biometric analytical tools afford new opportunities to more accurately measuring voter response on a continuous basis; including a voter’s underlying emotional journey. This represents a significant breakthrough that can dramatically improve post-debate analysis.

Such measures allow voters to experience a more ‘natural’ viewing experience, allowing them to be more absorbed in the debate content without continuously ‘thinking’ about how to respond. Since all voters can be accurately measured, whether undecided or supporter, deeper insights about the larger dynamic become available, including, for example, a comparison of levels of enthusiasm observed by supporters of different candidates. And, where dial testing treats the entire debate as a level playing field, biometrics unveil the ‘true’ dynamic, situating responses within the larger tide of the debate as voters typically become progressively more bored as the debate continues.
MediaScience incorporated such measures in our analyses of debates in the 2012 and 2016 elections, and in both cases, the results provided a trove of insights that couldn’t be accessed by other means.
Consider, for example, the 2012 vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. Analysis of dial data reveals little about the overall experience of the debate. Both candidates have numerous key moments throughout. But biometric data (specifically galvanic skin response) demonstrates not only how the audience become progressively more bored (situating key moments within a larger context), but, more importantly, how the entire debate has a single pivot – the point at which Biden tells Ryan, “What, now you’re Jack Kennedy.” Until then both groups of supporters evenly tracked in the debate, but after that Democrats were far more energized. With dial data, that key pivot presented as one of many key moments, masking its significance.
Biometric analysis during the 2016 election cycle was even more revealing, given the emotional dynamics associated with the Trump candidacy.
Our analysis of voter facial expressions revealed a high level of negative response by Democrats whenever Hillary Clinton spoke. A similar pattern was not replicated among Republicans who generally responded well to Trump throughout the debate. We framed this as a significant ‘enthusiasm gap,’ highlighting Democrat’s discomfort with their candidate.

Undecided voters were surprisingly engaged throughout the debate (an unusual finding) and responded best to policy discussions (where supporters typically became bored). This reflected an undecided voter different to that seen in the 2012 election, where voters were mostly undecided due to apathy. In our 2016 sample, undecided voters were genuinely grappling with whom to vote for and responded well to a discussion that could help influence their decision. On policy discussions, Trump had something of an emotional advantage among such voters; typically responding with strong definitive positions (‘in my first hundred days…’). Clinton, by contrast, was typically evasive or overly technical, resulting in lower emotional response.
But perhaps the most dramatic difference in the debate experience was across gender lines. A key part of the second presidential debate, for example, discussed the Entertainment Tonight sex tape recordings. For women, this was the most engaging part of the entire debate. Men, however, demonstrated remarkably low response levels.

225,Schumer Calls Trump’s Methane Rule Roll-back ‘Dagger in the Heart of Efforts to Preserve the Planet’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/schumer-calls-trumps-methane-rule-role-back-dagger-in-the-heart-of-efforts-to-preserve-the-planet/,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) slammed the Trump administration’s intention, announced Thursday, to weaken Obama-era rules governing the emission of climate-changing methane into the atmosphere.
Although carbon dioxide is a much more common climate change gas, methane is much stronger.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed rule would lessen restrictions on oil and gas sites to monitor and repair methane leaks from pipelines and storage facilities. It’s only the latest Trump administration weakening of Obama-era regulations.

“This illogical and devastating rule to weaken one of the most important regulations to address greenhouse gas emissions would be a dagger in the heart of efforts to preserve the planet,” Schumer said. “The Trump administration’s proposed rollback of these regulations—which oil and gas companies actually support—would be another, horrifying blow to our already-imperiled environment.
“There is no sense in denying methane’s significant role in the climate crisis. Senate Democrats will fight to repeal these new regulations through our Congressional Review Act authority,” he added.

226,Lineup for September Democratic Presidential Debate Set,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/lineup-for-september-democratic-presidential-debate-set/,"Democratic National Committee officials have set the lineup for the next Democratic presidential debate. Unlike the first two such debates, the September event will be held to just 10 of the candidates jousting on stage during a single evening.
The debate will take place September 12 in Houston, Texas and will be broadcast on the ABC television network.
Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Beto O’Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, Julian Castro and Andrew Yang all made the cut to appear in the September debate, based on their status in polling and the number of donors they attracted.

That leaves 10 other Democratic contenders, including billionaire Tom Steyer, out in the cold.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) dropped out of the presidential contest Wednesday specifically because she didn’t make the cut for the September debate.
However, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said she doesn’t plan to drop her presidential bid after not making the cut despite being featured during the first two.
“Yeah, obviously the debates are a great platforms to be able to reach a lot of people across this country, but it’s not the only way to be able to talk to voters and to be able to spend time with them,” she said. “That’s exactly what I’m doing here in Iowa and I’ll continue to do across the country.
“Being able to get out into these small towns and big cities, getting to people’s living rooms and sitting around the kitchen table really talking about the issues that are important to them is the kind of people-powered grassroots campaign that we are running,” Gabbard added. “And I look forward to being able to continue to have the opportunity to do that.”

227,Gillibrand Drops Out of 2020 Race,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/gillibrand-drops-out-of-2020-race/,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, the senator from New York who struggled to get much traction in polling, dropped her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination Wednesday.
Wednesday was the deadline for the next Democratic presidential debate, with tighter qualifications for candidates to make the debate stage.

Gillibrand failed to make that debate.
The 52-year-old lawmaker tweeted her withdrawal.
‘I’m ending my campaign for president. I’m so proud of this team and all we’ve accomplished but I think it’s important to know how you can best serve,” she wrote. “To our supporters, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Now let’s go beat Donald Trump and win back the Senate.”

228,Appeals Court Upholds Block on Abortion Restriction,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/appeals-court-upholds-block-on-abortion-restriction/,"The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday upheld a preliminary injunction against a restrictive Indiana state abortion law, SEA 404, that would have imposed undue burdens on young women’s personal medical decisions.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana challenged the law on behalf of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky (PPINK) and its patients. In 2017, a federal district court blocked the law from taking effect, concluding that it “places an unjustifiable burden on mature minors in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.”
SEA 404 included an unnecessary and dangerous add-on to Indiana’s existing parental consent law, which the lawsuit asserts would endanger young women in vulnerable circumstances, according to the ACLU. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a minor who is unable or unwilling to obtain parental consent for an abortion must be allowed to obtain an abortion if a judge determines that she is sufficiently mature to make the decision herself or that an abortion is in her best interest. Indiana has long had such a procedure.
SEA 404 would burden a minor’s ability to obtain an abortion by allowing parents to be notified, even in cases in which a judge has determined that a young woman is mature enough to make the decision herself. The evidence in the case demonstrated that the notice provision might lead to young women being harmed or harming themselves, the ACLU said.

“This decision affirms that the state must continue to provide a safe alternative for young women who – whatever their circumstances – are unable to talk to their parents about this difficult and personal decision,” said Ken Falk, legal director at the ACLU of Indiana. “Legislators need to stop targeting women with invasive hurdles and start respecting the rights of all Hoosiers to make their own personal medical decisions. These heavy-handed restrictions would have burdened young women’s constitutional rights and put their health and safety at risk.”

229,Georgia GOP Now Must Defend Two Senate Seats in 2020,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/georgia-gop-now-must-defend-two-senate-seats-in-2020/,"In a potential boost to Democratic hopes to retake the Senate majority in next year’s elections, Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) announced Wednesday that he would resign his seat at year’s end, leaving the Georgia GOP defending two seats in 2020.
Isakson said that he notified Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) about his impending resignation. Kemp must now name someone who will serve through the 2020 election and must run to hold the seat.
Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) already is up for re-election next year.

The Peach State has been a safe Republican state for a generation but Democrat Stacey Abrams nearly defeated Kemp in last year’s gubinatorial election. Democrats also won several congressional seats from Georgia away from Republicans.
Like the Perdue race, Abrams almost immediately declined to run for Isakson’s seat. However, she said she would work to combat voter suppression.
Isakson clearly is departing with a heavy heart.
“I am leaving a job I love because my health challenges are taking their toll on me, my family and my staff. My Parkinson’s has been progressing, and I am continuing physical therapy to recover from a fall in July,” the three-term senator said in a statement. “In addition, this week I had surgery to remove a growth on my kidney.
“In my 40 years in elected office, I have always put my constituents and my state of Georgia first. With the mounting health challenges I am facing, I have concluded that I will not be able to do the job over the long term in the manner the citizens of Georgia deserve,” Isakson added. “It goes against every fiber of my being to leave in the middle of my Senate term, but I know it’s the right thing to do on behalf of my state.

230,‘This Felt Much More Like a G6 Than a G7’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/this-felt-much-more-like-a-g6-than-a-g7/,"Donald Trump spent a weekend meeting with world leaders largely trying to sell them on gathering next year at one of his luxury properties–but otherwise largely ineffective, according to a variety of political observers.
Trump traveled to last weekend to the G7 meeting of world leaders held in Biarritz, France where he skipped meetings but tried to sell his counterparts on gathering next year at his Doral Miami resort.
“…This felt much more like a G6 than a G7,” said former Republican congressman David Jolly. ” This is a president with each passing summit that we realize is simply not taken seriously on the world stage. He’s not respected. He’s not even feared, which was once kind of the calling card of Donald Trump, if you will, in his unpredictability, at least he was feared. This is a president that’s merely placated. He’s that relative at the family gatherings that you just nod your head and say, ‘Okay’ to. He’s the person in the south that they say, ‘Oh, sure, bless your heart,’ kind of thing.

“This is a president on the world stage who’s not respected by his peers,” Jolly added. “And among allies, I think why this was maybe noneventful, it’s okay among allies in freedom, but it’s among communities of nation states that weren’t there where it really is distressing, when we talk about his bilateral relations with Russia, his comments almost forgiving, if you will, Russia’s invasion of the Ukraine.”
Attorney Richard Painter slammed Trump’s performance at the G7, including trying to sell his resort for the next meeting.
“This would be illegal if he takes any money for hotel rooms for food or beverages or golfing or anything else. It is a clear violation of the United States Constitution,” said Painter, who was top ethics attorney in the George W. Bush White House. “Second, he’s using his presidency to promote his own that’s a conflict of interest entirely apart from the emolument clause.
“This is a president who shows no interest in the key topics of the G-7 meeting including climate change. He’s not willing to attend meetings. He does not want to show up for serious discussions but wants to use this to tout his business. It is an embarrassment for the United States that this is going on.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) particularly expressed outrage that Trump chose to skip the climate change meeting given the wildfires currently engulfing the Amazon rainforest.
“The power of television in the visual was so graphically demonstrated by that picture. You know, a picture is worth a thousand words. The empty chair at a climate change meeting, when literally the planet is burning in Brazil, when climate change is uppermost in the minds of many, many Americans who truly believe that it is caused by man and has to be addressed by all of us, that kind of abdication and absence of leadership is a profound disservice to our nation and our national security,” he said. “Because as our military leaders will tell you, and I know from my experience on the Armed Services Committee, climate change and global warming are a national security threat to the United States. That empty chair speaks volumes about the absence of leadership.”

231,Progressive Group Gears Up To Kill Senate Filibuster,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/progressive-group-gears-up-to-kill-senate-filibuster/,"A national network of progressive activists is looking to take an active role in a Democratic effort to eliminate the filibuster in the Senate.
Indivisible, the Democratic-oriented organization founded in the wake of Donald Trump’s election as part of “the resistance,” outlined its plan to eliminate the filibuster in an email to supporters.

In its rationale, Indivisible envisions a scenario in January 2021 in which Democrats have won control of the entire federal government by holding the House of Representatives while winning the presidency and retaking the Senate majority.
“Our newly elected leaders have a narrow post-election window of opportunity to enact progressive legislation, including major structural reforms that will finally get our democracy working for the people,” the email said. “That means things like health care, the Green New Deal, voting rights expansion, immigration and human rights, fair election maps, gun violence prevention, and every issue you care about. These ideas are popular, and should be achievable.
“But wait: the picture isn’t quite as rosy as it looks. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (ha!) waves his hand and says one magic word, and suddenly all of our legislation is stopped in its tracks,” the Indivisible email added.
“What’s the magic word? Filibuster.”
Indivisible noted that the filibuster is not based in law or the Constitution but rather simply Senate rules.
Once a parliamentary rarity, use of the filibuster has skyrocketed in recent decades. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell regularly used the filibuster when Republicans were in the minority during much of the Obama administration, so as to block passage of Democratic legislation.

“That’s why we’re launching our FiliBUSTED campaign. We need to start getting our 2020 candidates on the record in support of abolishing the filibuster when they take office in 2021, so we can hit the ground running for the people as soon as possible,” the email said.
Indivisible said that it was raising funds to pay for video and email tools to support its campaign.
Meanwhile, Indivisible isn’t the only one on the left moving to kill the filibuster.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the leading Democrats running for president, has said that she would seek the end of the filibuster as part of her plan to enact new gun safety measures.
“I will do everything I can by executive order, but I will also lead on the argument of getting rid of the filibuster so that by a majority we can do what the American people have sent us there to do. The filibuster is blocking action on guns,” Warren said. “It’s part of the way that the gun manufacturers hold Congress enthralled, and we’ve got to stop that.”
Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington State and until he dropped out last week another Democratic presidential candidate, also seeks to kill the filibuster so as to pass legislation to address his signature issue of climate change, as well as other major problems.
“This is not a moment for inincrementalism. We need big action on climate change, guns, health care. None of those are possible if we allow Mitch McConnell to have the filibuster,” Inslee said. “And we have to get rid of the filibuster. The filibuster, as you know, allows Mitch McConnell with only 40 votes to prevent even bipartisan measures from come to the Senate.”
Inslee said he is not happy with other Democrats running for president who are not supportive of eliminating the filibuster.

“Listen, I mean, I think [Joe] Biden is concerned about eliminating the filibuster. Cory Booker is concerned about — their argument is: You’re talking about radically changing the way the U.S. government has worked for centuries because you’re frustrated with Mitch McConnell.
“Look, I’ve been against the filibuster since 2009. It hasn’t been part of American history 200 years actually just a few decades. Now it’s being used totally differently than it was envisioned to be used,” he added. “It’s not in the U.S. Constitution. This is just a rule. This is an anti-democracy action. I know this is radical, but I believe one person should have one vote. And one senator should have one vote. And no other senators should get 1.5 votes. That’s what a filibuster does.”
Even former senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who led Senate Democrats both in the minority and majority until his retirement in 2017, has come out in favor of doing away with the filibuster to achieve Democratic priorities.
McConnell, meanwhile, must be quite worried that Democrats could a) retake the Senate and b) follow through on killing the filibuster, because–quite surprisingly–he published an op-ed article last week in The New York Times warning Democrats to leave the filibuster alone.
Some see McConnell’s arguments as nothing more than self-serving, however, given that he’s taken Senate obstruction to new heights: including the denial of a hearing for President Barack Obama’s final Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.
“There’s a strong degree of irony to McConnell’s arguments: Even as he’s pushing for Democrats to keep the filibuster in the name of preserving Senate rules and tradition, he’s personally done significant damage to congressional norms,” journalist Li Zhou wrote in Vox.

This month, the Trump White House unveiled a new policy it had aggressively pushed through the regulatory process that makes it much harder for low-income immigrants, especially those who had used public benefits, to come to or remain in the United States.The proposal — known as the “public charge” rule, since it creates a complicated test to determine whether an immigrant is “likely to be a public charge” — has the potential to dramatically restrict who’s allowed to settle in the country. And many people who work with immigrants, including social service providers and local and state governments, are worried that it will scare them away from using benefits they and their families need to thrive.To soften the blow, the rule contains a few exceptions — groups of immigrants who are allowed to use public benefits without jeopardizing their future immigration status. But the rule is so sloppily written that it ended up treating immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens more harshly than immigrants married to noncitizens.Active-duty service members who are immigrant noncitizens are allowed to use benefits without having it weigh against them as a “public charge” in the future. So are the family members of active-duty immigrant service members. But immigrants who are the spouses or children of active-duty service members who are U.S. citizens are not included in the exception, meaning their use of benefits while their spouses were on active duty could jeopardize their future in the U.S.
“It’s sloppy drafting. They’re trying to get the regulation out sooner than is probably practical,” said Charles Wheeler, an immigration attorney at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc.A spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that developed and is implementing the rule, declined to comment because of pending litigation against the regulation. (Three lawsuits have been filed challenging the policy: one by a coalition of 13 states and filed in Washington state, one by San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California, and one by a coalition of nonprofit groups in California.) A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.The regulation’s full text, detailed in 217 pages of three-column text in the Federal Register, contradicts its own implementing language regarding how the new rule will apply to military families. The government estimates it will take 16 to 20 hours just to read the regulation. And the form that’s supposed to implement the rule doesn’t distinguish between families of service members who are citizens and service members who are not citizens — although the form’s instructions do.“There are so many unknowns at the moment with how this regulation is going to be interpreted and applied for immigrant family members,” Wheeler said. “And certainly that complexity is going to discourage people from even applying for green cards and for benefits.”The public-charge regulation has been a top priority for the Trump White House, especially senior policy adviser Stephen Miller. For over a year, the White House has been pressuring USCIS to move more quickly to get it out the door.But the rule’s confusing treatment of military families demonstrates sloppy work. It has created inconsistencies between the rule’s technical text and the forms under development to implement it.The confusion over military families is one reason many social service providers, local and state governments, and lawyers are concerned that the rule’s impact will be much broader than its intended targets. With so much complexity and uncertainty about who will be treated differently under the new rule and how, they say it’s inevitable that immigrants who aren’t supposed to be targeted under the rule will be scared away from using public benefits to which they’re legally entitled.Under the new rule, which will go into effect in October barring an injunction in one of the lawsuits, people applying for permanent-resident status are subject to a complicated test of whether they’re likely to become a public charge based on their income, education level, credit scores and other factors. Past use of public benefits counts as a “heavily weighted negative factor” against an immigrant — one that it would be hard for an applicant to overcome.At one point, the preamble to the regulation says that “active duty servicemembers, including those in the Ready Reserve, and their spouses and children” are exempt from their use of public benefits being counted against them, implying that the exemption applies to all military families. In fact, it does not.
Deepening the confusion, USCIS has a form for applicants that doesn’t reflect the two standards mentioned in the rule. It asks immigrants applying for permanent residence to note, if appropriate, whether they are “the spouse or the child of an individual who is enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces, or is in active duty or in the Ready Reserve Component of the U.S. Armed Forces.” It does not ask about the citizenship status of the military service member.So spouses and children of U.S. citizen servicemembers would check “yes” on the question, even though the actual text of the regulation includes no exemption for them.Immigration lawyers and benefits experts contacted by ProPublica could cite no reason why the regulation would treat immigrants married to U.S. citizens more harshly than immigrants married to noncitizens, and they concluded that the double standard might have been unintentional. Asked why spouses of U.S. citizens might be excluded, Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, speculated, “They didn’t think of it?”“Clearly it’s so complicated that nobody understands it right now,” said Margaret Stock, an immigration lawyer with many military clients. “They’re going to make mistakes. There’s going to be massive amounts of confusion.”Doug Rand, a former White House official who worked on immigration issues in President Barack Obama’s administration, summed up the contradictory messages around the active-duty exemption: “This is chaos.”The treatment of military families is especially odd because the Department of Defense (unlike other arms of the federal government, like the Department of Veterans Affairs) took an active role to minimize the rule’s impact on military families. In the Federal Register preamble, USCIS wrote that the DOD worried that the new regulation “may give rise to concerns about servicemembers’ immigration status or the immigration status of servicemembers’ spouses and children … which would reduce troop readiness and interfere significantly with U.S. armed forces recruitment efforts.” Those concerns would appear to apply equally to immigrants married to citizens, and those married to noncitizens.A DOD spokeswoman confirmed to ProPublica that the agency was consulted on the regulation, but she declined to comment about the exclusion of spouses and children of U.S. citizens from the active-duty exemption.It’s not clear what exactly the impact of the double standard would be. In general, the immigrants who are targeted by the public-charge regulation are already legally ineligible for most public benefits. While military service members and their families are exempt from some of these restrictions — like the mandatory five-year waiting period before using any public benefits — military spouses who are unauthorized immigrants, for example, are still legally ineligible to receive most benefits.The concern raised by immigration lawyers and advocates, however, is that the public charge rule will scare immigrants who aren’t targeted (such as those who already have green cards) out of trying to get benefits to which they are legally entitled, and deter immigrants who are targeted from using benefits that aren’t covered in the rule.The regulation says, for example, that benefits obtained for children won’t count against their parents. So theoretically, an unauthorized immigrant who is raising a U.S. citizen child alone while their active-duty spouse is deployed can still apply for health insurance and food stamps for the child without damaging their future prospects for a green card. But it’s not at all clear whether military families themselves will get that message — especially because the regulation contradicts itself about their treatment.The public-charge regulation has been in development for much of President Donald Trump’s tenure, with drafts being circulated and published by the press in February 2018. While the Pentagon fought for exemptions to the policy for active-duty military and their families throughout 2018, the VA several times declined to do the same for veterans, according to emails obtained by ProPublica under a Freedom of Information Act request.The public comment period for the regulation began in September 2018 and ended in early December.
Over that time, the draft regulation received an unprecedented 266,000 public comments, which the government was legally obligated to read and respond to, in addition to finalizing the text of the regulation itself.However, the Trump administration, led by Miller, was eager to finalize the regulation as quickly as possible and pressed agencies to complete it. Miller even criticized USCIS director Francis Cissna over his perceived slowness in developing and finalizing the public charge regulation.“The timeline on public charge is unacceptable,” Miller wrote to Cissna in June 2018, in an email reported by Politico this month. “This is time we don’t have. I don’t care what you need to do to finish it on time.”In March 2019, after the comment period ended, Miller yelled at Cissna during a meeting to finalize the rule more quickly, according to an April report from The New York Times. “You ought to be working on this regulation all day every day,” the Times quotes Miller as saying. “It should be the first thought you have when you wake up. And it should be the last thought you have before you go to bed. And sometimes you shouldn’t go to bed.”As White House officials scrambled to complete the regulation’s initial draft version last year, they made clear to federal agencies that the decision to propose the drastic change to how immigration law is enforced had already been made. Agencies were discouraged from arguing against the central thrust of the policy, according to the emails obtained by ProPublica.“Please do not worry about non-substantive line edits,” a White House official, whose name is redacted, wrote in bold type, in July 2018 and again in September. “Please recognize, also, that the decision of whether to propose expanding the definition of public charge, broadly, has been made at a very high level and will not be changing.”

233,Hearing About Trump Every Day and ‘Trump Overload’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/hearing-about-trump-everyday-and-trump-overload/,"Mhm, and you’d better believe that’s intentional.
Part of it is just straight-up narcissism: Donald Trump needs to be perpetually in the spotlight and given to believe that people love him. He’s turned his ongoing battle with the media into a positive for him: it’s the old “If they’re shooting at you, you must be doing something right” approach, and he sees a lot of people gunning for him (metaphorically, of course). Negative attention is still attention, and as is often the case with the extreme Right, they see any reaction by the Left as a positive for them.
Beyond that, though, it’s Trump’s way of staying relevant: in a political arena where he lacks any experience, understanding or competence, the best way for him to stay front-and-center is to comment on everything. This does expose the aforementioned inexperience, particularly since he has a tendency of expressing thoughts that just don’t mesh with reality, but those will be greeted with exasperation by the opposition, and enthusiastic support from his followers. Trump, in that regard, can’t lose.

When you talk about “Trump overload,” that is important: it is, in truth, part of what’s kept him in office. Any singular scandal or inappropriate action on his part would normally be sufficient to put his presidency into jeopardy — but we get so many of them on a day-to-day basis that people have stopped caring. Trump said something racist? What else is new? He offended a foreign ally? Business as usual in the Oval Office then. We ultimately all get afflicted with a sense of resigned apathy: we expect the worst from him, and frequently get it.

Of course, if he weren’t being shielded from the consequences by Senate Republicans, he’d be out of office by now — and that’s frankly only encouraging him. He knows he’s politically bulletproof for the moment, and he genuinely believes that the support of the Republican base is all he’ll need to secure re-election: so he has, in effect, absolutely no reason to act in a presidential fashion, and every reason to continue with his outrageous, ill-advised and childish behavior: because it gets him the attention he craves and doesn’t cost him anything politically.
The downside for him is that I think many Americans are genuinely fed up with the constant controversies and scandals: most of them just want Trump to shut up and do his duty as president. He’s fully opposed by Democrats, but it’s the moderate independents in the middle (which are the largest demographic in the United States) that are going to pull away from him as a consequence of his behavior — and he doesn’t help himself in this regard. It could very well cost him the 2020 election because most would simply prefer a president who doesn’t act like an attention-seeking four-year-old hopped up on sugar.
For the moment, however, it’s worked to give him some protection against scrutiny: at the end of the day, we’re so used to seeing him spout off nonsense that many of us have largely stopped listening or paying him any mind, and that’s when a person of Trump’s nature is at their most dangerous. Complacency and apathy could be a problem…

234,How Amazon and Silicon Valley Seduced the Pentagon,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/how-amazon-and-silicon-valley-seduced-the-pentagon/,"Originally Published on Propublica.
On Aug. 8, 2017, Roma Laster, a Pentagon employee responsible for policing conflicts of interest, emailed an urgent warning to the chief of staff of then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Several department employees had arranged for Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, to be sworn into an influential Pentagon advisory board despite the fact that, in the year since he’d been nominated, Bezos had never completed a required background check to obtain a security clearance.Mattis was about to fly to the West Coast, where he would personally swear Bezos in at Amazon’s headquarters before moving on to meetings with executives from Google and Apple. Soon phone calls and emails began bouncing around the Pentagon. Security clearances are no trivial matter to defense officials; they exist to ensure that people with access to sensitive information aren’t, say, vulnerable to blackmail and don’t have conflicts of interest. Laster also contended that it was a “noteworthy exception” for Mattis to perform the ceremony. Secretaries of defense, she wrote, don’t hold swearing-in events.
Laster’s alarms triggered fear among Pentagon brass that Mattis would be seen as doing a special favor for Bezos, which could put him in hot water with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly proclaimed his antipathy to Bezos, mainly because of his ownership of The Washington Post. The swearing-in was canceled only hours before it was scheduled to occur. (This episode, never previously reported, is based on interviews with six people familiar with the matter. An Amazon spokesperson said the company was told that Bezos did not need a security clearance and that the company provided all requested information.)Despite the cancellation, Bezos met with Mattis that day. They talked about leadership and military history, then moved on to Amazon’s sales pitch on why the Defense Department should make a radical shift in its computing. Amazon wanted the department to abandon its hodgepodge of 2,215 data centers, located in various Pentagon facilities and run using different systems by an array of different companies, and let Amazon replace that with cloud service: computing power provided over the internet, all of it running on Amazon’s servers.That vision is now well on its way to becoming a reality. The Pentagon is preparing to award a $10 billion, 10-year contract to move its information technology systems to the cloud. Amazon’s cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is the biggest provider of cloud services in the country and also the company’s profit engine: It accounted for 58.7% of Amazon’s operating income last year. AWS has been the favorite to emerge with the Pentagon contract.Known as JEDI, for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, the project has been the subject of accusations of favoritism. Two spurned bidders have launched unsuccessful bid protests and one of them, Oracle, filed and lost a lawsuit. Meanwhile, there’s an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon’s inspector general.The DOD defends JEDI. The agency’s decision-makers have “always placed the interests of the warfighter first and have acted without bias, prejudice, or self-interest,” DOD spokesperson Elissa Smith said in a statement. “The same cannot be said of all parties to the debate over JEDI.”What’s happened at the Pentagon extends past the JEDI contract. It’s a story of how some of America’s biggest tech companies used a little-known advisory board, some aggressive advocacy by a few billionaires and some unofficial lobbying to open a backdoor into the Pentagon. And so, no matter who wins the JEDI contract, one winner is already clear: Silicon Valley. The question is no longer whether a technology giant will emerge with the $10 billion prize, but rather which technology giant (or giants) will.There are certainly benefits. The Pentagon’s technological infrastructure does indeed need to be modernized. But there may also be costs. Silicon Valley has pushed for the Pentagon to adopt its technology and its move-fast-and-break-things ethos. The result, according to interviews with more than three dozen current and former DOD officials and tech executives, has been internal clashes and a tortured process that has combined the hype of tech with the ethical morass of the Washington industry-government revolving door.
Laster did her best to enforce the rules. She would challenge the Pentagon’s cozy relationship not only with Bezos, but with Google’s Eric Schmidt, the chairman of the defense board that Bezos sought to join. The ultimate resolution? Laster was shunted aside. She was removed from the innovation board in November 2017 (but remains at the Defense Department). “Roma was removed because she insisted on them following the rules,” said a former DOD official knowledgeable about her situation.Laster filed a grievance, which was denied. “I’ve been betrayed by an organization I joined when I was 17 years old,” said Laster, who is 54. “This is an organization built on loyalty, dedication and patriotism. Unfortunately, it is kind of one-way.”Other criticism, from Amazon’s rivals and the press, has centered on the actions of several DOD workers who had previously worked directly or indirectly for Amazon and have since returned to the private sector. The most important of those employees, Sally Donnelly — a former outside strategist for Amazon who had become one of Mattis’ top aides — helped give Amazon officials access to Mattis in intimate settings, an opportunity that most defense contractors don’t enjoy. Donnelly organized a private dinner, never reported before, for Mattis, Bezos, herself and Amazon’s top government-sales executive at a Washington restaurant, DBGB, on Jan. 17, 2018. The dinner occurred just as the DOD was finalizing draft bid specifications for JEDI. (Asked about the dinner and several others like it, the DOD’s Smith said: “One of the department’s priorities is to reform the way DOD does business. As part of this reform, leaders are expected to engage with industry — in a full and open manner within legal boundaries — to find ways to reform our business practices and build a more lethal force.” A spokesperson for AWS said the dinner “had nothing to do with the JEDI procurement, and those implying otherwise either are misinformed or disappointed competitors trying to distract with innuendo vs competing fairly with their technical capabilities.”)
Such meetings aren’t illegal, but they undermine public trust in defense contracting, said Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law and one of the nation’s leading experts on government-contracting law. “This is a particularly serious example of the revolving door among Pentagon officials and defense contractors, which has been problematic in recent years and is getting worse under the Trump administration,” he said.In July, Trump expressed concerns about the process and whether it was skewed in Amazon’s favor. Early this month, his new defense secretary, Mark Esper, announced a fresh review, which will delay the selection of a winner. The judge in the JEDI-related case ruled in favor of the government but nonetheless summed up the process as containing conflict-of-interest allegations that were “certainly sufficient to raise eyebrows” and a “constant gravitational pull on agency employees by technology behemoths.”The board that Bezos almost joined — called the Defense Innovation Board — was launched in 2016 by Ashton Carter, the last defense secretary in the Obama administration. Carter worried that the Pentagon’s information technology was falling behind. He recruited a collection of tech luminaries, including Schmidt, then the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, by appealing to their patriotism and enticing them with the proposition that the DOD needed the insight and culture of Silicon Valley. Of course, the Pentagon also has an annual infotech budget of $38 billion, and what tech CEO could resist offering products and services to solve the department’s problems?Schmidt, the chairman of the innovation board, embraced the mission. In the spring and summer of 2016, he embarked, with fellow board members, on a series of visits to Pentagon operations around the world. Schmidt visited a submarine base in San Diego, an aircraft carrier off the coast of the United Arab Emirates and Creech Air Force Base, located deep in the Nevada desert near Area 51.Inside the drone operations center at Creech, according to three people familiar with the trip, Schmidt observed video as a truck in a contested zone somewhere was surveilled by a Predator drone and annihilated. It was a mesmerizing display of the U.S. military’s lethal reach.
Yet as Schmidt and his colleagues studied the control panels and displays, they felt like they were witnessing technology frozen in the 1970s. He began asking questions about the challenges of controlling drones thousands of miles away. One operator complained that he had to use his joystick to toggle quickly between systems and screens, turning off one feed to use another. He had to do all of this while simultaneously flying the drone and trying to keep his attention on a target that was frequently in motion.A little later, on the operations floor, Schmidt watched as dozens of people monitored video feeds from drones around the globe. One of the visitors noted that computers using recognition software and machine learning could much more efficiently and accurately perform the majority of these tasks.A little more than a year after Schmidt’s visit, Google won a $17 million subcontract in a project called Maven to help the military use image recognition software to identify drone targets — exactly the kind of function that Schmidt witnessed at Creech. (Schmidt declined to be interviewed. A person close to the innovation board said he was unaware of his company’s involvement in Maven. Google, which has funded ProPublica projects on voting and video journalism in recent years, declined to comment on the record.)Schmidt’s influence, already strong under Carter, only grew when Mattis arrived as defense secretary. Schmidt’s travel privileges at the DOD, which required painstaking approval from the agency’s chief of staff for each stop of every trip, were suddenly unfettered after Schmidt requested carte blanche, according to three sources knowledgeable about the matter. Mattis granted him and the board permission to travel anywhere they wanted and to talk to anyone at the DOD on all but the most secret programs.
Such access is unheard-of for executives or directors of companies that sell to the government, say three current and former DOD officials, both to prevent opportunities for bribery or improper influence and to ensure that one company does not get advantages over others. “Mattis changed the rules of engagement and the muscularity of the innovation board went from zero to 60,” said a person who has served on Pentagon advisory boards. “There’s a lot of opportunity for mischief.”In a written statement, the DOD denied that Mattis extended Schmidt’s privileges, characterizing them as “no more and no less” than when Carter was defense secretary. As for Mattis, his former press secretary, Dana White, speaking on his behalf, said: “In order to do their job, all members of the Defense Innovation Board had full access to the department and its entities. Secretary Mattis insisted on it. He fully leveraged their unique experience to ensure DOD adapted and gained maximum advantage over the rising threats of near-peer competitors.”Over the next months, Schmidt and two other board members with Google ties would continue flying all over the country, visiting Pentagon installations and meeting with DOD officials, sessions that no other company could attend. It’s hard to reconstruct what occurred in many of those meetings, since they were private. On one occasion, Schmidt quizzed a briefer about which cloud service provider was being used for a data project, according to a memo that Laster prepared after the briefing. When the briefer told him that Amazon handled the business, Schmidt asked if they’d considered other cloud providers. Laster’s memo flagged Schmidt’s inquiry as a “point of concern,” given that he was the chairman of a major cloud provider.The DOD became unusually deferential to Schmidt. He preferred to travel on his personal jet, and he would ferry fellow board members with him. But that created a problem for his handlers: DOD employees are not permitted to ride on private planes. Still, the staff at the board didn’t want to inconvenience Schmidt by making him wait for his department support team to arrive on commercial flights. So, according to a source knowledgeable about the board’s spending, on at least one occasion the department requisitioned military aircraft at a cost of $25,000 an hour to transport its employees to meet Schmidt on his tour. (The DOD’s spokesperson said employees did this because “there were no commercial flights available.”)
The fact that such unusual access was granted to a board member who was a DOD vendor raised alarm, according to current and former Pentagon employees. As she had in the Bezos episode, Laster took action. She was a former Marine who’d been a military police officer in the U.S. force in Somalia in the 1990s. Her official title was designated federal officer for the Defense Innovation Board. Laster’s job was to make sure that members’ conduct was ethical and in accordance with laws, regulations and rules. Blunt and direct, she was hardly a pushover. But Laster had never encountered tech billionaires before, much less ones empowered by the head of her agency.The trouble started after Laster sought a clarification of how to carry out Mattis’ sweeping travel directive. She was concerned that it could expose the department to accusations of giving vendors an unfair edge. Three members of the board worked directly or indirectly for Google and two for United Technologies, a major defense contractor.Schmidt responded by threatening to go over her head to Mattis, according to her grievance. She was told to stand down and never again speak to Schmidt. According to the grievance, her boss told her, “Mr. Schmidt was a billionaire and would never accept pushback, warnings or limits.”The Schmidt episode captured the tension that had emerged inside the department. To one Silicon Valley supporter, it was a “textbook example of the bureaucracy trying to slow down progress and change using rules, rules, rules.” To Michael Bayer, the former chairman of another Pentagon advisory board, where he had worked with Laster, she was a person of “extraordinary character” who was working hard to make sure the board “did the right thing.”It would be hard to find a purer embodiment of the proverbial revolving door — or a stealth influencer — than Sally Donnelly. For the past dozen years she has shuttled between the DOD and consulting firms, including at least once with Amazon as a client, that seek to influence the department. During her most recent government stint, Donnelly, 59, came to be viewed as the “fairy godmother” of the Big Tech advocates in the department, as one Pentagon official put it to ProPublica.Donnelly is known as a superb crafter of narratives, a person who can present ideas in persuasive ways. She honed those skills in her first career, as a reporter at Time magazine, where, among other things, she covered the Pentagon and wrote glowingly of Mattis. Donnelly spent 20 years at the newsweekly before moving to the DOD for the first time in 2007. She worked for the then-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, then later for Mattis, including while he oversaw the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as the head of Central Command.In 2012, Donnelly departed and opened her own consulting firm, SBD Advisors. “Our team offers guidance and stealth strategies,” its website boasted, according to a 2014 article in Politico, “ensuring that clients benefit from the results of our campaigns while outwardly they are under-the-radar.” SBD’s clients included Amazon, Uber, Bloomberg, Palantir and others.Donnelly was a master at quietly cultivating a network, one that straddled the permeable line between government and industry. Carter rented an office at the firm before he became Obama’s defense secretary, and a Politico story listed him as a SBD adviser. (During Carter’s tenure as secretary, Donnelly worked as a DOD consultant.) SBD’s other high-profile generals and defense-connected figures included Mullen, former director of national intelligence Dennis Blair and Michael Flynn, the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief and national security adviser who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.By 2015, Donnelly’s business had announced a new focus. SBD now specialized in “bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and Washington, DC,” its website declared, by “facilitating engagements between the technology and defense sectors.” The next year her firm started advising Amazon Web Services on how to land DOD contracts.In January 2017, Donnelly rejoined the department after successfully shepherding Mattis through the Senate confirmation process. Her title, senior adviser, understated her influence. She emerged as one of the most powerful people in the leadership of the Pentagon, according to numerous DOD staffers. She guided Mattis on politics (which was relatively new terrain for him), relations with the White House and dealing with the press.Donnelly also helped the defense secretary connect with outside companies. She helped arrange not only the January 2018 dinner between Bezos and Mattis, but also a previously reported private dinner with Mattis and Teresa Carlson, the head of the AWS division that sells services to governments, in March 2017 in London. (A host of that gathering told The Wall Street Journal that cloud computing was not discussed and that the purpose of the dinner was to talk about a charity involving wounded veterans.) The same year, at Donnelly’s behest, AWS’ Carlson met with several of Mattis’ top aides. People familiar with the matter say they discussed a possible job for Carlson at the Pentagon. No offer was made. (A source close to Carlson said such a job “would not have been of interest.”)
A lawyer for Donnelly, Michael Levy, said she “always adhered to all ethical and legal obligations and acted in the best interest of the national security of the United States.” He added that she played no role in the JEDI contract. “To suggest otherwise … reflects an absence of even the most rudimentary understanding of the government contracting process.”A veteran Marine general, Mattis was initially perceived as skeptical of what Silicon Valley was selling. He knew the flesh-and-blood realities of war and believed in giving autonomy to commanders on the ground. In his mind, anything that reinforced Pentagon leaders’ desire to micromanage events halfway across the globe was problematic. Technology, he believed, could make matters worse.But Schmidt was an effective advocate for the power of big data, which he argued had become as important a strategic resource as oil. And he emphasized that the need for technological improvement was urgent: China was rapidly improving. In June 2017, at a private lunch in a Pentagon conference room, Schmidt told him Google’s lead over China in artificial intelligence technology had shrunk from five years to six months. “Mr. Secretary, they’re at your heels,” Schmidt said, according to three people familiar with the lunch. “You need to take decisive action now.”Schmidt wanted the department to adopt a Silicon Valley philosophy that emphasized innovation, taking risks and moving fast. Among his recommendations: embrace cloud computing. In the summer of 2017, Mattis decided to investigate firsthand. He departed on a tour that would include visits to Amazon and Google headquarters and a one-on-one with Apple CEO Tim Cook.At Amazon, despite the tempest about Bezos joining the innovation board, Mattis and the CEO hit it off. The two talked together for about an hour. Mattis gave a pithy sweep of lessons from military history and expressed his view on the perils of overreliance on technology. He noted how the British Navy, once famous for its derring-do, nearly lost the World War I battle of Jutland when ship captains hesitated, waiting for flag signals from their fleet commander.After the meeting, Bezos and Mattis walked to another conference room, where AWS executives made their case that the company’s cloud products offer better security than traditional data centers, according to three people who attended. As evidence, they noted that the Central Intelligence Agency had embarked on a $600 million, 10-year cloud contract with Amazon in 2013 and, they said, it was working.To ensure that Mattis could visualize the impact Amazon’s technology could have on an actual battlefield, staffers placed on the conference room table a “Snowball Edge,” a suitcase-sized device with lots of storage that allowed soldiers in remote environments to quickly process information.One of Mattis’ last meetings on the trip seemed to tip him into the camp of the cloud advocates. He met with venture capitalists, including Marc Andreessen, an influential Silicon Valley figure who first made his name as the creator of the Netscape browser a quarter-century ago. Andreessen was a booster of Amazon. “You need to get to the cloud,” he told Mattis. “You’d be stupid not to.”Something seemed to click inside Mattis. He told his staff to begin preparing a memo laying out how the DOD would shift its computing to the cloud.The Pentagon’s cloud initiative ultimately ended up being led by Chris Lynch, the head of Defense Digital Service. DDS was no ordinary unit; it was a corps of software engineers hired from Google, Amazon and other tech companies to “challenge the status quo, burdensome policies and established bureaucracies in an effort to streamline DOD’s ability to introduce modern software development, tools and practices,” according to a department spokesperson. And Lynch himself was no ordinary government employee. As a teenager, he had been arrested and expelled from his Ohio high school after he and some friends called in a bomb threat as a joke. But he grew up, earned his high school degree, worked at Microsoft and then ran a series of startups. At 43, he wore hoodies to an office dominated by starched white shirts and still considered himself an insurgent, a point he conveyed by posting a sign reading “The Rebel Alliance” outside the entrance to his group’s office; the name also reflected his obsession with Star Wars. (His team came up with the acronym JEDI for the cloud project.)Lynch had a vision of how the Pentagon’s cloud initiative should work: a single DOD-wide cloud run by one provider that would allow the agency to shutter all but the most secret of its data centers. Having one cloud would be ultra-efficient, he said. It would allow programmers to deliver instant software fixes to the entire department, rather than multiple divisions needing to wait weeks for an outside contractor to come by in person.
Lynch also believed the department lacked the expertise to manage multiple vendors, each with its own idiosyncrasies. Better to give the entire agency one provider. And as he saw it, only three cloud companies in the U.S. were capable of that mission: Amazon, Microsoft and Google.Some in the Pentagon believed that Lynch’s plan presented its own risk. They thought that putting all of the agency’s data in one company’s system made it more vulnerable, not less, than having it stored with multiple vendors. They also worried such an approach would stifle competition and create a huge monopoly.But Lynch had an advantage in the fight: Donnelly. She obtained full access to the Pentagon front office for Lynch and secured a “letter of marque” for him, a written statement of support from Mattis that put the weight of the agency’s chief behind him.Amazon often seemed to have allies close at hand. For example, the deputy defense secretary sometimes used his chief of staff, Tony DeMartino, as a point man to the key committee on JEDI. DeMartino had been managing director of Donnelly’s consulting firm, where he’d had Amazon as a client. He was warned to be “vigilant and consult” with ethics lawyers before involving himself in matters related to Amazon. But even after the warning, DeMartino repeatedly participated in the cloud-related matters, according to emails submitted by Oracle in its lawsuit against the government, as well as emails obtained by ProPublica and interviews with current and former Pentagon officials. For example, one November 2017 email reviewed by ProPublica, which was copied to Donnelly, shows DeMartino suggested a “huddle” with the new head of the Pentagon’s cloud executive steering group to discuss the man’s responsibilities. Later, after DeMartino was no longer serving the deputy secretary, he asked to remain “linked into” the cloud initiative. A contracting officer who examined DeMartino’s role concluded that his actions hadn’t affected the JEDI process since DeMartino’s role was “ministerial and perfunctory.” (A person in DeMartino’s camp insists that his only activity on JEDI was blocking a “stupid acronym” — C3PO — from being inserted in a larger memo.)A second former Amazon employee would spark more controversy. Deap Ubhi, a former AWS employee who worked for Lynch, was tasked with gathering marketing information to make the case for a single cloud inside the DOD. Around the same time that he started working on JEDI, Ubhi began talking with AWS about rejoining the company. As his work on JEDI deepened, so did his job negotiations. Six days after he received a formal offer from Amazon, Ubhi recused himself from JEDI, fabricating a story that Amazon had expressed an interest in buying a startup company he owned. A contracting officer who investigated found enough evidence that Ubhi’s conduct violated conflict of interest rules to refer the matter to the inspector general, but concluded that his conduct did not corrupt the process. (Ubhi, who now works in AWS’ commercial division, declined comment through a company spokesperson.)Ubhi worsened the impression by making ill-advised public statements while still employed by the DOD. In a tweet, he described himself as “once an Amazonian, always an Amazonian.”By the time the draft JEDI bid was formally unveiled in March 2018, rumors had begun surfacing in trade publications that the specifications had been written with Amazon in mind. For example, the bid required that the JEDI contract could not account for more than half of the provider’s cloud data load. And it required that the provider have at least three physical data centers, each separated by more than 150 miles. Only a tiny handful of companies could fulfill those mandates.Many tech companies were furious. Indeed, the only major cloud computing company that defended JEDI was Amazon. The harshest reaction came from IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, which would form the nucleus of a coalition that would work to stop JEDI. “This one-size-fits-all idea is, I think, limited to JEDI and promoted by Amazon, because it fits Amazon’s needs,” said Ken Glueck, Oracle’s top Washington executive.The DOD’s spokesperson said, “The requirements were not designed around any one provider.” An Amazon spokesperson said that “from day one, we’ve competed for JEDI on the breadth and depth of our services, and their corresponding security and operational performance.”Oracle responded by using its own access. As first reported by Bloomberg, Oracle arranged for its co-CEO, Safra Catz, to attend a private dinner in April 2018 with Trump and Peter Thiel, a founder of defense firm Palantir and a Trump ally. Catz told Trump she thought the JEDI specifications had been written so that only Amazon could win, according to a person familiar with the conversation and Bloomberg.
Only four companies submitted bids for JEDI. Google had already withdrawn from the bidding, citing its belief that the project should be split among multiple providers. The decision came after its own employees protested the company’s participation in Maven, expressing opposition to the idea that their technology would be used to help kill people. Two bidders — IBM and Oracle — were eliminated after they failed to meet the bid requirements. That has left only Amazon and Microsoft still standing in the JEDI competition.Both IBM and Oracle filed protests. IBM’s protest was dismissed and Oracle’s was denied by the Government Accountability Office. Oracle sued the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, asserting JEDI had been tainted by conflicts of interest. The judge in the case ruled against Oracle. He agreed with the contracting officer that Oracle lost the bid on the merits and that any “errors and omissions” were “not significant and did not give AWS a competitive advantage.”Oracle did not give up. The company hired former members of the Trump administration and made its case to allies on key congressional committees. Largely as a result, the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee blocked the DOD from spending money on JEDI until it demonstrated it was using multiple cloud vendors.Then, in July, Trump himself got involved, saying he was considering intervening in JEDI. Soon after, the new secretary of defense, Mark Esper (a former chief lobbyist for Raytheon), requested another review.Much of the information that has surfaced in the press about JEDI is the product of investigations performed by Oracle and its lawyers. Meanwhile, PowerPoint presentations and investigative reports containing allegations of all sorts of byzantine chicanery by Amazon began circulating last year. By the spring of 2019, multiple corporate interests had deployed private teams to investigate their rivals and DOD officials.The Pentagon’s inspector general continues to investigate, according to a spokesperson, including “whether current or former DOD officials committed misconduct relating to the JEDI acquisition, such as whether any had any conflicts of interest related to their involvement in the acquisition process.”The claims and investigations have left JEDI shrouded in uncertainty. The project might not survive in its current form, according to people knowledgeable about the DOD, but there’s little doubt that the agency will move its computing to the cloud in one form or another.As for Donnelly, she left government again last year. A going-away party was thrown for her at the Pentagon. Jared Kushner and former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn attended. Today, Cohn is the chairman of the advisory board of a new firm that Donnelly has opened, Pallas Advisors, which she founded along with Tony DeMartino, the former DOD political appointee and ex-strategy consultant for SBD.Pallas describes itself as a “strategic advisory firm” that provides “insight into how governments think and operate.” According to a person familiar with the matter, one of Pallas’ staffers, Robert Daigle — who had previously worked on the JEDI project at the DOD — turned up in early August in the offices of at least one U.S. senator. Daigle was accompanied by Chris Lynch, who has left the DOD and founded a company, Rebellion Defense, that is seeking defense contracts relating to artificial intelligence. (Rebellion’s board members include Eric Schmidt.)Lynch and Daigle were pushing a familiar agenda from a new vantage point: They wanted to explain why a single-cloud makes sense for the Defense Department. And if their own companies got some new opportunities as a result, it went without saying, that would be just fine with them.

235,Could Republicans Come Together on Background Checks With Democrats Supporting Voter ID?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/could-republicans-come-together-on-background-checks-with-democrats-supporting-voter-id/,"Politics are supposed to be about working together. About compromise. You and I can work this out together right now.
I’ll concede your constitutional point that the 2nd Amendment prohibits us (as legislators which we both are in this scenario) from making law that infringes on the right of “the people” to keep and bear arms. I’ll even, for the purpose of this important compromise, not give you a bunch of hell about the meaning of the militia clause.
Now you will concede that it is equally constitutionally clear in the 24th Amendment that no government fee can impede a citizen’s right to vote.

See? I’m hearing your constitutional argument and agreeing, you are hearing mine and agreeing that the 24th Amendment does indeed say you can’t keep people from voting based on something that has a government fee involved. (Yes, this is the problem liberals have with voter IDs, not race. It’s a constitutional problem. I know you don’t hear that enough on Fox News. They keep telling you it’s all about identity politics… sorry, it’s not. It’s about the Constitution, which conservatives claim to be all about preserving.)
Now. We, you and I, submit a great piece of joint legislation.
We agree to define background checks clearly enough that they do not infringe on the normal right of everyday Americans to keep and bear arms, but are strong enough to keep firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill, terrorists, convicted criminals, and we can negotiate on the rest.
We jointly agree that in order to protect elections Voter ID is important, but since the 24th Amendment is as enshrined as the 2nd we agree that this picture ID should be freely and without problem or cost issued to every citizen who registers to vote, and that that ID is accepted without question at all polling places. All cost of maintaining any database needed to confirm identification will be covered by the federal government.
See? You not only get protection of the 2nd Amendment from overly aggressive background checks, but you also get the Voter IDs you so desperately want in the same agreement… in a way no Democrat will have a problem with!

Wait. Why is the right saying this sucks? Why don’t they like voter ID that doesn’t violate the 24th? Is it because Voter ID laws aren’t really about election security?
Yeah. It’s totally because Voter ID laws aren’t really about election security.
Don’t agree? Prove it. Advocate for Voter ID laws like this one.

236,Bibles but Not Textbooks: Trump’s Tariff Exemptions Pick Winners and Losers,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/bibles-but-not-textbooks-trumps-tariff-exemptions-pick-winners-and-losers/,"Originally Published on Propublica.
President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade brinksmanship has split the American economy into new castes of winners and losers, with few consistent criteria defining who ends up in which group — as illustrated by the $2 billion in products that won exemptions last week from a new round of China tariffs.Bibles and other religious texts got a pass after U.S. publishers and Christian groups argued that tariffs would infringe upon the freedom to worship around the globe.Salmon and cod — caught in Alaska and processed in China — won an exemption after the state’s Republican senators successfully argued that tariffs would pose an “economic security” risk to Alaska’s fishing industry.Chemicals used in fracking escaped tariffs after the oil and gas industry argued that taxing them would threaten America’s “energy dominance.”
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative carved out those products from an original list of $300 billion based on what it called “health, safety, national security and other factors.” About half of the original list was delayed until December in order to get past the holiday season, but after that, importers will pay 10% of the value of whatever they bring in from China.Although the companies that won relief may not be markedly different than the interests favored by other Republican administrations, this cycle of tariffs and exemptions is happening faster and at a larger scale than any remotely similar exercise in the past, giving far more companies reason to protest.Take religious texts like the Bible and the Quran, which were the only kind of publication exempted by trade regulators. Other written works, from pulp fiction to textbooks, were denied clemency.In the weeks following USTR’s announcement of a new batch of tariffs ostensibly justified by China’s violation of intellectual property law — this one covering a huge swath of finished goods, since duties had already been assessed on most kinds of intermediate materials — Christian publishers and religious groups made their case for a reprieve.In letters and testimony, they argued that China had become America’s primary source of Bibles because of its unparalleled proficiency in printing the 800,000-word text, which requires thinner paper and often more ornate, hand-stitched bindings. The U.S. imported almost $140 million worth of religious texts in 2018, 67.3% of which came from China, according to Panjiva, the supply-chain research unit at S&P Global Market Intelligence, a commodities data provider. The world’s largest producer of Bibles, China’s Amity Printing, said it produced 14.15 million copies in 2017.Those volumes are already more expensive than the average beach read. Biblica, a nonprofit that gives Bibles away around the world, testified that a tariff on religious books would “dramatically affect” the number of Bibles it was able to donate, “impacting the religious freedom of individuals in countries where Bible access is limited and often nonexistent.”Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the 15.2 million member Southern Baptist Convention, wrote that a tariff on Bibles would require “higher prices incompatible with the high and consistent demand for Bibles in the United States” and affect “all Christians’ ability to exercise their religious freedom in the United States.”The USTR’s decision wasn’t all good news for churches and religious publishers, however. They produce and consume plenty of religious-themed books that wouldn’t qualify under a strict interpretation of the exemption. Besides, most of them urged a return to the long-standing practice of avoiding burdensome taxation on all publications on First Amendment grounds.“All books should really be exempt, because that’s been the tradition of the United States,” said Stan Jantz, executive director of the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association. “It was never an intention to only be the Bibles. If anything, I would hope the Bible would help them open up and see the value of all books.”
That was also the hope of independent publishers and bookstores, which already operate on thin margins. Dan Reynolds, CEO of Workman Publishing, which has several nonfiction imprints as well as a line of children’s books, says the focus on Bibles was part of a conscious approach.“We strategized when this started to happen about which parts of our business would get the attention of the administration, as well as which products that are reliant on Chinese production, with the hope that by making our case with Bibles and children’s books primarily, that that would make all books exempted,” Reynolds said in an interview. “So we’re partially victorious, but it didn’t help all the other categories.”The tariffs for children’s books were pushed to December, but Reynolds isn’t sure what his company will do after that. Chinese printers are especially good at producing affordable children’s books with all kinds of bells and whistles, like pop-ups and textures. The fixed budgets of schools and libraries won’t expand to pay for tariffs, so Reynolds said he’ll probably sell fewer books. And if he has to move production out of China, he said, he’ll keep costs down by dialing back some of the fun features.The situation is perhaps more difficult for small bookstores, which don’t have the cash on hand — or the space — to stock up on inventory before the year-end holidays. Jamie Fiocco, president of the American Booksellers Association and owner of Flyleaf Books in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, is resigned to the fact that religious works were protected while others were not.
“I think it’s a statement about the environment we’re working in these days,” Fiocco said.Books aren’t the only product where the USTR has had to make tough choices about which industries to favor and which to leave hanging. (The agency did not respond to a request for further explanation of why it exempted the products it did.)The roughly two dozen product categories that escaped tariffs included frozen cod, salmon and haddock, which are often harvested in Alaska and sent to China for processing into fillets and nuggets that are sold in grocery stores and restaurants. A tariff on those reimports would have hurt the fishing industry. Under pressure from Alaska’s congressional delegation, they had been dropped from previous rounds of duties but ended up included again in the fourth batch, which meant having the argument all over again.A joint letter from Alaska Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Rep. Don Young referred to their “many discussions” with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and it warned him that failing to exempt salmon and cod would carry consequences. “You risk losing critical congressional support if your actions end up having the result of targeting and harming some of the very Americans we know you want to help,” they wrote.In response to a question about what seafood tariffs had to do with health, safety or national security, Murkowski spokeswoman Hannah Ray highlighted the part of the USTR notice that said “other factors” could come into play.“Beyond those explicitly listed, there are additional factors that USTR could consider in deciding to remove items from its final list,” Ray wrote. “This administration broadly interprets ‘national security’ to include domestic economic security. Senator Murkowski shares the administration’s desire to ensure fair and reciprocal trade.”The lawmakers weren’t against all fish tariffs, however. They advocated for continuing to include pollock, a divisive issue in the seafood industry. There are more American companies that process pollock and also more Russian pollock that comes into the U.S. after processing in China, creating a stronger domestic lobby for taxing imports. But resellers and restaurant chains complain that all tariffs make food more expensive — in this case, pollock fish fingers.“Compared to the range of outcomes that we could’ve had, it’s certainly better, but it’s still overall a very poor outcome in my opinion,” said Matt Fass, president of the Williamsburg, Virginia-based distributor Maritime Products International. “A couple of the species have been exempted, which is a good thing. The largest volume species has not been — that’s pollock. … Everything is immediately higher priced when the tariffs hit.”
Beyond fish and Bibles, USTR also spared several types of minerals with defense applications that would meet the “national security” criterion.That’s also convenient for American industrial conglomerates. For example, zirconium goes into nuclear fuel rods used in the Navy’s submarines and aircraft carriers, according to testimony from Allegheny Technologies and BWX Technologies, which supply zirconium to the military. But it’s also used for civilian airplanes built by aerospace companies.Other exempted products seem to only be priorities for powerful industries. Aluminum oxide, for example, is critical for steel manufacturers, who had been protected by earlier rounds of tariffs on imported steel but could have been hurt by subsequent duties on chemicals they need in order to produce domestic steel. Various forms of barium are used as a stabilizing additive to fracking fluids, and companies including the oil field services firm Halliburton testified that using alternative products would decrease drilling productivity. Fifty-three-foot shipping containers are essential for trucking and rail transportation, and big companies like J.B Hunt and CSX said that tariffing them would make all kinds of freight shipments more expensive.No industry, however, got everything that it wanted in the exemptions. Take the juvenile products industry: Child car seats were waved through, but cribs and baby gates stayed on the list. Or oil and gas: Despite the reprieve on barium, tariffs remain in place on more than 100 industrial components used in both offshore and surface drilling, and the steel tariffs have pushed costs higher on everything.“U.S. energy leadership and global competitiveness are also threatened by the ongoing trade dispute with China as U.S. natural gas and oil exports serve as targets for retaliation,” a spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute said in an emailed statement.And of course, all of this could change in a flash. Previously exempted categories could be put on yet another list, as several were in this latest round, leaving business heads spinning.
“It just has gone so quickly, and it’s so volatile,” said Angela Bole, CEO of the Independent Book Publishers Association. “Everything was thrown in. It was like dropping a house on a fly.”

237,CNN Debate Night 2 Decided Clorox is More Important Than Guns,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/cnn-debate-night-2-decided-clorox-is-more-important-than-guns/,"The second debate night is not as vivid in my memory as we all had dispersed by that point. That’s not to say that certain moments did not stand out to me. I think we all expected Cory Booker to come out of the gates swinging as he needed to in order to have any chance of the infiltrating “The Big Four” (Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders) arena. And given that it’s almost too easy to go after Biden, he certainly did what he needed to do. And I must add, he did not disappoint.

Those on the Biden bandwagon can say that Booker shot himself in the foot by so ferociously going after the leading candidate, but he clearly did not. Biden cannot attach himself to the Obama legacy if, and when convenient — and that seems to be his only card whenever confronted. It needed to be called out. Strategically, can we blame him? Probably not. He’s going to continue doing what he’s done since Day 1: riding the Obama coattails all while saying that he doesn’t want Barack Obama to endorse him. With no endorsement for anyone right now, it is a case where Barack Obama is essentially endorsing Biden until he doesn’t.
So yes, we’re aware of what he’s doing. Because no endorsement by an Obama is an endorsement for Joe Biden. It’s really that simple. And so, supposing Biden will not be a good fit for the presidency, then what was said was exactly what needed to be said, and Booker was the one to say it. Booker is on an upward trajectory. We’ll see what happens. On that point, there are few notions I reject more strongly than Biden being “the only candidate who can beat Trump.” There is a field of candidates more talented and more diverse than we’ve ever seen. And Donald Trump is always going to be an abnormally vulnerable candidate. We need to stop feeding into this narrative, as we otherwise start to create somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy. What is our reasoning here? That Biden is a “centrist”? For a centrist such as myself, I can confidently say that Biden is not the candidate I’m looking for.

And so while we can discuss that to the moon and back, it’s not something I’m inclined to take too much more time talking about. There’s a more pressing issue. As a young person, I will tell you that the most notable part of the second debate night was not Booker going at it with Biden.
It was not Kamala Harris giving an underwhelming performance.
It was not Kirsten Gillibrand joking about “cloroxing the Oval Office.”
It was the fact that gun violence was not mentioned once. It was the fact that you cannot make up for it simply by holding a special forum when you feel the timing is right. This is happening every day and everywhere in this country. This is bigger than Dayton or El Paso. This is bigger than Parkland. This is bigger than any specific or any combination of instances because the fact is, we are losing hundreds of lives in this country each day.
Police violence is gun violence. Suicide by gun is gun violence. We need to acknowledge that all forms of gun violence are not given the same attention, and we need to talk about all forms of gun violence. We also need to address gun violence! We cannot accept silence. And so during the second debate, watching the time tick away, waiting for the gun violence epidemic to be brought up only to be given no mention whatsoever was demoralizing.
In fact, the word “Clorox” was said more times than “guns.”

This is a nonpartisan issue. With no mention of an epidemic perpetuated by corrupt lawmakers in Washington, an epidemic shattering families and communities each and every day, and epidemic that is statistically proven to be avoidable — with no mention of the epidemic until it took two more communities to see their friends and family slaughtered, it only reinforces that this epidemic is not being treated with the urgency it not only deserves but requires.
That’s what I remember.

238,‘Head-Spinning’ Day: GOP’s Conditioning the Base to See Trump’s Erratic Behavior as Normal or Time for 25th Amendment?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/head-spinning-day-gops-conditioning-the-base-to-see-trumps-erratic-behavior-as-normal-or-time-for-25th-amendment/,"It was a day in which the president of the United States backed out at the last minute from a diplomatic trip to Denmark because his overture to purchase Greenland. He reversed himself–and then unreversed himself–on serious economic matters. And, finally, he referred to himself in Biblical terms as “The Chosen One.”
What does all of this erratic behavior mean?
“What a Hump Day. Welcome to Meet the Press Daily, I’m Chuck Todd here in Washington. And welcome to a day when we do feel compelled to tell you again that what is now the norm in Washington is not normal, and in many ways it’s very un-American,” MSNBC host Chuck Todd said in opening his Wednesday program. “I can’t believe I have to say it, but it is not normal, nor is it American to call Jewish-Americans disloyal if they somehow vote for the Democrats. It is not normal, let alone very American, to cancel a trip to Denmark because they won’t sell us Greenland. After saying the trip to Denmark had nothing to do with buying Greenland in the first place. I know you got to keep track of your denials from this White House sometimes. It is not normal to deny a tax cut is on the table, then confirm a tax cut is on the table, then again deny it, all in the space of 36 hours and expect any of us to take you seriously. It is not normal that we can’t take the president seriously because taxes and Greenland are just two in a long list of things he’s completely reversed himself on recently. Sometimes he reverses the reversals. Try to keep up with the background check business.

“And maybe the most important and consequential piece of all of this, it is not normal for the Republican Party to enable this, to sit back. By not standing up, speaking out, elected Republicans are allowing the president to keep behaving erratically, abnormally, and in ways that are far from effective. And, oh, by the way, conditioning the entire base of the Republican Party that somehow this is normal behavior,” Todd added. “It is not normal that a head-spinning 30-minute press availability like this has become the norm.”
Progressive commentator Cenk Uygur raised the potential–as has come up occasionally since the earliest days of his presidency–of using the Constitution and its mechanism for removing a president unfit for office.

“I think the president is a lunatic and I think we’ve got to be honest about it. And we’ve got to start talking about the 25th Amendment right now,” Uygur said. “So this guy cancels a diplomatic trip to Denmark because he’s so thin-skinned, he gets triggered so easily, that when Denmark says, no, we’re not going to sell you Greenland, he says my feelings were hurt. Apparently he needs a safe space. In the same 24-hour period, he called himself the second coming of God and the king of Israel. The man is deeply, mentally unstable.
“The Cabinet should convene immediately to discuss the 25th Amendment. And I’m not kidding. The emperor has no clothes. We’re ignoring the elephant in the room: He’s mentally unstable…”

239,Jay Inslee Ends His Bid for the White House,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/jay-inslee-ends-his-bid-for-the-white-house/,"Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington State and former congressman who made the fight against climate change the central point of his campaign, dropped out from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
He made the announcement late Wednesday during an appearance on the MSNBC program The Rachel Maddow Show.
“This show has been so good to me, this is sort of the book ends of my campaign. We started saying climate change had to be the No. 1 job in the United States. I felt good saying that the first days of my campaign. I feel very good saying that now,” Inslee said. “The reason is, this has become more urgent. A billion tons of ice melting in Greenland at the end of the day, we’ve also had so many people inspiring, who want us to act, who have helped me. A hundred thirty thousand people help me in this campaign. It’s become clear I’m not going to be carrying the ball, I’m not going to be president.

“I’ve been fighting climate change for 25 years, and I’ve never been so confident of the ability of Americans to move the ball. I believe we are going to have a candidate to fight this battle, and aspire to the people I’ve met across the country, the young people in the sunrise movement, the climate strikers, these people give me confidence I can move ahead,” he added.
Although he participated in the Democratic presidential debates thus far, Inslee never had gotten much major traction in the crowded field of some two dozen Democratic hopefuls.
Maddow praised Inslee’s climate plan, saying, “It’s more than a road map, it’s an atlas.”
Inslee declined to endorse any other Democratic candidate but said he would support the eventual nominee.
“I’m not endorsing a candidate tonight. I think a number of them have intriguing ideas, but we need all of them to raise their game,” he said. “Here’s the reason: You can argue with politicians but you can’t argue with science. The science is clear. When you have Siberia on fire, which it is today. You have heat waves, it’s 108 in Paris. When we landed in Miami for the debate you moderated, 40,000 acres of a swamp was on fire. We can’t argue with science, we’re going to ask all the candidates to raise their game, I’m going to help them, you’re going to help them, we’re going to beat Donald Trump and beat the climate crisis, I feel good about that.”

240,The Car Seat Industry Helped Delay a Child Safety Regulation — Again,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/the-car-seat-industry-helped-delay-a-child-safety-regulation-again/,"Originally Published on Propublica.
A long-awaited federal safety standard to test child car seats for their effectiveness in side-impact car crashes has been delayed to March 2020 — more than six years since the regulation was first proposed and nearly two decades since Congress urged the Department of Transportation to address the issue.
Attempts to improve car seat safety have bogged down because of a lack of good data on accidents involving children, antiquated technology and industry lobbying. The car seat industry has sought to delay the side-impact rule, arguing that the government should not act without also updating its other safety standards for car seats.
Joseph Colella, the director of child passenger safety for the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, said that having to test multiple types of child car seats under varying crash scenarios with different testing tools would impose an “undue burden” on manufacturers and would lead to price increases for consumers.


 The timetable for setting new rules for child seats has slowed further under the administration of President Donald Trump. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has not had a permanent administrator since January 2017. And Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 directing federal agencies to get rid of two regulations for each new one, a standard that consumer safety advocates say often hurts the ability of regulators to address dangers.
“This isn’t really new that NHTSA is slow to rule,” said Denise Donaldson, the editor of Safe Ride News, a child passenger safety publication. “When you’re already pretty slow and this happens, it just adds to the problem.”
Tim Edwards, a regulatory compliance manager at Dorel Juvenile, a car seat maker, said the company believes that NHTSA plans to update its front-collision standards and put forward the side-impact rule at the same time. If true, that could delay the side-impact standard beyond 2020.
The Department of Transportation provided a cryptic reason for the continued delay in a recent report on its regulatory agenda: “additional research and data analysis necessary.” Some previous reports simply listed “N/A” as the explanation. NHTSA, the agency that regulates car seats, declined to comment.
Motor vehicle crashes are a leading killer of children. Currently, child car seat manufacturers are required to test their seats in a simulated frontal collision. While those kinds of crashes are more common, side-impact crashes, like T-bone collisions, are more dangerous with higher rates of injury.
According to NHTSA, 794 child passengers age 14 and younger died in car crashes in 2017, the latest data available. The number of deaths of child passengers has been about the same since 2013.
NHTSA’s efforts to develop a side-impact standard for child seats began in the early 2000s. But the agency lacked solid data on how and how many children got hurt or died in vehicle accidents. The industry also did not have a crash test dummy that could be used to measure the crash forces experienced by children in real-world side-impact crashes.
In January 2014, NHTSA finally issued a proposed standard that would require all seats designed for children up to 40 pounds (or children in the infant to 4-year-old range) to be tested in a simulated side-impact collision.
 The industry pushed back. In October of that year, Dorel Juvenile wrote in a public comment to NHTSA that releasing the side-impact test rule and the updated frontal test rule at different times would lead to major disruption and simultaneous “synchronization of both standards” would be “preferred.” While the agency was supposed to issue a final standard in 2014 according to the deadline set by Congress, NHTSA has repeatedly postponed the test requirement.
Consumer advocates have raised concerns about the delays. “I don’t understand why anyone hasn’t sued,” said Rena Steinzor, a professor of administrative law at the University of Maryland School of Law. An agency can be sued for unreasonable delays in implementing regulations or for failing to meet a deadline specified by Congress. “Unless they are worried that the Trump NHTSA would come up with a very weak rule,” she added.
A key issue is that the vehicle seat used to test the safety of child car seats in head-on crashes was initially based on the 1974 Chevrolet Impala. It was updated in 2003 to represent car seats of that time, but it is still not considered an accurate model for today’s cars.
While NHTSA has conducted and supported research on what a new seat for head-on tests might look like, the agency hasn’t formally proposed a design or said whether other aspects of the head-on test will change. (NHTSA’s explanation for delaying its proposal for an updated frontal test: “additional coordination necessary.”) That process would require public comment and could take years.


Benjamin Hoffman, the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Injury, Violence and Poison Prevention, said that he is saddened by the continued delays.
“I can’t not be hopeful, but I remain skeptical,” he said. “We’ve been burned too many times.”

241,‘Huge Conspiracy’ that Media Reports Economy Negatively Under Trump,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/huge-conspiracy-that-media-reports-economy-negatively-under-trump/,"With an assist from CNN host Don Lemon, Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell demolished Republican talking points about the US economy.
The duo did so on-air by confronting GOP commentator and former New York State politician Rob Astorino.
Amid serious worry that Donald Trump’s trade war with China and other factors may be setting up a real economic slowdown, White House spokespeople and many other Republicans are insisting that any economic trouble is manufactured by a news media rooting for Trump’s defeat in next year’s elections.

Here is an excerpt from Rampell and Lemon’s discussion:
RAMPELL: “Consumer confidence is not up.”
ASTORINO: “It’s down from what? From really high to a little bit less?”
RAMPELL: “It’s at its lowest level so far this year.”
ASTORINO: “Ask the average person and they think things are going well.”
RAMPELL: “Well The bond market says different.”
ASTORINO: “The bond market? The average consumer who is going out and spending is thinking things are going pretty well. That’s why the Democrats are attacking the economy, because it’s a strength. It’s a smart political move. You always go after your opponent’s strength.”
RAMPELL: “This is such a huge conspiracy! I’m sorry.”
LEMON: “Are you saying, all these people who do the predictions, all the economists, all of them are Democrats?”
ASTORINO: No, definitely not. But they’re all wrong.”

242,Susan Collins’s Seat Downgraded to ‘Toss-up’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/susan-collinss-seat-downgraded-to-toss-up/,"Republican Sen. Susan Collins has long survived in the “purple state” of Maine by exuding a moderate tone.
However, she has become a prime Democratic target since she cast a deciding vote last year to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court following a hearty defense of Kavanaugh after he became the subject of serious charges of sexual misconduct.
And in a fresh sign just how vulnerable Collins may be as she seeks re-election next year, the preeminent nonpartisan Washington political analyst Charlie Cook just changed his rating of the Maine Senate race from “Lean Republican,” to “Toss up.”

“Her poll numbers are TANKING in Maine and her approval rating has dropped to 45%,” Yvette Simpson, CEO of the progressive organization Democracy for America (DFA), wrote in an email to supporters.
DFA is supporting, and fundraising for, Betsy Sweet for the Democratic nomination to take on Collins.
Sweet must face off against Sara Gideon for the Democratic nomination. Gideon is the speaker of the Maine state House of Representatives.
The state primary will be held on Super Tuesday, March 3, 2020.
The winner will run against Collins that fall.
Maine will be certainly be a “must win” state for Democrats next year if they want to take control of the Senate from Republicans.

244,Why I Switched From Bernie to Yang,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/why-i-switched-from-bernie-to-yang/,"This isn’t a switch I made lightly. I’ve been a strong Bernie supporter since 2016 and have been rooting for him until now, in 2019.
I supported Bernie Sanders for a myriad of reasons. The first and foremost being his support of Medicare for All. It is has been my personal belief that everyone deserves access to healthcare no matter what. This is a sort of personal issue for me because I have family members who have put off getting the care they need because they were worried about costs up until the last minute which unfortunately led to their demise.

But I didn’t just support Bernie for his avid support of Medicare for All but also his consistency. It is rare nowadays to see politicians who have remained consistent during their careers. So seeing someone with a consistent message was enlightening.
He was also one of the first people to start turning down PAC money. As someone who one day hopes to run for office, I always worried about where I would get the money to be able to do so. People always say you have to be rich or suck up to the rich. But Bernie came along and showed that you can win without the support of the rich and start empowering people through a grassroots movement.
Yang has always been on my list of the top candidates who I supported to win the nomination, the first of those formerly being Bernie.
Yang also supports a lot of things that Bernie Sanders such as Medicare for All and getting money out of politics. But Yang’s flagship proposal is called the Freedom Dividend. Essentially it’s getting every American over the age of 18 $1,000 a month.
When I look at this I see a lot of problems that this addresses. It gets rid of financial insecurity, allows Americans more economic freedom, and helps address the fact that we’re automating a lot of jobs.

In my opinion, it’s better than Bernie’s or Warren’s plan to just guarantee every American a job.
He’s also a candidate with more than 100 proposals. As someone who has been an advocate for reforming our education system, I took a look at his website and saw that he had a plan for that. A lot of the candidates running just say “forgive all student debt,” and “make college free,” and that’s it. But Yang is not the candidate who just throwing money at the issues without addressing more of the root causes.
He has a comprehensive education plan that will empower more young adults, during their school time, with skills they need so that they can pursue more than just a college degree. As this has been something I have been advocating for, I’m glad someone actually has the plan to bring this into fruition.
Some of the points in his Education proposal were: Promote Vocational Education, Increase Teacher Salaries, Expand Selective Schools, and my favorite: Life-Skills Education in all high schools.
Then he has this policy called “Human-Centered Capitalism.” I’m sure I won’t do it justice by summarizing it here, so I would advise you to check it out here for yourself: https://www.yang2020.com/policies/human-capitalism/
I could go on and on about why I support each and every one of his proposals but then we could be here for a while. When I look at Yang, I see someone who is not only addressing the problem we’re facing today but problems we will be facing in the future.
And there is a sentiment among Yang supporters that I agree with. Bernie was the guy we needed in 2016, but Yang is the guy of the future.

245,Ilhan Omar: The Netanyahu Government Should Stop the Expansion of Settlements if Israel Wants U.S. Aid,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/ilhan-omar-the-netanyahu-government-should-stop-the-expansion-of-settlements-if-israel-wants-u-s-aid/,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government should end the practice of Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories, according to Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), one of the US Democratic congresswomen recently barred entry to Israel.
Omar and fellow first-year progressive Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich) were both recently denied entry to Israel for a planned congressional delegation, on the urging of Donald Trump.

The Israeli government relented on allowing Tlaib, who expressed interest in visiting her aged grandmother, but not for Omar. Tlaib ultimately chose not to make the trip, citing restrictions the Israeli government would have imposed on her freedom of speech.
“My colleague and I are not the only ones who are being denied the right to see for ourselves the reality on the ground on the West Bank,” Omar said. “The Netanyahu government for example is currently trying to deport Omar Shakir, a human rights worker with Human Rights Watch because he has reported on human rights conditions in the West Bank and Gaza. Last year the Netanyahu government refused entry to American citizen Katherine Franke, and my friend Vince Warren who had arrived on a human rights mission. All of these actions have nothing — do nothing to bring us closer to peace. In fact, they do the opposite. They maintain the occupation and prevent a solution to the conflict.
“Fortunately, we in the United States have a constructive role to play. We give Israel more than $3 billion in aid every year. This is predicated on their being an important ally in the region and ‘the only democracy’ in the Middle East. But denying visit to duly elected members of Congress is not consistent with being an ally and denying millions of people freedom of movement or expressions or self-determination is not consistent with being a democracy,” Omar added. “We must be asking as Israel’s ally the Netanyahu government stop the expansion of settlements on Palestinian land and ensure full rights for Palestinians if we are to give them aid. These are not just my views. These are the views held by the range of experts, peace advocates on this issue.”
Calling for an end to the settlements is a long-standing condition for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

246,“No Comment”: Emails Show the VA Took No Action to Spare Veterans From a Harsh Trump Immigration Policy,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/no-comment-emails-show-the-va-took-no-action-to-spare-veterans-from-a-harsh-trump-immigration-policy/,"Originally Published on Propublica
Top officials of the Department of Veterans Affairs declined to step in to try to exempt veterans and their families from a new immigration rule that would make it far easier to deny green cards to low-income immigrants, according to documents obtained by ProPublica under a Freedom of Information Act request.
The Department of Defense, on the other hand, worked throughout 2018 to minimize the new policy’s impact on military families.
As a result, the regulation, which goes into effect in October, applies just as strictly to veterans and their families as it does to the broader public, while active-duty members of the military and reserve forces face a relaxed version of the rule.


Under the so-called public charge regulation, which became final last week, immigrants seeking permanent legal status in the U.S. will be subject to a complex new test to determine if they will rely on public benefits. Among the factors that immigration officers will consider are whether the applicant has frequently used public benefits in the past, their household income, education level and credit scores.
Active-duty military members can accept public benefits without jeopardizing their future immigration status; veterans and their families, however, cannot.
 The rule, which could reshape the face of legal immigration to the U.S., is one of the highest-profile changes to the immigration system undertaken by the administration of President Donald Trump. An initial proposed version of the rule received over 266,000 public comments, the vast majority in opposition. Three lawsuits challenging the policy were quickly filed: one by a coalition of 13 states and filed in Washington state, one by San Francisco and Santa Clara County in California, and one by a coalition of nonprofit groups in California.
Because the new rule creates a complex and subjective test, it’s impossible to predict precisely how many veterans and their families who otherwise qualify for green cards will now be rejected. (The Department of Homeland Security told reporters last Monday that it hasn’t analyzed how many people would most likely be denied green cards under the new rule.)
However, documents tracking the regulation’s development show that the DOD was concerned enough that the rule would harm military families that it worked with DHS to limit the regulation, ultimately securing the benefits exemption for active-duty military members.
The reasons for the VA’s inaction are unclear. The agency referred all questions to the White House, which did not respond to a request for comment. During the six months officials had to weigh in on the new regulation, the VA lacked permanent leaders in several top positions while juggling several major initiatives, which fell behindschedule or failed.
“They should be the foremost government agency that’s fighting for protections for veterans,” said Jeremy Butler, chief executive officer of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. “If they have a ‘No Comment,’ that says to me that it wasn’t given the time and attention and research necessary to understand how it would affect the veteran community.”
Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who sits on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, said in a statement to ProPublica, “It’s despicable that the Trump Administration is punishing veterans who sacrificed for our country simply for using the support services they’ve earned.”
He added, “Instead of tearing down military families, the President should be working to support those who’ve done so much for our country.”
In practice, the exemption the DOD won for active-duty military members is a narrow one. While the frequent use of public benefits is a “heavily weighted negative factor” in determining whether to block an immigrant under the new rule, members of the military and their families are still subject to the other factors weighed by immigration officers when applying for green cards.
But narrow as it is, no such exemption exists for veterans and their families, so using public benefits — as well as other factors like having meager savings — will count against them if they or their families apply for green cards.
“If they care about the active-duty people, I don’t know why they don’t care about military veterans who aren’t doing very well,” said Margaret Stock, an immigration attorney with many military clients. Stock helped create a special program called Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or MAVNI, which created a pathway for military enlistment for refugees, undocumented young people, foreign students and others who lack green cards.


A spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the DHS agency that is implementing the rule, declined to comment, citing pending litigation.
The new policy is a signature effort of the Trump administration and builds on a long-standing law that bars immigration by people deemed to be “public charges.” But the law does not define the term. In 1999, the Clinton administration narrowly defined it to mean someone who “primarily” depends on the government for subsistence, either through cash welfare or long-term care funded by the government.
The new regulation lowers the bar to be considered a “public charge” by redefining it as an immigrant who receives certain types of public benefits for more than 12 months in a three-year period. If an immigrant receives two benefits in a single month, that would count as two months.
The public charge test applies to people entering the country or those trying to become lawful permanent residents, commonly known as green card holders. It does not apply to those who already have green cards and are seeking citizenship.
Noncitizens have long served in the U.S. military, often contributing specific needed skills such as sought-after foreign language fluency. Census data shows that about 100,000 noncitizen veterans live in the U.S., according to a ProPublica analysis of data provided by the University of Minnesota’s IPUMS, which collects and distributes census data. Most of them already have permanent status, Stock said.
It’s not clear exactly how many veterans do not have green cards or have spouses who don’t. Since 2008, about 10,000 people have joined the military through the MAVNI program, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration research group. But the program is currently not accepting applications.
In practice, the public charge rule is more likely to affect veterans’ families — such as spouses who are undocumented or on temporary visas — rather than veterans themselves. Under federal law, undocumented immigrants and temporary visa holders are generally not eligible for public benefits.
“A lot of veterans end up marrying women or men that don’t have green cards; that happens very often,” said Hector Barajas, who leads an advocacy group called Deported Veterans Support House. “There is a population of people that will be affected.”


The White House began seeking agency comments on March 29, 2018. An official at the Office of Management and Budget emailed officials from 19 agencies, including the VA, attaching a draft of the regulation and asking for comments. The email was sent one day after the VA secretary at the time, David Shulkin, was fired by Trump in a tweet. One week after the White House’s email, a VA official in the secretary’s office responded: “VA submits a ‘No Comment’ response.”
The White House again asked for agencies’ comment in July and September 2018, and each time, a VA official sent the same response.
The White House’s Sept. 4, 2018, email stated that the newest draft included “exemptions for service-members.” In an initial proposed version of the regulation released to the public later that month, DHS made clear that it decided on the exemption “following consultation with DOD.”
 The emails obtained by ProPublica do not include military officials’ communications with the White House or DHS. A Pentagon spokeswoman, Jessica Maxwell, said, “DOD was consulted in these conversations,” but she declined to provide further details.
But because the VA declined to provide such “consultation,” an exception for veterans wasn’t considered in the initial proposed regulation in 2018.
Only after members of the public raised the issue during the regulation’s comment period did DHS consider, and ultimately refuse, a veterans’ exemption in the final regulation, which was released last week.
In its justification for the new policy, DHS said veterans aren’t afforded the same exemption as active-duty service members because they have access to special VA benefits, which the new policy doesn’t count against them. Furthermore, the department said, while active-duty service members often need to use benefits to supplement low military salaries, veterans are free to take higher-paying jobs.
But not every veteran receives veterans’ benefits, and the benefits — which include health care for conditions related to military service, education stipends and home-buying assistance — are not a substitute for benefits that make up the broader social safety net like food stamps, Medicaid and housing vouchers. Critics of DHS’ decision say many veteran families occasionally need to use public benefits or fall into poverty.
A VA spokesman declined to say if the agency has any concerns about the new policy’s impact on veterans.
The emails obtained by ProPublica also show that as the White House scrambled to finish the regulation and release it to the public last year, it discouraged federal agencies from arguing against the major thrust of the policy.
“Please do not worry about non-substantive line edits,” a White House official, whose name is redacted, wrote in bolded type. “Please recognize, also, that the decision of whether to propose expanding the definition of public charge, broadly, has been made at a very high level and will not be changing.”

247,"WaPo’s Rucker: ‘Privately,’ Trump Is Quite ‘Alarmed and Rattled’ with the Economy",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/wapos-rucker-privately-trump-is-quite-alarmed-and-rattled-with-the-economy/,"Although publicly, Donald Trump and his advisers wave off any suggestion of a recession for the US economy the reality is quite different in private, according to a prominent Washington Post reporter.
As recently as last week at a rally in New Hampshire, Trump was boasting that even Americans who don’t like him would “have to” vote for him to keep the economy strong.

Likewise, such Trump economic advisers as Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro have been making the rounds of TV interviews to proclaim a solid US economy and strong markets into 2020 and beyond.
“Privately our reporting has been he’s quite alarmed and rattled about some of these negative indicators that we’ve seen this week and over the past couple of weeks as well as what’s happening abroad with some of these foreign countries, foreign economies,” Post reporter Phil Rucker said of Trump. “And Trump is calling out to CEOs, to friends, to some of his real estate buddies trying to take their temperature and also voicing skepticism about some of the data that he’s seeing, saying some of these statistics are not to be believed because they’re cooked up by economists who have an anti-Trump bias. We will see how this plays out but it’s not a particularly good sign from some of his advisers.”
An economic downturn could seriously jeopardize Trump’s chances for a second term as president.
“We know the president’s advisors think that his reelection hinges on how the economy is performing and it needs to be a strong economy for him to win reelection,” NBC reporter Carol Lee said in a separate appearance. “His polls consistently show that his handling of the economy is approved of far more than whether his general approval or on any other issue.
“And you’ve also seen, whether it’s Republicans or people who sort of the hold-your-nose-and-vote-for-Trump crowd, they’ve stuck with him through some of the rhetoric, some of the things he’s done that they don’t like because they say, ‘Oh, you know, he does that, but look at the economy,'” she added. “And what happens to those folks? You know, do they stick with him? Do they turn on him? And it’s real risky for him.”

248,"“Dirtbag,” “Savages,” “Subhuman”: A Border Agent’s Hateful Career and the Crime That Finally Ended It",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/dirtbag-savages-subhuman-a-border-agents-hateful-career-and-the-crime-that-finally-ended-it/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
It was late November 2017, and Matthew Bowen, a veteran Border Patrol agent, was seething. A fellow Border Patrol agent in Texas had just been found dead in the field, and Bowen was certain someone who’d been crossing the border illegally was responsible for murdering him.
“Snuffed out by some dirtbag,” Bowen, stationed in Nogales, Arizona, said in a text later obtained by federal authorities.
Bowen, if lacking in evidence, wasn’t alone in his anger and suspicion. President Donald Trump, nearing the end of his first year in office and already frustrated in his bid to construct a wall on the southern border, had promised to “seek out and bring to justice those responsible” for the Texas agent’s death. Brandon Judd, the head of the union that represents Border Patrol agents, declared to Fox News and other media outlets that the Texas agent had been “ambushed.”


Bowen’s work record suggested his distaste for the mix of migrants and drug traffickers crossing the border illegally could be dangerous. He’d been the subject of multiple internal investigations over excessive force during his 10-year career, court records show. In one, he’d been accused of giving a handcuffed suspect what agents called a “rough ride,” slamming the brakes on his all-terrain vehicle in a way that flung the suspect into the ground.
Bowen, though, had stayed on the job. And with the news of the Texas agent’s death, his disgust for illegal border-crossers seemed only to have deepened.
“Mindless murdering savages,” he texted to another agent that November.
Two weeks later, Bowen climbed behind the wheel of a Border Patrol pickup truck and used it to strike a Guatemalan migrant in a dusty parking lot in southern Arizona. Bowen eventually was arrested by federal authorities in May 2018 and charged with using his Ford F-150 pickup, a 4,000-pound vehicle, to menace the man as he tried to flee Bowen and other agents on foot. The truck, according to an affidavit filed by prosecutors in court, hit the man twice and came within inches of running him over. Prosecutors accused Bowen of using “deadly force against a person who was running away from him and posed no threat.”
On Monday, after months of legal wrangling and on the eve of trial, Bowen pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor civil rights charge, an offense that carries a potential term of up to a year in jail. In his plea deal, Bowen admitted to hitting the man with his truck and promised to resign from the Border Patrol. Sentencing has been set for October.
Bowen’s arrest and a variety of his ugly texts concerning migrants and others crossing the border illegally have been widely reported in recent months. But court documents and interviews suggest that his checkered career speaks to a much broader problem in the Border Patrol: its inability or unwillingness to identify and discipline problem agents.
The case against Bowen comes amid increasing scrutiny of an agency that critics and insiders say is permeated by a culture of contempt for migrants. This year, ProPublica exposed the existence of a secret Facebook group in which agents engaged in cruel and dehumanizing discussions about people coming into the U.S. unlawfully. ProPublica has also detailed the failures by the agency to fully reform what critics inside and outside the Border Patrol have deemed a failed system of discipline for troubled agents.


Bowen’s attack on the Guatemalan migrant was at least the sixth time he had been accused of using excessive force during his decade with the agency.
None of the previous episodes resulted in any discipline beyond an “oral admonishment.” Unlike many police departments, the Border Patrol has no early intervention program for troubled agents, measures that would have triggered additional training or a deeper inquiry into Bowen’s behavior and mindset even if his conduct did not warrant formal discipline. At least two supervisors with direct knowledge of Bowen’s work history said they regarded him as a danger but were resigned to the fact that the agency was unlikely to ever punish or even fire him.
“Other law enforcement agencies would’ve weeded him out,” said one of those who supervised Bowen. “Other law enforcement agencies have much higher standards than we do.”
Bowen’s attorney, Sean Chapman, had sought to keep his record of complaints from being introduced at trial. The lawyer had also asked a judge to bar all or most of his text messages from being made known to any eventual jury. Faced with having to explain the texts, Chapman had said in court filings that the conversations were not unusual, but instead “commonplace” in the part of Arizona where Bowen worked. The texts, the lawyer argued in one filing last spring, are “part of the agency’s culture.”
If true, it’s a remarkable claim, for the messages Bowen traded over the years with colleagues are openly hateful. In one, he said the men, women and children attempting to cross into the U.S. were “disgusting subhuman shit unworthy of being kindling in a fire.” In another, he joked about how tasty Guatemalan migrants can be if they are properly “fried” through the use of Tasers. In yet another, Bowen trained his anger on his own agency, calling it a “fucking failed agency” where he and other agents “are treated like shit, prosecuted for doing what it takes to arrest these savages, and not given appropriate resources to fully do our job.”
In texts Bowen sent after he assaulted the migrant, he referred to the victim as a “guat” and dismissed the incident as all but a nonevent, suggesting the only reason it had resulted in any action was because it was caught on a camera belonging to the patrol’s parent organization, Customs and Border Protection.


With Bowen still awaiting sentencing, Chapman declined to speak in detail about the case or his client. However, the attorney insisted that the offensive messages “were in reference to specific events where Border Patrol agents were assaulted or killed. The texts therefore were not intended to be a general comment about illegal immigrants — only about individuals that attacked or injured agents.”
Officials with the Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection would not respond to questions about Bowen’s case and what it might say about wider problems with the patrol.
In November 2017, enraged about the death of the agent in Texas, Bowen lamented that the border-crossers he suspected of killing the agent might spend years eluding the authorities.
“It will probably take them eight years to find the fucking beaners responsible,” he wrote in a text.
Months later, the FBI completed an exhaustive investigation into the Texas agent’s death. There was no evidence he’d been murdered. The local Texas sheriff said it appeared the agent, 36-year-old Rogelio Martinez, had fallen into a deep concrete culvert and suffered fatal head trauma.
“To date none of the more than 650 interviews completed, locations searched, or evidence collected and analyzed have produced evidence that would support the existence of a scuffle, altercation, or attack,” the bureau’s El Paso office said in a statement.
By then, Bowen had already committed the crime for which he’d pay with his career.
“I’ve Seen Egregious Incidents Get Swept Under the Rug”
Bowen — 6-foot-2, 185 pounds — joined the Border Patrol in 2008 just as it was undergoing the most substantial transformation in its history. With Congress boosting the Border Patrol’s funding, the agency underwent a massive hiring push, a surge that roughly doubled the number of agents in the span of just six years. Former officials now say the speed of the Border Patrol’s expansion made it likely there would be bad hires, perhaps a significant number of them.
Bowen, who had lived in South Carolina before joining the agency, was assigned to the Border Patrol station in Nogales, an outpost in the hill country of southern Arizona, where scrubby mesquite and paloverde trees stud the rugged landscape. The station, a fortresslike compound, stands about 2 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, which is marked here by a rusty, 20-foot-tall steel fence encrusted with coils of razor wire. On one side of the barrier is the small town of Nogales, Arizona. On the other is the larger city of Nogales, in the state of Sonora, a major Mexican manufacturing hub that is home to more than 200,000 people.


The world of the Border Patrol is broken up into 20 geographic regions called sectors. The Nogales station is located in the Tucson sector, which covers about two-thirds of Arizona. While migration patterns and contraband routes are always evolving, the Tucson sector tends to be one of the busiest areas for Border Patrol agents. Agents in the sector made more than 52,000 arrests during the last fiscal year. Only the Rio Grande Valley sector in Texas had more apprehensions.
Over the years, the Tucson sector has also been known as a trouble spot within the patrol. In 2017, there were 701 disciplinary cases involving sector agents, more than anywhere else in the country.
In interviews, several people who worked with or supervised Bowen said he grew to have a reputation as a bully, a man with a bilious disdain for those seeking asylum or illegal entry into the U.S. In texts, Bowen referred to migrants and other border-crossers as “beaners” or “tonks,” a pejorative term referring to the sound made when agents banged their flashlights on the heads of those being taken into custody.
In later texts, he discussed his frustrations with the job and pondered quitting the patrol. A co-worker sent back a message reminding Bowen of the fun aspects of the job, like “running down shitbags who thought they had you fooled.”
From 2012 to 2015, five different people detained by Bowen accused him of needless violence, according to court records.
In January 2012, according to prosecutors, Bowen searched a young man’s car at a security checkpoint without probable cause. Bowen pulled the man from the car, threw him to the ground and handcuffed him. In March 2015, a fellow agent expressed concern after Bowen tackled a migrant and busted the man’s lip. A month later, an undocumented man said that Bowen had dragged him around by his handcuffs, causing painful abrasions to his wrists. In September 2015, Bowen was again reported by a colleague, this time for taking down a juvenile in a particularly violent fashion.


Later that fall, Bowen was accused of the “rough ride” incident. After apprehending an undocumented migrant in the desert, Bowen handcuffed him and threw him on the front of his ATV, according to court records and interviews. Then Bowen made the ride as unpleasant as possible, said a Border Patrol employee with direct knowledge of the incident. At one point, the employee said, Bowen purposely stomped on the brakes, causing the man, still handcuffed, to fly off the vehicle and slam into the dirt.
In these cases, Bowen was investigated by either Customs and Border Protection’s internal affairs bureau or by the Office of Inspector General with the Department of Homeland Security. Neither the internal affairs unit nor the Inspector General’s office responded to requests for comment.
Prosecutors sought permission to bring evidence of Bowen’s allegedly abusive behavior into the expected trial, arguing that the complaints helped to provide broader context for the truck attack. The defense attorney, Chapman, countered, saying in court briefs that the only relevant incident was the ATV episode, since it involved the use of a vehicle as a weapon.
Chapman, in court papers, maintained that Bowen had only been censured for two of the incidents, saying he’d received an “oral admonishment” after the episodes in March and April 2015. According to the attorney, Bowen was cleared of misconduct in the other three cases.
A current Border Patrol manager who worked with Bowen for many years said “oral admonishments are a joke” that do little to deter bad behavior.
The Border Patrol’s system for investigating and disciplining its agents has long been suspect, and in 2016, a blue-ribbon panel of experts named by then-President Barack Obama declared it nothing short of “broken.” Investigations dragged on for years, in part because there were too few investigators. Victims who accused agents of misconduct were largely kept in the dark, barred from knowing whether the accused agents had been found culpable and disciplined in any way. Scores of agents were arrested every year and charged with a wide variety of crimes, but many managed to hang onto their jobs.


One former Customs and Border Protection manager with extensive knowledge of the Border Patrol’s disciplinary process said the quality of casework was lacking and the end results of investigations inconsistent. The former official said the authority to discipline agents for on-the-job misconduct and policy violations generally rests with commanders in each of the agency’s 20 geographic sectors. Of the more than 700 discipline cases in the Tucson sector in 2017, more than 500 led to “informal discipline” or no punishment at all.
“I’ve seen egregious incidents get swept under the rug,” said the former Customs and Border Protection official, citing cases involving domestic violence and assault, embezzlement and lying to superiors.
Bowen’s lack of regard for any oversight at the agency comes through in the texts obtained by prosecutors. The discipline process, he suggested, is little more than a system for supervising officials to cover their rear ends. Customs and Border Protection employees who reported their co-workers for excessive force or other wrongs were “fags.”
“BP is just meant to destroy guys that want to catch people,” Bowen wrote in one text about his frustration with the agency.
One of the supervisors who managed Bowen said the Border Patrol’s disciplinary system is largely punitive and only responds, when it does at all, to one incident at a time. Many big city police departments, noted the supervisor, have created early intervention systems, which can track everything from uses of force to tardiness to public complaints in order to identify troubled officers and help them change course before something tragic occurs. Under such a system, the supervisor said, the pattern of complaints against Bowen could have prompted mandatory retraining or some kind of counseling. Either he would have improved or been squarely on the agency’s radar as a potential menace.
“It absolutely works,” the supervisor said of such early intervention systems.
“He Did Not Deserve to Be Executed”
At some point, records and interviews show, Bowen found another agent in Nogales with whom he felt a sense of kinship, Lonnie Swartz. They would come in the years ahead to share their perspectives on migrants and their dim view of their agency’s stomach for the hard work of ending illegal immigration. While joking darkly about their jobs, the two, records show, once had shared a three-minute video of a Border Patrol agent pummeling an undocumented man, repeatedly smashing his skull against the steel beams of a border fence.
“Please let us take the gloves off trump,” Bowen once wrote to Swartz in a text.


Bowen’s Border Patrol buddy, it turns out, probably never should have been hired. In 1995, he had enlisted in the U.S. Army and was stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky. But, within weeks, he had gone AWOL and fled the base. Facing criminal charges under military law, Swartz lived on the lam for nearly two years before he was captured in Las Vegas by a joint task force of local police officers and FBI agents, federal court records indicate. He was eventually ousted from the Army with an “other than honorable” discharge.
Somehow, however, he made it through the agency’s background check process and was hired by the Border Patrol in 2009, a year after Bowen. Court records indicate that Swartz misled the background investigators about his violations of military law during the hiring process in 2009 and again during a second background check in 2014. The former Customs and Border Protection official said that the Army discharge issue should have kept Swartz out of the patrol.
“That’s just shoddy,” the person said. “That should be an automatic disqualification. Whoever did the background investigation didn’t do their job properly.”
Chapman, who specializes in cases involving Border Patrol agents, represented Swartz during his trials. In an email, the attorney said Swartz “didn’t attempt to mislead anyone” about his history with the Army.
A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection would not comment on the circumstances surrounding Swartz’s hiring.
In 2012, about two years after graduating from the Border Patrol academy, Swartz was the one facing federal criminal charges. Swartz had shot and killed a 16-year-old boy, José Antonio Elena Rodríguez, during what he and other agents said was a dangerous encounter with rock-throwing Mexican nationals along the border fence. Charging Swartz with murder, federal prosecutors told a very different story. They said that in reality Swartz was in no danger of being struck by a stone when he opened fire and shot the teen 10 times — two bullets hit the youth in the head, the others in the back. Rather, the prosecutors argued, Swartz killed the boy because he was “fed up” after a series of clashes with migrants and other border-crossers.


Whether or not the boy was throwing rocks that night, prosecutors said, “it wasn’t a capital offense. He did not deserve to be executed.”
The shooting prompted a long and unusual series of events. For three years, the Border Patrol would not make public the name of the agent who had shot the boy, including to the boy’s family. It was only after the family filed suit against the agency that the federal authorities brought criminal charges against Swartz. His first trial ended with a jury acquitting him of murder charges but deadlocking on the lesser offense of manslaughter. The second, coming near the end of 2018, resulted in Swartz’s acquittal on all charges. The second jury had repeatedly told the judge it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, and it only wound up acquitting when the judge ordered the jurors to keep trying.
Swartz’s lawyer argued at the trials that Swartz had followed proper procedure in firing his weapon.
“You can employ deadly force against a rock thrower if he poses a risk of serious bodily harm. That’s the law,” said Chapman during the second trial. “And that’s what he did. He followed his training and he followed the law.”
But a high-ranking Border Patrol agent who served in Nogales said that Swartz was a management challenge from the start of his tenure with the patrol. “He was too aggressive” and was constantly looking to escalate encounters with smugglers or migrants at the border fence, the agent said. Supervisors, said the agent, tried unsuccessfully “to reel him in.”
Disturbed by the teen’s killing — and a raft of other cross-border shootings — Customs and Border Protection leaders in 2013 brought in a team of outside law enforcement experts to examine the Border Patrol’s guidelines regarding the use of firearms. “Frustration is a factor motivating agents to shoot at rock throwers,” found the analysts, who studied 67 shooting incidents and 10 key policy directives. “While rock throwing can result in injuries or death, there must be clear justification to warrant the use of deadly force.”


The report, produced by the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington, D.C.-based consultancy, was followed by a four-page update to the use-of-force policies. Under the new rules, agents who were attacked with rocks or other projectiles were supposed to seek cover and “distance themselves from the immediate area of danger.”
The change left many agents grumbling that the Border Patrol had gone soft.
The Border Patrol would not say if Swartz still works for the agency in any capacity.
“It Just Seems to Keep Getting Worse”
Around 7:30 one morning in December 2017, a 23-year-old Guatemalan national named Antolín López-Aguilar slipped over the border fence in Nogales and tried to hide underneath a parked semi-trailer.
Bowen, who was driving a green-and-white patrol-issued truck, was sent to apprehend the migrant. He was accompanied by two other agents who had been dispatched in separate vehicles.
When López-Aguilar tried to run, Bowen, still in his truck, gave chase. According to prosecutors, Bowen then made the conscious decision to drive his F-150 pickup into the migrant, striking the man twice from behind and pushing him to the ground. The attack, which prosecutors said left López-Aguilar mildly injured and traumatized, was captured by video cameras at a nearby port of entry.
In the days and weeks after the assault, texts obtained by the government show, Bowen appeared both proud of his conduct and confident that little would come of it. In a text to Swartz, Bowen boasted of having performed what he called “a human pit maneuver.” PIT stands for pursuit intervention tactic. In simple terms it involves a police officer or law enforcement agent driving his or her car into the rear of a fleeing vehicle. There is no such thing in American policing as a “human pit maneuver.”
“The tonk was totally fine,” Bowen wrote, using the crude term again. “Just a little bump with a ford bumper.”
“If I had to tackle the tonk,” he said in another message, “I would still be doing memos and shit.”
In his text conversations, Bowen complained that he was only being investigated because the incident had been captured by the video cameras. He acknowledged that he’s been on the “radar” of the internal affairs bureau and seemed to have wearied of the agency’s efforts, however modest, to police its own.
“I’ve decided after this is cleared up, I’m resigning,” he wrote.
It did not get cleared up, and Bowen’s texts reveal his growing anxiety. He noted that he could be charged with assault with a deadly weapon. He feared being sent away from his family. For comfort, he reached out to Swartz, who at the time was still in the midst of his prosecution for the boy’s shooting.


“Guys are being made to think any use of force results in you being investigated,” Bowen wrote to Swartz. “And so they are letting tonks get away with way too much.”
The array of texts obtained by the government, whatever significance they have for Bowen’s crime or the Border Patrol’s oversight of him, do offer a very personal and specific window into the mindset and apparent morale problems that current and former agents say plague the agency.
Bowen derided the “liberal” media and Obama appointees, and he thought in the current political environment, prosecutors were determined to make criminal prosecutions out of virtually any use-of-force case that gets referred to them. He was bitter, he said, about how the system was “rigged” just as Trump claimed, although it’s unclear what system he was talking about. Swartz seemed sympathetic. In one text to Bowen, he complained about how the agency was under-funded, and its equipment was unreliable, even its weapons.
Bowen made clear in his texts that he no longer believed in his own agency, and that he had been contemplating bailing from the Border Patrol for a long time. He’d explored taking classes that might help him get into the real estate business — his wife was a real estate agent — or starting a trucking company. He’s done with his “mindless” job.
“I just have to transition away from BP,” wrote Bowen. “I think it will be like coming out of a 10-year depression.”
He continued, “There were lots of good days. But the past few years the bad has far outweighed the good and it just seems to keep getting worse.”
In a text from Dec. 8, 2017, just days after the incident with the truck, Bowen wrote without irony: “This shit is the kicker I needed to make the decision,” he said of resigning. “I feel like one day I would have to make a decision that would cost me my life or my freedom.”

249,Omar and Tlaib: ‘Neither Has Said They Hate Israel or the Israeli People’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/omar-and-tlaib-neither-has-said-they-hate-israel-or-the-israeli-people/,"Donald Trump’s vehement assertions that Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan have voiced hate for Israel is simply untrue, according to a well-known White House reporter.
And the politics of the outspoken House freshmen fit right in within the best of the history of the upper Midwest, a best-selling filmmaker said, separately.
Trump raised the stakes in his feud with Omar and Tlaib late last week by pressuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bar the congresswomen from entry to Israel for a planned official congressional delegation.

“Now, first a little bit of a fact-check. Neither has ever said that they hate Israel or the Israeli people,” Welker said in an on-air report with MSNBC host Craig Melvin. “They have been critical of the Israeli government. They recently voted, in essence, in favor of a boycott of the Israeli state over its treatment of Palestinians and they have made some controversial comments about Israeli’s. Omar having to walk back some of those comments.
“But, Craig, look, this comes against a broader backdrop here. The fact that you have President Trump who has attacked them along with two other freshman congresswomen on Twitter essentially calling them socialists, calling for them to go back to their countries — you’ll remember that,” Welker added. “That of course sparks that chant during one of his rallies, send her back, which prompted furry and outrage from members of his own party, quite frankly, as well as Democrats. So this is one more escalation in that ongoing very bitter back and forth between the president and these congresswomen.”
However, the congresswomen’s politics fall well within the traditions of the region they represent, according to progressive filmmaker Michael Moore, himself a native of Flint, Mich.
“Well, first of all, Michigan has a long history, as does Wisconsin and Minnesota, the upper midwest, of what you would call socialism or democratic socialism or farm labor Democratic Party. We’ve never trusted the banks or the large corporations,” Moore said. “General Motors was founded in Flint, Mich., in 1908. A year of General Motors trying to turn this into a company town, people about so upset at it, in the next election, Flint elected a socialist mayor to remove the pro-GM mayor when the corporation first began. So that’s who we are. And the 13th district that Rashida Tlaib represents also has a strong history of — sadly right now it’s the third poorest congressional district in the country.

“But it also has another history. The congressman back in 1972 — I remember this. I was a senior in high school. Charles Diggs was his name. He’s one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. He represented Tlaib’s district in the ‘70s,” Moore added. “He wanted to go and see the situation in South Africa. And the South African government would not give him a visa and they banned him from visiting the country.
“So all these years later to have our congresswoman from the 13th district in Detroit facing a similar thing, what is it that they’re afraid that they’re going to see? What is it that — what doesn’t the Israeli government — I mean I watched earlier [MSNBC host] Ali Velshi had on one of the Israeli army veterans. He said, ‘I was going to be her guide through Hebron, and I was going to take her down the main street of Hebron, where it’s now vacant. All the shops are gone. The Israeli army calls it a sterile street.’ That’s what he said right on this network, a sterile street because there are no Arabs around. Our members of Congress need to see that, and that’s what unfortunately they’re not going to be able to.”

250,"Welcome to the Greenbrier, the Governor-Owned Luxury Resort Filled With Conflicts of Interest",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/welcome-to-the-greenbrier-the-governor-owned-luxury-resort-filled-with-conflicts-of-interest/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
On a sunny Monday afternoon two and a half years ago, Jim Justice, the wealthiest man in West Virginia, took the oath of office as the state’s 36th governor.
Standing at the base of the Capitol steps in Charleston, he assured his fellow West Virginians that his vast business empire of coal mines, vacation resorts and agricultural companies — many of them regulated by the state agencies he would soon control — posed no conflicts with his new job.
“I want absolutely nothing. Nothing,” Justice said. “I don’t want a thing for me or my family in any way. All I want is goodness for this incredible state and its incredible people.”


Hours later, the new governor held his inaugural ball, not at a Charleston hotel or the local civic center, as his predecessors long had, but at The Greenbrier, a palatial resort 120 miles from the Capitol.
The hotel’s owner: Jim Justice.
Thousands of guests mingled across The Greenbrier’s multiple ballrooms and ornate lobbies, feasting on a local-inspired menu that included fried chicken and ham biscuits. Some tried their luck at the resort’s casino.
In the 12,000-square-foot Colonial Hall, Lionel Richie serenaded the first couple with his 1977 Commodores’ hit “Easy.” “Do it, Jim! Do it, Jim!” the singer coaxed, as Justice and his wife, Cathy, slow-danced on the stage.
Partygoers paid $75 each for tickets. But the tab was largely picked up by industry leaders, statehouse lobbyists and a variety of special interest groups, each contributing thousands of dollars to the governor’s inaugural committee to fund the lavish festivities.
All told, more than $1 million — half of the inaugural fund — went to Justice’s Greenbrier Hotel Corp., according to financial reports filed with the secretary of state’s office.
State ethics officials have described the arrangement as perfectly legal. Private dollars funded the event, and no public money flowed to the inaugural committee. But they also say West Virginia laws never contemplated someone like Jim Justice.


With his decision to hold the ball at The Greenbrier, Justice ushered in a new era of politics in West Virginia, one in which it’s hard to tell where the governor’s business interests end and state government begins.
The billionaire now faces a complicated ethical landscape with striking similarities to the entanglements surrounding his Republican political ally, President Donald Trump. A corporate executive whose most recent financial disclosure listed 130 separate business entities, Justice early in his term said he had turned over day-to-day control of his businesses to his adult children. But, like Trump, he stopped short of placing most of his assets in a blind trust that would have shielded him from at least the appearance of conflicts.
Today, Justice’s coal mines are inspected by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and the Office of Miners’ Health, Safety and Training, agencies whose top employees the governor appoints. And his casino is regulated by West Virginia’s Lottery Commission, another agency under the chief executive’s control.
The Greenbrier represents only a slice of Justice’s holdings, estimated by Forbes to be worth as much as $1.5 billion. But the iconic resort’s outsized role in West Virginia politics has made it an unparalleled ethical thicket for the governor.
Before taking office, Justice benefited from a number of state agencies, as well as special interest groups, using his resort to host marquee meetings, retreats and conferences. In 2015, the state spent more than $260,000 there. So, to avoid conflicts of interest as governor, his administration says it imposed a “moratorium” on state spending at The Greenbrier.


But a Charleston Gazette-Mail and ProPublica investigation has found that Justice continues to profit from state business, with agencies spending more than $106,000 at his resort since he took office. The Tourism Office features The Greenbrier in a state advertising campaign that launched last year.
Meanwhile, some of West Virginia’s most powerful trade groups are increasingly picking up the food and lodging tabs for lawmakers, as well as top state agency officials subject to the administration’s spending ban, according to a review of lobbyist disclosure reports filed with the state Ethics Commission. Outlays from the state Chamber of Commerce, for instance, more than tripled during Justice’s first year in office.
And as The Greenbrier has faced serious financial pressures, from a major flood and a legal battle with insurers, Justice has used the power of his office to help ensure its survival.
Last year, as the state’s chief executive, he decided to include The Greenbrier in a federal “opportunity zone.” Intended to help underdeveloped communities, the designation makes new investments in the targeted area eligible for lucrative tax breaks.
At the same time, Justice and Greenbrier officials sought additional assistance from Greenbrier County, where the resort has long been the largest employer. Working together, they pressed county commissioners to set aside more than $10 million in taxpayer funds to finance or jump-start projects related to The Greenbrier. The proposed upgrades range from a new laundry to a long-planned ski area.
The governor’s office did not respond to multiple requests for an interview with Justice, but queries were referred to a spokesman for Justice’s companies.
In a prepared response to written questions from the Gazette-Mail and ProPublica, spokesman Richard Cullen Jr. said, “Mr. Justice has every right to have business interests as governor and he will continue to demonstrate great sensitivity to ethical considerations.”
For much of the past two and a half years, the governor has weathered public scrutiny as his businesses wrestled with state and federal regulators over fines and penalties, with vendors over missed payments and with tax officials in West Virginia and other states over delinquent corporate taxes. But as Justice prepares to face voters again next year, the intermingling of The Greenbrier with West Virginia government is causing growing legal and political headaches.


“It’s wrong,” said U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who supported Justice in 2016 but split with him when the governor switched to the GOP less than a year after taking office. Manchin attended the inaugural ball and his political committee donated $2,500 to the event, although he now condemns Justice’s decision to use his own resort.
“It’s called public service, not self-service,” Manchin said. “This sort of stuff is not who we are.”
Complicating matters, in March, prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Public Integrity Section issued a subpoena for state Commerce Department records concerning the administration’s dealings with The Greenbrier. Weeks later, investigators subpoenaed more records, this time from the state Department of Revenue and its Tax Division, about the resolution of a multimillion-dollar tax debt related to the governor’s businesses.
Justice has denied any wrongdoing.
“In an organization as big as our organization, you’re surely going to be able to find something that doesn’t look right or whatever,” the governor said during an April news conference. “But I promise you to God above … you’re never going to find anything that Jim Justice has purposely done to benefit Jim Justice.”
“The Emerald City”
James C. Justice II grew up in Raleigh County, not far from The Greenbrier, and still lives in nearby Lewisburg, just a 15-minute drive from the resort. Born in 1951, he came of age during the height of the Cold War, a time when the federal government was secretly building a bunker beneath The Greenbrier, where the nation’s leaders would shelter in the event of a nuclear attack.
Justice’s father was a coal operator and, as a teenager, Justice played golf at the resort. He told his friends it was like Oz, the Emerald City, according to a 2011 interview with The Washington Post.
Justice joined his father’s business in 1976, when he was 25, and expanded into farming corn, wheat and soybeans. When James Sr. died in 1993, his son took charge.


“Over the next 15 years, Jim launched a massive expansion of multiple businesses which included significant coal reserve expansion, Christmas tree farms, cotton gins, turfgrass operations, golf courses, timber enhancement and land projects just to mention a few,” his official biography says. According to the governor’s office, Justice is now the largest farmer east of the Mississippi, with holdings in West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
The most visible expansion of Justice’s empire, however, came in 2009, when he purchased The Greenbrier, one of the nation’s top luxury hotels. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the 700-room resort has hosted 27 presidents.
Hit by a global recession after several years of expensive renovations, the resort was in financial peril. Its longtime owner, railroad company CSX Corp., laid off half the staff and filed for bankruptcy, disclosing in its court filing that the property had lost $90 million over the previous five years.
Marriott International had agreed to step in, but Justice also saw an opportunity.


He had recently sold much of his family’s coal holdings to the Russian firm Mechel in a transaction valued at more than $568 million. The billionaire quickly cut a deal to pay CSX $20 million for The Greenbrier and give Marriott a $7.5 million “breakup fee.”
The move instantly raised Justice’s profile, turning the president of a privately held family coal operation into a bit of a celebrity. The Gazette-Mail named him “West Virginian of the Year,” largely because it credited him with saving The Greenbrier.
Within months of his purchase, though, Justice turned to the state for help. Specifically, he wanted $8 million to lure the PGA Tour to his resort for a new professional golf tournament. He argued that such an event would draw thousands of visitors and a giant television audience. Keith Burdette, a former state senator who was then serving as state commerce secretary, balked at the amount Justice was seeking. “I just said, ‘No, we can’t do that,’” he recalled in an interview.
Still, in 2010, the state ultimately kicked in $1 million and, the next year, it began a lucrative sponsorship that gave state officials access to blocks of rooms and seats on the 18th green, perks that could be used to help woo potential new businesses to West Virginia. Over the next five years, West Virginia contributed an additional $9.3 million to sponsor the popular tournament, according to a review of state spending records and documents that were turned over to a federal grand jury.
Later, Justice’s company successfully lobbied for additional assistance, supporting new state tourism programs that qualified The Greenbrier for up to $15 million in tax breaks. The money served to offset the cost of resort improvements, including an NFL training camp facility and a championship tennis stadium, but the exact amount it received won’t be known until December, when a new disclosure law takes effect.
“America’s Resort,” a Political Liability
Tucked into a valley where the rolling foothills and farmlands of Virginia meet the mountains of West Virginia, The Greenbrier resort has been a central character in the region’s economic and political story for nearly two centuries.
The first large hotel was constructed in the 1850s, becoming a popular playground for, as the late U.S. Sen. Robert C. Byrd once put it, “the great and the near-great.” The Rev. Billy Graham, Bing Crosby and Babe Ruth were guests. Among the regulars were prominent politicians, judges, diplomats and socialites.


Today, The Greenbrier calls itself “America’s Resort.” Over the years, the sprawling property was redesigned to evoke Mount Vernon, George Washington’s historic home. A standard room costs $300 a night.
Guests can bowl or play croquet, fish or go skeet shooting, ride horses or learn falconry. For decades, two of the state’s most powerful interest groups, the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce and the West Virginia Coal Association, have used the hotel to host their annual meetings.
“The Greenbrier is great, and it’s one of those places that our people just look forward to going every year,” said Bill Raney, the coal association’s president. “It’s got a long, long history with this industry.”
Justice deepened the resort’s role in West Virginia power circles with the PGA Tour event, which became a key part of the state’s efforts to lure new businesses and jobs.
“There was virtually no recruiting effort that took place during those years when the company we were recruiting didn’t come through the door because of The Greenbrier Classic,” Burdette said.
But not everyone saw the merits of more than $10 million in taxpayer money going to a golf tournament. Early on, some Republican leaders tried to block state funding, arguing that it would be better spent on public infrastructure.
And the further Justice stepped into politics, the bigger a liability the golf sponsorship became.
In early 2015, Justice — a Republican for much of his life — changed his party affiliation to Democrat and promptly declared his bid for governor. He touted The Greenbrier as proof of his business savvy, but his primary opponents picked at the golf tournament, objecting to the state’s financial contributions.
Justice won the Democratic nomination anyway, and as he entered the 2016 general election, he rejected the public funding. “I refuse to listen to the Republican leaders beat up on me,” he said in a campaign statement.
But that didn’t stop GOP nominee Bill Cole. The Republican continued to pound away, saying the golf tournament was just scratching the surface of Justice’s conflicts.


“I think his interactions with state government are huge,” Cole told West Virginia MetroNews at the time. “I see in every aspect of his business, there’s troubling connections.”
Even as his candidate financial disclosure form listed a dozen agencies doing business with The Greenbrier, Justice dismissed the criticism.
Throughout the race, he seemed to double-down on his resort ownership. One campaign ad, featuring Greenbrier employees, touted his success turning the resort around. “He’s done so much for The Greenbrier,” a voiceover said. “Imagine what he could do for the state.”
Justice used the resort for two major fundraisers that earned nearly $270,000 for his campaign. Separately, he donated $223,000 from the resort to the gubernatorial bid, in the form of rooms, catering and entertainment.
That November, Justice won the election. The Greenbrier, however, was in trouble.
A series of strong thunderstorms had brought a major flood across the Greenbrier River Valley. Nearly two-dozen West Virginians died. Hundreds lost their homes and businesses.


The summer storms severely damaged the resort’s golf courses, the hotel and surrounding buildings. The casino was flooded. Work to sell more luxury homes in the nearby Greenbrier Sporting Club ceased, as did plans to construct a ski area for resort guests, hotel lawyers later said in court documents.
But Justice called on tourists to return. “We will not go quietly into the darkness,” Justice said when the resort reopened in July.
“The Biggest House in the State”
Five months later, as Justice transitioned to the governor’s office, he chose his resort as the site of his inaugural ball. He appointed his wife, Cathy, and his daughter, Jill, both of whom held positions with The Greenbrier, as co-chairs of the inaugural committee.
Nick Casey, a longtime Democratic Party leader and treasurer of the committee, said he briefly raised the issue of a potential conflict of interest with Justice and his family.
“I said, ‘Can we spend this money on somewhere the guy owns?’” Casey recalled in a recent interview. “But there weren’t any detailed discussions. He said, ‘No, we’ll do it at The Greenbrier.’”
Cullen, the Justice companies spokesman, noted that The Greenbrier is a “premier destination, not just in West Virginia, but the entire country,” and is “a big part of the state’s history and employs thousands of people.”
“Governor Justice is proud of that history and his family’s role in it,” Cullen said. “There was never a discussion about having the [inaugural ball] anywhere else.”


If anyone was troubled by the decision, few said so publicly at the time. Donations poured in to the committee, with Justice easily raising more than twice the amount his immediate predecessors had.
But privately, some prominent powerbrokers wondered about a potential conflict.
“I was like: ‘Isn’t that interesting? What is the reaction to that going to be?’” said Steve Roberts, president of the state Chamber of Commerce, which had endorsed Justice’s Republican opponent. Roberts said he considered not attending the inaugural ball. “But at the end of the day, this person is going to be governor for four years, and no one wants to be the one person who is left out.”
He added, “If I had the biggest house in the state and could have people over, I would do it.”
When The Herald-Dispatch newspaper, in Huntington, asked the Ethics Commission about the inaugural, agency staff members said the event fell outside their jurisdiction; the committee members weren’t public officials and they weren’t spending public money.
“A governor becomes subject to the [Ethics] Act when he is sworn in as a public official,” Ethics Commission Executive Director Rebecca Stepto later told the Gazette-Mail and ProPublica.
For Justice, that moment came hours before the Jan. 16, 2017, ceremony at the Capitol. Standing before dozens of spectators in the chapel at The Greenbrier, he took the oath of office just after midnight as his resort livestreamed the event on Facebook.
The Greenbrier’s Twitter account posted a photo of Justice with the hashtag “WVHistory.”
Over the next six months, as Justice served in the governor’s office, the inaugural committee paid his resort more than $800,000 for “entertainment and meals” at the ball.
The Gazette-Mail and ProPublica asked the Ethics Commission if those payments — made after Justice took office — constituted a violation of the West Virginia law that bars public officials from using their office for private gain.
“This is not a situation contemplated or covered by the Ethics Act,” Stepto said in an email response.
State law encourages inaugural committees to zero out their balances by giving to a charity or a special fund aimed at preserving the state’s historic Governor’s Mansion. Justice’s two predecessors, Manchin and Earl Ray Tomblin, both donated tens of thousands of dollars of leftover money to the latter. Justice’s inaugural committee, however, chose another route.
It closed out its accounts on June 1, 2017, with a $113,000 payment to The Greenbrier.


Casey said the inaugural ball likely left the resort with uncompensated expenses. “I think they ended up saying, ‘How much do you have left?’ and they billed us for that amount,” he said.
Cullen, the Justice companies spokesman, would say only that The Greenbrier charged the inaugural committee “negotiated rates,” as he said it does “with any large event.”
“Even the Slightest Whiff of a Conflict Won’t Fly”
Two weeks after he took office, Justice sent a letter to all state employees, seeking to reassure the West Virginia workforce that, as a “full-time” governor, he was dedicated to public service.
“The last thing I want is a conflict of interest between my family’s business and state government,” the letter said. “Even the slightest whiff of a conflict won’t fly with me.”
In an arrangement that echoed that of Trump, Justice said he had put his adult children in charge of day-to-day operations. He also noted that he was exploring a blind trust. But Justice waved off any suggestion of selling his businesses, equating that with shuttering them. “It would mean good people would lose their jobs and that just wouldn’t be right.”
To be sure, West Virginia’s ethics law does not require public officials to divest from their business or financial interests, or to place their holdings into a blind trust; they simply need to report those assets on their annual financial disclosure forms. But historically, governors have taken the extra steps to avoid the appearance of conflicts. Both Jay Rockefeller, heir to an oil fortune, and Gaston Caperton, who owned one of the largest insurance companies in the nation, used blind trusts when they were governor.


Instead, Justice told state employees that he expected them to regulate his businesses like any other. “I assure you,” he wrote in his letter, “there is absolutely no expectation on behalf of the members of my family of receiving any special treatment.”
Two days later, in his first financial disclosure report as governor, Justice reported that The Greenbrier was still doing business with a handful of government agencies. State law prohibits public officials from having a financial interest in government contracts they control, so Justice administration officials said they issued a “moratorium” on state spending at The Greenbrier.
As a result, resort revenue from the state government dropped considerably. “If avoiding conflicts costs the family businesses money,” Cullen said, “they will opt for the ethical decision every time.”
But, according to a ProPublica and Gazette-Mail review of financial data from the West Virginia Auditor’s Office, more than two-dozen state agencies went on to purchase meals and lodging at the resort during Justice’s tenure, spending a combined total of more than $106,000. Colleges and universities accounted for nearly three-quarters of the amount.
Asked about the spending, Brian Abraham, Justice’s general counsel, told the Gazette-Mail that the governor’s office would “re-educate” state agencies on its moratorium, but that it did not have the authority to regulate university outlays. The Ethics Commission seemed to agree, telling West Virginia University that, while college board members are appointed by the governor, they don’t serve at his “will and pleasure,” like other appointees.
Other potential conflicts soon emerged.
In June 2017, the West Virginia Commerce Department sought special permission to restart its sponsorship of The Greenbrier Classic golf tournament. The bid aimed to restore the public funding that Justice had rejected as a candidate the previous summer. In a letter to the Ethics Commission, whose members are appointed by the governor, lawyer Josh Jarrell argued that, without a prominent role in the tournament, the Commerce Department would lose the kind of access it needed to attract firms to West Virginia.


In a sign of the sensitivity of the matter, he noted that the Commerce Department had “not received any requests or direction from the current administration to initiate any efforts” to seek the ethics exemption.
To obtain such waivers, agencies must show the public will suffer “excessive cost, undue hardship or other substantial interference.” Exemptions are more commonly approved for small-town governments, so they can, for example, buy supplies at a local store owned by a council member.
But when news reports emerged describing the administration’s effort to use state money to woo CEOs at the governor’s resort, Justice squashed the Commerce initiative.
“Since I am the governor and have a vested interest in The Greenbrier, I do not want to be involved,” Justice said in a news release. “There is no need to cloud such an important economic and promotional event for our state.”
Still, two months later, the Commerce Department returned to the Ethics Commission with another request. This time, it won approval to spend $5,000 for the registration fee to attend the Chamber of Commerce’s annual Business Summit at The Greenbrier; a portion of the fee went to the resort. Ethics officials, however, refused to allow state funds to be spent for government employees to stay or eat at the property.
Later, the Tourism Office won permission to include The Greenbrier in a new advertising program designed to promote the state’s hospitality industry. Private companies pay for membership and the state matches those contributions. Justice’s hotel soon became the program’s largest participant, kicking in $176,000 for the ad campaign in its first two years.
The Ethics Commission ultimately deferred to the Tourism Office’s argument that The Greenbrier was “key to promoting West Virginia and achieving its mission.” In addition to matching the hotel’s contribution, the agency features the resort as the opening image on its “Where to Stay” website.
“There’s No Point in Dancing Around the Goal”
In August 2017, when Trump came to Huntington, West Virginia, for a political rally, Justice joined him on stage. The governor — “Big Jim,” as the president called him — announced that he was again changing parties, to rejoin the GOP.
Justice told the crowd that he had gone turkey hunting and trout fishing with Donald Trump Jr. and visited the president in the Oval Office.
“This man and myself are not politicians,” Justice said. “We ran to get something done, and we gave up part of our lives. We ran because we want nothing. We ran as our Founding Fathers did years and years ago, to serve.”


Left unspoken was another similarity between the two businessmen-turned-politicians: Their forays into government brought personal profits. Much as foreign dignitaries helped the bottom line for Trump’s hotel in Washington, West Virginia special interests gave The Greenbrier its own boost.
In the Justice era, as government expenditures at the resort dropped, some of the state’s most powerful lobby groups are spending more to host government officials there, according to a Gazette-Mail and ProPublica review of lobbyist disclosure reports filed with the state Ethics Commission.
The Chamber of Commerce and the Coal Association have picked up the tab for a growing number of state officials to attend events at The Greenbrier. The list includes lawmakers, Cabinet secretaries and key staffers in the governor’s office.
Over Labor Day weekend in 2017, for example, after the Ethics Commission warned Commerce Department officials not to spend state money on lodging and meals at the Chamber’s summit, the Chamber covered food for Woody Thrasher, the department’s secretary; Chelsea Ruby, its tourism commissioner; and two officials from its Development Office. (Thrasher, through a spokeswoman, said he didn’t realize the Chamber was paying for his staff’s meals.)
Other beneficiaries included Mike Hall, Justice’s chief of staff. The Chamber paid nearly $1,000 for his two-night stay at The Greenbrier. The group spent another $397 to cover one night for Austin Caperton, Justice’s secretary for the state Department of Environmental Protection. In all, the Chamber doled out nearly $10,000 for 21 state officials to attend its annual meeting — more than three times more than in 2015, before Justice ran for governor.
Likewise, the coal association spent $3,600 for state officials to attend its annual meeting last year, more than twice what it spent in 2015.
These actions are entirely legal. While West Virginia law prohibits public officials from accepting gifts, it allows them to accept “reasonable expenses for food, travel and lodging” for a meeting where the official is a speaker or on a panel.
Abraham, Justice’s general counsel, said the same interactions between state officials and business groups happened under previous administrations, but the state paid the bills back then.
“We certainly can’t control where independent organizations decide to schedule their conferences,” Abraham said this week.
Lobbyists say the increased spending at The Greenbrier has nothing to do with Justice or his ownership of the resort.
“We just try to get people who have some influence over us and who our members might want to hear from,” said Raney, president of the Coal Association. “I can’t tell you there has been any change of mind.”
The Chamber agrees.
“There’s no point in dancing around the goal. The goal is to have a relationship with as many people who are making decisions about the state as we can,” said Roberts, the group’s president. “The ideal would be for the state to make those people available, but that has not been our experience.”
A Helping Hand for The Greenbrier
The 2016 floods precipitated an unraveling at The Greenbrier.
Justice and his hospitality firms became embroiled in a protracted fight with insurers over compensation for storm damage; they later alleged in federal court that the failure to pay $75 million in claims had pushed The Greenbrier to “near financial insolvency.” (The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed on a technicality.)
At the same time, the resort struggled to find the money to sponsor The Greenbrier Classic, and it lost its prime Fourth of July placement on the PGA Tour schedule.


Amid the financial scramble, in May 2018, Justice announced a new effort that he said would “help to revitalize many areas across West Virginia.”
Opportunity zones were the result of Trump’s federal tax overhaul; governors in each state could select a certain number of poor census tracts, and investors who supported projects in those areas would be eligible for lucrative tax credits.
“This is more great news for our state,” Justice said, releasing a list of 55 opportunity zones.
At the bottom of the first page was the city of White Sulphur Springs, the storm-ravaged home of The Greenbrier. Local officials who applied for the program are hoping it brings new shops and other businesses to a downtown area struggling to rebuild after the flood. But Samantha Jacoby, a tax analyst who has studied opportunity zones for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, says the designation could also benefit Justice and his resort.
Some sites in other opportunity zones, she noted, have seen rising property values and could have easier access to credit. And while firms that operate “sin” businesses, such as casinos and liquor stores, face restrictions, some have found loopholes. “It’s not, I don’t think, what was intended,” Jacoby said.
Cullen declined to comment on the governor’s selection.
That same month, Justice sought to advance a separate tax plan to boost the resort.
He wanted Greenbrier County to divert as much as $10 million in property tax revenue to help finance various resort projects, including a ski area and a new laundry. Because Justice owned the resort and the deal would need to be approved by his Commerce Department, he sought an advisory opinion from the Ethics Commission.
But, in an illustration of how the governor’s administration and his business empire can work hand in hand to advance Justice’s corporate agenda, the governor did not write the letter.
According to public records and interviews, Greenbrier lawyers penned the request to the Ethics Commission and took it to the governor’s office, where staff copied it onto the governor’s letterhead, and Justice signed it. While Justice’s resort would benefit from the tax deal, the letter said, “the real winner would no doubt be the residents of Greenbrier County,” who would see a surge in jobs.


About a week later, Justice, withdrew his request. His note on state stationery was relayed to ethics officials by a Greenbrier lawyer.
The resort, however, forged ahead, with its executives seeking to enlist the help of local officials. Larry Klein, vice president and general manager of The Greenbrier Sporting Club, drafted a letter for county commissioners in support of Justice’s proposal — and then asked them to send it to the Ethics Commission under their own names. Much of the document’s language was taken verbatim from the governor’s aborted request.
The county officials declined to send the letter. They said they wanted to spend the tax dollars on other projects, like water and sewer construction, that would help average residents.
Commission President Lowell Rose, who owns a local construction company, said the decision was difficult.
“You have additional pressure you wouldn’t have if he wasn’t the biggest business owner in the area and also the governor,” Rose said.
The Feds Move In
Early in his tenure, Justice placed some of his smaller holdings into a blind trust. And a lawyer for the governor promised the Ethics Commission that Justice would soon add The Greenbrier, among other businesses, to the list, as soon as agreements could be worked out with various lenders.
But well into his third year in office, Justice has abandoned that pledge.
Abraham, the governor’s general counsel, now says a blind trust would be a “facade.”
Cullen added, “Placing The Greenbrier in a blind trust makes no sense because the Governor knows the family owns the business.”
Regardless, federal criminal investigators are looking into the administration’s interactions with The Greenbrier, especially regarding the golf tournament. Among the people whose communications were targeted in the March subpoena: Justice, his children and several resort executives.
The governor pledged to cooperate with the inquiry.
“I’ve always done the right thing in my personal life, my business life, my political life and every part of my life,” Justice said in a statement at the time. “The people of West Virginia know that I have always been an open book, so of course, I am fully cooperating with the investigation.”
At the same time, the governor faces mounting political opposition.


A leading state Democratic lawmaker has sued Justice for living in Greenbrier County, arguing that the West Virginia Constitution requires the governor to reside in Charleston. The lawsuit could be a vehicle to force Justice to turn over a variety of records, including his income tax returns, which, like Trump, the governor refused to make public during the 2016 election.
And Manchin, who continues to hint he will return from the U.S. Senate to seek another term as governor, is far from the only one-time ally who has turned on Justice. In April, Thrasher, Justice’s former Commerce secretary, announced that he would challenge the governor in next year’s Republican primary. Thrasher, owner of a large engineering firm with many state contracts, recently tweeted that, if elected, he would put his holdings into a blind trust.
“Public servants should make decisions 100% based on the citizens they are elected to serve,” he wrote, “and business interests should never be a factor.”
Justice is pressing forward, though, linking what could be good for The Greenbrier with what also would be good for West Virginia.
In late June, he signed a number of bills the Legislature had passed at his urging during a special session. The governor’s office said the package would “provide better opportunities for West Virginians.” Among the measures was House Bill 113, giving additional state tax breaks for investments in “opportunity zones,” like the one that includes The Greenbrier.

251,"Yes, Donald Trump Is Rooting for Break-up of the EU",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/yes-donald-trump-is-rooting-for-break-up-of-the-eu/,"Of course Donald Trump is hoping for a dissolution of the European Union, and it’s not a secret.
When you’re talking about geopolitical powers, three most immediately spring to mind: the United States, the European Union, and China. It’s fair to say that the US has to look at the latter two as economic competitors, at least in terms of their potential for growth and development.

Brexit gave Trump a gift he could never have hoped to have: a lever by which he could play around with the integrity of the EU, hoping to see the world’s biggest international alliance dissolve. If the UK managed to draw away successfully (which is part of why Trump keeps floating a positive deal for the UK Post-Brexit, to make it seem that much more appealing), others might be encouraged to do the same, and that could end up neutralising one of the US’ biggest competitors.
You’ll also note that he’s simultaneously (and unsuccessfully) trying to neutralise China into the bargain, but part of the issue with Trump is that he doesn’t understand the complexity of what is involved. The Chinese are beating him at every turn, and the EU isn’t looking likely to dissolve any time soon, particularly when even Brexit has stalled, and the US economy is similarly showing signs of an economic downturn — with GDP predicted to fall, and the stock market taking several tumbles in recent weeks.

Fortunately, things which are a priority for Donald Trump are not a priority for the rest of the world, and there’s little likelihood that his desires will be enacted by the time his tenure in office is over.

252,The Case That Made an Ex-ICE Attorney Realize the Government Was Relying on False ‘Evidence’ Against Migrants,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/the-case-that-made-an-ex-ice-attorney-realize-the-government-was-relying-on-false-evidence-against-migrants/,"Originally Published on Propublica.
Laura Peña could see that her 36-year-old client was wasting away. Gaunt and haggard after nearly two months in jail, he ran his fingers through his hair and opened his hands to show her the clumps that were falling out. He was so distraught that his two young children had been taken from him at the border, he could barely speak without weeping.
After Carlos requested political asylum, border and immigration agents had accused him of being a member of the notorious MS-13 gang in El Salvador — a criminal not fit to enter the United States. But as Peña looked at him, she saw none of the typical hallmarks of gang membership: the garish MS-13 tattoos or a criminal record back home. He was the sole caregiver for his 7-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter. He’d even brought an official letter from El Salvador’s Justice Ministry certifying that he’d never been in jail. Something else about his case bothered her, too: She’d been peppering the government’s lawyers with phone calls and emails for weeks and they’d yet to reveal any evidence to back up their accusation.


Unlike most attorneys working pro bono to reunite families, Peña was familiar with MS-13, because she’d pursued the deportation of gang members as a trial attorney for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She understood how the system worked, because she’d been a part of it. Her long tumble of curly hair, which makes her look younger than her 37 years, is paired with a forthright-bordering-on-blunt manner of speaking forged from her years as a prosecutor on the front line of the immigration debate. She was empathetic toward the plight of clients like Carlos, whose last name is not being used for his protection. But she was also unwilling to give any of them false hope. If Carlos was a gang member, his chance for asylum was zero.
“There has to be a mistake,” Carlos insisted that December day from behind the scratched plexiglass wall in the visitor’s room at the jail. “Please help me.” Looking at him, Peña wanted to help. But the system she’d once known, as flawed as it was, had turned into a black box she no longer understood, with an ever-shifting array of rules and policies that granted untold discretion to the government. She couldn’t even get ICE attorneys to comply with a fundamental tenet of a fair system: providing proof of their case, evidence they could fight against.
To Peña and her colleagues, cases like Carlos’ signaled a troubling new era.
Years of legal precedent had been swept away by Trump administration efforts to push through evermore harsh immigration policies like family separation. Then, when the courts pushed back and the policies were publicly rescinded, the administration discovered new ways to quietly continue them. She and her colleagues were counting hundreds of new cases of family separation along the border that occurred after the “zero tolerance” policy supposedly ended in June 2018. But no one could track what the government was doing with every case.
Now here was Carlos, who simply looked like a grief-stricken dad. Peña had been skeptical of him at first. When they’d met in November 2018, all she knew was that he was considered such a threat that ICE and Customs and Border Protection had put him in the wing of the Laredo, Texas, jail designated for violent offenders. She’d used her ICE training to poke at his story, searching for inconsistencies, signs he was lying. “Trust but verify” was her guiding principle. She’d gone over his background with him multiple times, his story about why he’d fled El Salvador and his former life as a warehouse manager for an architectural design company. She’d made him retrace his story over and over until she was satisfied.
As a pro bono attorney working for the nonprofit legal group Texas Civil Rights Project, Peña had a growing stack of cases on her desk. She’d spent the last six months monitoring “zero tolerance” prosecutions at the courthouse, searching for unlawful separations. Her mandate was simply to reunify Carlos with his children. He was luckier than most; he had her asking questions on his behalf. The majority of migrants who are arrested at the border never see a lawyer, let alone understand how to fight the allegations against them. Carlos was one drop in a river of cases.
But something about his case made her want to dig deeper. What wasn’t the government telling them?
Raised in Harlingen, Texas, just a short drive from Mexico, Peña went to school with friends who were undocumented and friends whose parents worked for the Border Patrol and Immigration and Naturalization Services. She grew up steeped in the culture from both sides of the border. As soon as she graduated from high school, she left the border, earning a place at the prestigious Wellesley College and then landing a job in the State Department, where she focused on security and human rights in Central America.
But Peña longed to follow in her father’s footsteps and become a lawyer, so she took night classes at Georgetown Law. After graduating, desperate for courtroom experience, she learned that ICE was looking for trial attorneys. Peña wasn’t sure she was up to the task of deporting people. Most of her family and the few friends she told were appalled at the notion. And she kept her plans secret from friends in the immigrant advocacy world, fearing they would never speak to her again. But her father, who had also been a struggling new attorney once, understood her dilemma better than most. “Do what you need to do,” he counseled her. “Don’t worry about what others think.” A mentor, who was also an immigration attorney, encouraged her to take the job and try to make ICE a more humane agency from within. “We need people of your mindset working on the government’s side,” she told Peña.


Peña was hired in 2014 and moved to Los Angeles. It was the start of President Barack Obama’s mandate that ICE attorneys exercise their prosecutorial discretion in the courtroom. This meant that Peña could look at each case on its own merit and focus on deporting criminals while giving families who qualified for asylum or legal residency an option to stay. She says she tried to wield the incredible power she’d been granted with fairness and careful consideration, which made her proud. But her idealism was short-lived. Case by case, she said, she gradually lost her sense that she could be a positive force in an immigration system already in free fall. One day in court, she was asked to handle the case of a 6-month-old baby who was scheduled for deportation. Somewhere in the overwhelmed system, the baby’s case had been separated from that of his mother’s, who sat in the courtroom weeping. Furious, the judge said such a slip up could result in a 6-month-old being deported without his mother. Peña was horrified and embarrassed. She tied the two case folders together with a rubber band and wrote “family unit” at the top in red pen — it wasn’t the first time that ICE’s computer system had failed her — and assured the judge they wouldn’t be separated again.
Then there was one particularly devastating court hearing, at which she found herself arguing that an African woman who had been brutally raped and attacked by a militia in her home country should not be granted asylum because she had a fraudulent identification paper.
As the judge ordered her deportation, the woman had a full-blown panic attack, falling to the ground, beating her chest and wailing, “No! No!” Peña knew she would never forget how the woman had looked up at her with pleading eyes and begged, “Please help me.”
There were other cases, too, each taking a toll, until it just got to be too much. On her worst days, she said, she felt that nothing she’d done, or could do, made a difference. Everything was stacked against the immigrants. Most couldn’t afford to hire an attorney. Few would ever win their cases. She was participating in a system that refused to provide due process. Sometimes she wondered if she’d helped send the African woman to her death. The guilt lingered in the back of her mind.
So she quit. She took a well-paying corporate job in California as a business immigration lawyer, helping companies hire foreign workers. But when family separations made headlines in the summer of 2018, she felt the pull to dive back in, to try and level the odds. She left her lucrative corporate job and, at age 35, moved back in with her parents in South Texas. She took a job as a modestly paid visiting attorney for TCRP, which had an office near the federal courthouse in McAllen, Texas.
She’d been away from the border for nearly 20 years. What she found on her return was chaos: overwhelmed federal public defenders anxiously searching for the children of their clients, who were being prosecuted in criminal court under Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy. Peña and her colleagues at the nonprofit got to work interviewing parents and trying to track down their children who’d been shipped off without paperwork connecting them to their families. She remembered the 6-month-old she’d represented in removal proceedings. Back then, family separations were relatively rare. Now it was official policy with no plan in place to reunify the families.
It had taken her more than a week to locate Carlos’ children. She found them in a government shelter outside Corpus Christi, Texas, a two-hour drive from Laredo. She spent an additional two weeks negotiating with officials from ICE and the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the children’s shelters, to allow a phone call between Carlos and his kids. The phone call had alleviated some of his anxiety, but it had also been agonizing. His 11-year-old daughter had cried throughout and begged him to come and get them.
His estranged wife, who is also undocumented and lives in Washington state, had applied for custody. But ICE needed to conduct a background check and take her fingerprints before the children could be released.


Carlos’ wife had emailed Peña a photo of Carlos with his two children, all sporting big grins. They looked so happy together. Maybe it was the photograph, or the rapport she’d developed with him, or the gang accusation based on some mysterious (and she believed false) evidence, but Peña believed he deserved another chance.
Without the accusation, Carlos and his children would likely have been processed like other asylum-seekers and released with a court date before a judge or would have been detained together at a family shelter. Now ICE could quickly deport him.
She would have to take on his asylum case herself, but she couldn’t do it alone. She’d need to persuade other attorneys — from firms with deep pockets — to volunteer to join the case. It also meant putting her reputation at risk if she was wrong about Carlos. Luckily, a number of such firms had stepped forward that summer to offer assistance to the small nonprofits on the front lines fighting family separation.
Christmas was drawing near by the time of her visit with Carlos when he, emaciated in his red prison jumpsuit, showed her the clumps of hair that were falling out. The four-hour drive from her parents’ home in Brownsville to the Laredo jail was starting to become routine. Every time her mother’s old Nissan pickup truck, which had already surpassed 150,000 miles, sputtered and rattled on the highway, she’d turn up Spanish pop music to drown out the noise.
That day Carlos was a bundle of fears: of never seeing his children again, of the wrath of the gang members back in El Salvador who’d threatened to kill his family when he couldn’t meet their extortion demands. In their eyes, he told her, he had disobeyed their authority by fleeing the country, which was punishable by death.
“We only came to this country because we had no other choice,” she said Carlos told her, shouting to be heard through the plexiglass barrier because the jail phones were out of order again. “They threatened to kill my kids.”
“I believe you,” Peña told him, pressing her hand firmly against the plexiglass. “What’s been done to you is a grave injustice. And I’m here, and I’m going to help you.”
Her colleagues at TCRP quickly agreed that Carlos’ case was egregious enough to warrant their limited time and resources if she could persuade a larger firm to help. They’d heard of other families separated at the border because of vague gang allegations and wanted answers just as badly as she did. That night, she sent out an SOS to a handful of firms more accustomed to representing Fortune 500 companies and politicians than penniless fathers in immigration detention. Attached to her email was the photo of Carlos with his kids. Peña was direct in her plea for help. “Let’s reunify this family before Christmas,” she wrote. “Who’s going to join me?”
Christmas passed, then New Year’s. During the day, Peña strategized on Carlos’ case and others at TCRP. At night, she worked in her father’s home office on a report documenting the hundreds of family separations she and her colleagues had uncovered. Many of the separations were, like Carlos’, based on vague allegations of gang membership or an alleged criminal past. A rambunctious blue heeler, which she’d adopted and named Dulce after the dog showed up on her parents’ doorstep, was her only distraction. She missed baby showers and birthdays and ducked out of dinner invitations from a friend who complained that she might as well have stayed in California.


Peña was growing increasingly outraged that Carlos was still in jail, without evidence. To make matters worse, a government shutdown loomed, which meant the attorneys in charge of Carlos’ case were no longer getting back to her.
A corporate law firm, Haynes and Boone, had answered her SOS, volunteering to help pro bono. (Haynes and Boone separately represents ProPublica in a libel case.) The firm had offices around the globe and exactly the kind of legal muscle she needed. A team of lawyers swung into action filing an emergency motion requesting that Carlos’ deportation be stayed and that his asylum claim be reconsidered. The motion also requested that he be reunited with his children while his case went through the legal process. A judge immediately granted the stay, which bought them some time.
But by now the government had ground to a halt, while President Donald Trump bickered with Congress over the building of a border wall. The prosecutor handling Carlos’ case informed Peña that his complaint would go to the back of the line while the Department of Justice worked on emergency cases, such as land condemnations to build the wall.
Carlos wouldn’t be deported in the coming days, thanks to the judge’s ruling, but he’d remain in jail for the foreseeable future.
Peña was worried about Carlos’ children. They’d now been locked away in a shelter for more than two months — and she worried that each additional day traumatized them further. To put Carlos’ mind at ease, and hers, she drove two hours to the shelter in Driscoll, a rural town outside Corpus Christi, to reassure them that she was doing everything she could to reunify them with their dad.
In the visiting room, the children used the crayons, pens and paper Peña brought to draw pictures for Carlos. His daughter looked painfully thin and sad, while his son tried to put on a brave face to keep his sister from crying. It was hard for Peña not to cry herself as she sat down at the table with them.
“Why can’t we be with our father?” she recalled the girl asking.
“I’m your dad’s lawyer, and we’re working on getting him out of jail,” Peña told her. “There was some confusion when you crossed the border.”
“Oh, they thought he was a gang member,” the girl said matter-of-factly, drawing a careful outline on her piece of paper.


Peña, who doesn’t have children herself, was reminded of how observant they could be. “Do you think your dad is a gang member?” she asked, watching the little girl’s face for a reaction.
“No,” she said, shaking her head. She began to cry. Peña noticed that she had drawn a picture of a family together, holding hands.
“Well, I don’t think so either,” Peña told her. “And that’s why we’re going to fight to get your dad out.”
When Peña left the government shelter, she climbed in to her mother’s old pickup in the parking lot, cranked up the air conditioning and cried.
With a pending deportation order, Carlos had run out of options in immigration court. Peña and the Haynes and Boone legal team would have to take his case to federal court. They decided to challenge Carlos’ separation from his children on constitutional grounds in Washington, D.C. Since the wholesale separation of families under Trump had unfolded, a handful of cases had been litigated there on the unconstitutionality of the separations. And more important, U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman had ruled that a woman from El Salvador, whose attorneys said had been falsely accused of being a gang member, should be reunited with her 4-year-old son.
They hoped the judge would do the same for Carlos.
The government still hadn’t allowed her to review a key document known as an I-213 form, though she had requested it several times. Similar to a police report, the form would show the various databases Carlos’ name had been run through at the Border Patrol processing facility and what they’d found. The attorneys filed a Freedom of Information request with the Department of Homeland Security requesting Carlos’ file. But from experience, Peña knew it would probably take several months, which was little help to them now.
Her hunch was that the faulty gang intelligence had come from El Salvador. But not knowing from where in El Salvador made it nearly impossible to find an investigator there who could dig up anything useful in helping clear Carlos’ name.
Just when she felt at a dead end, Carlos’ mother and father offered to help. Throughout January, the elderly couple crisscrossed San Salvador, the capital, by bus, visiting one government agency after another with little success. Finally, at the federal court, which holds criminal records and arrest warrants, his parents made a compelling discovery: A man with nearly the same name as their son, with an identical date of birth, had a warrant out for his arrest as a gang member.
Their finding bolstered Peña’s theory that it was a case of mistaken identity. She had Carlos’ mother give a sworn declaration to a lawyer in El Salvador about their finding, then submitted it as evidence in their case.
If the government had made a mistake, there must be a way to clear Carlos’ name. On Feb. 12, she was finally rewarded with a clue. In response to their suit, ICE submitted an affidavit from Mellissa B. Harper, an official with the agency who oversees the family shelters. Harper said she’d reviewed “documents and electronic records” that revealed that Carlos had a documented affiliation with MS-13. “This information was entered into the U.S. government databases by the U.S. Department of State and local U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation operating in El Salvador.”
As an ICE attorney, Peña was familiar with databases kept by CBP, and she knew that the FBI had been running gang task forces for several years in El Salvador, but why was the State Department entering information about Carlos’ supposed gang membership? Her area of expertise when she’d worked there had been Central America, but she’d never heard of the State Department sharing intelligence with DHS to deport people at the border.
Peña emailed the few contacts she still had at the department, but no one responded. She found only the barest descriptions online. In May 2017, the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs had created and funded a new gang intelligence center based in El Salvador. It was called the Grupo Conjunto de Inteligencia Fronteriza, or GCIF, and it worked in tandem with DHS and the FBI’s gang task force in Central America.
There was only a brief mention of the center’s activities in the public record. In January 2018, Richard H. Glenn, acting deputy assistant secretary of state for the bureau, told the House Homeland Security Subcommittee that Salvadoran police officers had been sent to the border in McAllen for eight months in 2017 to “help DHS, state and local law enforcement identify, arrest or deny entry to gang members.”
The 10 police officers became part of a permanent team in El Salvador, which also included five migration officials and two corrections officers who worked alongside U.S. agents from DHS. In less than a year, Glenn said, the program had allowed them to identify “240 MS-13 members not previously known to U.S. law enforcement, and 46 not previously known to Salvadoran authorities.”


Peña wondered whether Carlos was counted among those MS-13 members Glenn had mentioned in his testimony. She knew there was probably no way to confirm it. She noted that the pilot project had taken place at the same Border Patrol station in McAllen where Carlos had been accused of being a gang member, and where his children were taken away. (CBP referred questions to the State Department. A State Department spokesperson would not comment on Carlos specifically but said the program has shown “concrete, positive results and helped identify over 5,000 total subjects with a criminal history.”)
Peña found a photograph online of the DHS secretary at the time, Kirstjen Nielsen, presenting an award to CBP and Salvadoran officers in Washington, D.C., with a dedication that read: “In recognition of dedicated bi-national efforts focused on sharing information to identify Central American gang members attempting to make illegal entry into the United States.”
But what about those who had been falsely accused?
Back in Washington, Friedman set Carlos’ hearing for Feb. 21, but the DOJ attorneys balked, saying the case wasn’t a priority for them as they worked through the backlog from the government shutdown. They wanted to postpone the hearing until at least March.
They still refused to provide any of the evidence linking Carlos with MS-13 or to even discuss it. At least Peña could take comfort in the fact that his children had finally been released to their mother.
Peña argued that Carlos’ health was deteriorating and that she feared for his mental state if he stayed incarcerated much longer. The government allowed the Feb. 21 hearing to go ahead.
On the morning of the hearing, the team of six lawyers, including Peña, met on the front steps of the federal courthouse. Paloma Ahmadi, a young attorney with Haynes and Boone, would argue the case before the judge along with Peña. Peña and Ahmadi greeted each other warmly — it was the first time they’d met in person.
In the weeks leading up to the hearing, Peña had gotten little sleep. Her report for the TCRP documenting the hundreds of new family separation cases had been released a week earlier, sounding the alarm that the government was still systematically removing children from their parents, often based on dubious evidence that the government never provided. In July 2019, the American Civil Liberties Union would further confirm her findings, documenting that more than 900 parents and children had been separated since Trump had supposedly ended the practice a year earlier.
Ahmadi and Peña laid out the evidence of Carlos’ innocence before the court: the certified letter from the Justice Ministry stating he had no criminal record, a letter from his former employer attesting to his good moral character and the sworn affidavit from Carlos’ mother about her findings in San Salvador.
After they finished, Friedman turned to the two attorneys representing the government. “At this point, the evidence that the plaintiff has presented from El Salvador shows, does it not, that he has no criminal record and no convictions?” he asked.
“That is the evidence that they presented, yes,” said one of the attorneys.
“Do you contest that?” the judge asked.
“No,” she said, pausing. “But he was identified in two separate databases, which prevent him from being housed in a family residential center. … [HHS] have explicit requirements that say a gang affiliation is a bar to housing.”
Peña puzzled over the government’s argument. The lawyers acknowledged that Carlos wasn’t a criminal, then insisted he was a gang member because the government databases said so. But they wouldn’t discuss the nature of the evidence these databases contained. Peña supposed one of the databases was the one the Border Patrol used for background checks.
But the other had to be the State Department’s new gang intelligence gathering initiative. That raised a bunch of questions that no one appeared willing to address or even let her ask. Did the center collect biometric evidence, like fingerprints, she wondered, or just names Salvadoran police had turned over? And how were they vetting the information from police? She herself had helped author reports, while working at the State Department, documenting corruption and human rights abuses committed by the police in El Salvador. (The DOJ and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. A State Department spokesperson said that each analyst at the center is vetted as required by law.)
“Your Honor,” Peña said, addressing the judge, “as a former ICE trial attorney, whenever I had evidence in immigration court that questioned whether or not some of the documentation … was inaccurate, we were required as officers of the court to go back and do our due diligence. What I find surprising here is that we don’t even have some of the basic evidence.”
“You asked for it in writing?” Friedman asked.
“Yes, your honor. The government refused to provide any documentation.”


“All right, well file a motion for discovery,” he said, dryly.
She wondered why she had to file a motion in the first place, when the government should have been upfront with her, sharing its evidence against her client. Throughout the hearing, the government prosecutors refused to budge from their stance that Carlos was a threat and should be deported. By the end, Peña felt deflated. She’d taken Carlos’ case all the way to federal court in Washington. Friedman was not going to give them the reunification they had hoped for. The judge reasoned that it had already occurred since the children had been released to their mother. And Carlos, he said, would surely be deported anyway, so what was the point?
After the Washington, D.C., hearing, the legal team was in uncharted territory. There was very little legal precedent for reunification in family separation cases, so they would have to be creative. Peña went to visit Carlos in jail to break the news that it had not gone as well as they’d hoped. They would now go back to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, she told him, which handles issues of asylum and citizenship and ask again for another credible fear interview. They would throw themselves at the mercy of the government. If he passed, he could be released on bond.
But it would all be up to the government’s discretion. In essence, one giant gamble. Carlos, who vacillated daily between hope and despair, thanked Peña for her efforts. She’d spent so many sleepless nights on this case, and now it felt like they were starting over. Carlos, she feared, was starting to doubt her and the legal team.
Three more weeks passed, then Peña received a call. Against all odds, the government was granting Carlos one more chance at asylum. A few days later, the two sat on separate phone lines — Carlos in Laredo and she in her office at TCRP — talking for three-and-a-half hours with an asylum officer in Houston, going step by step through Carlos’ case. At the end, the officer agreed he had a valid claim.
Now Carlos would be eligible for release on bond, which meant he might finally get out of jail. And he wouldn’t be deported until his asylum case had been heard by a judge. He was finally getting the legal due process that Peña had fought so hard for all these months.
On May 1, six months after he was jailed, Carlos appeared on a video screen in a nearly empty immigration courtroom in San Antonio for his bond hearing. Peña — clasping folders filled with the evidence she’d collected — sat next to another lawyer from Haynes and Boone in front of the judge’s bench. Opposite them sat a lone ICE attorney whom Peña had never met.
She felt herself growing tense, as she sized up the ICE attorney and the files stacked in front of him on the table.
The immigration judge asked Peña whether Carlos had passed his credible fear interview.
“Yes, your honor,” she said.
The judge asked the ICE attorney whether he objected to releasing Carlos on bond.
“No, your Honor,” he said.
Peña was shocked. After the hearing in Washington, she’d expected the ICE attorney to be just as tough. But he didn’t even mention the gang allegation. Within 15 minutes, the hearing was over and Carlos was granted a $7,500 bond. Outside in the hallway, she hugged the attorney from Haynes and Boone and blinked back tears. She couldn’t wait to witness Carlos’ first moments of freedom.


Six days later, Peña met Carlos at the Laredo bus station with her mom, who had wanted to meet him after so many months of his case absorbing her daughter’s life. Peña drove him back to Brownsville in her mom’s much nicer SUV, where he spent the night in a hotel before flying to Washington state to reunite with his kids.
On the drive, Carlos was emotional and kept thanking her, but they also simply chatted and laughed. Peña had never seen the more joyous side of his personality. It made her joyous as well.
But after his plane took off for Washington, her celebratory mood flagged. She’d learned through more research that the State Department’s gang intelligence center had recently expanded to Guatemala, Mexico and Honduras. And that it was also growing its network in the United States. They’d only discovered the bad intelligence from El Salvador because they’d taken Carlos’ case to court, which had required a team of lawyers and cost upward of $100,000. Even with that, she still hadn’t been able to view the evidence, and the database was still largely a secret to the world. As far as she knew, Carlos’ name was still listed, and she had learned it was up to the accused to convince law enforcement in their home country to correct any false information — a nearly impossible task.
She wondered how many more parents were out there falsely accused and separated from their kids. It was a constant struggle to balance her concerns with what she was actually capable of achieving. Carlos still had an asylum claim to pursue, and the gang allegation could still be lurking in the background, ready to jeopardize everything.
After she saw Carlos off at the airport, Peña drove home. Before it got dark, she’d go horseback riding to try and forget for a few moments about whether Carlos would ever really find peace, to forget about the stacks of cases gathering on her father’s desk at home and about the others that would surely come — and would keep coming. She consoled herself with the thought that despite the odds against them, they’d tipped the scale of justice toward Carlos. He’d gotten a second chance.

253,"Recession: ‘It’s Here,’ and First Casualties Are Reps. Omar, Tlaib",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/recession-its-here-and-first-casualties-are-reps-omar-tlaib/,"The recession long feared for the US economy? “It’s here,” according to at least one economic analyst.
And Donald Trump’s push on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bar two members of Congress from Israel is a direct response, to try to change the subject of the headlines away from the nation’s troubled economy, political analysts and others said.
Moves in the bond and stock markets, as well as other indicators in recent days, and CNN economic analyst Rana Foroohar believes that the recession is here.
“It’s here. And in fact, I said that on Sunday in a column. I’m not sure whether to be happy I’m right or devastated my retirement savings has gone down,” she said.

“The official arbiters of whether we are in a recession or not have not yet decreed anything and they generally don’t until long after something has happened, so I don’t want to get ahead of the keys,” she added. “There are a lot of things that are worrying about the data. I think the things that are most concerning to me are not whether we’ll fall into a recession which eventually we will, the business cycle turns. That’s why it’s a cycle. The real concern is how badly it will be mismanaged. I think that’s part of what markets are freaking out about right now.”
Credit so far for the economy is the only area where Trump gets positive marks from the general American public. So a recession could be a disaster for his re-election chances next year.
To deal with it, Trump is trying to shift blame onto the Federal Reserve, but the Fed has very little room left to help, according to former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.
“Just look at the way long-term yields are less than short-term yields. Look at the decline in the stock market. Look at what’s happening to the manufacturing sector of our economy. Look at what’s happening abroad. Look at what’s happening to business intentions. These are the kinds of things that tend to precede recessions,” Summers said. “I don’t know whether it’s just above or just below 50/50 that a recession will start in the next year, but that’s the range we’re in. And it’s hard for people to have confidence in the resilience of the economy; hard because interest rates are so low that there’s not much room for the fed to cut them further.” 
Moreover, Trump late this week tried to change the news altogether by pressuring Netanyahu to bar Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan from making a planned congressional trip to Israel.
Both are Muslim and have been targets of racist attacks by Trump in recent weeks.
“And folks, if the culture wars is the yin of the president’s re-election strategy, if you want to call it that, the economy is the yang. Which is why it is not lost on a lot of us that the president’s attacks on Omar and Tlaib conveniently came as the economy became the story because it was showing signs of slowing,” said MSNBC host Chuck Todd. “The president is lashing out at the Fed. He’s lashing out at the press after what was a brutal day of headlines involving the health of the economy, particularly due to his policies in China and it potentially imperils one of the most important pitches that he has on the campaign trail.”

Journalist Elise Jordan agreed that an economic crunch would spell political disaster for Trump.
“It’s political suicide. His political strength is premised on the idea that he has maintained and protected and cultivated a strong economy. His supporters and attractors overall agree that the economy has been pretty good the entire time of his presidency, whether it began with [President Barack] Obama, that’s another debate,” she said. “But you talk to voters and they love the economy right now. And that drops off it becomes much harder to excuse away the underlying instating in Donald Trump’s statements. There no longer is the excuse: ‘I’m a Republican who supports Trump because I like the economy.’ That’s a lot harder to say.”

254,The Debate: We Don’t Want Someone Just to Beat Trump,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-debate-we-dont-want-someone-just-to-beat-trump/,"I’m 19 years old, and earlier in the month attended a national conference for a youth organization that I am a part of. We had somewhere near 300 attendees from across the country – all young people wanting to shift our politics for the sake of our future.
On Monday night, we watched night one of the debate together, and while the performance of the candidates was, to me, almost entirely predictable, what was not was predictable was the general magnitude, but more importantly direction of the passionate outcry that I saw from our room of 300+ young people. 
It is no secret that as young people, everywhere on the political spectrum, we are a fired up, passionate new base of voters. Across the country we are seeing my generation shift the national conversation on issues like gun violence prevention and environmental justice in intersectional manners that we’ve never before seen. We are the most populous voting base in this country. Prior to the recent midterms, young people (considered 18-24) historically showed up to the polls at a rate of one in five.

But here’s where it gets interesting: showing up to the polls at a rate of two in five numerically gives us the power to swing any race. And with what was essentially the highest youth voter turnout in the history of this country last November, the opinions and output of the young people in this country, who are more engaged than ever before, is something you’re downright foolish to ignore. 
So here is both a young person’s perspective on what went down, as well as the collective reception in a room of 300 passionate young voters.
It’s safe to say that in this room of 300, almost everybody leans further left than myself. Despite what is a common, and justifiable topic of discussion right now, I can say boldly that my generation is not choosing who we vote for in the primaries with a “Who can beat Trump?” mindset. Adults can tell me that the Democrats need to stand united against Donald Trump in these debates, specifically on key issues like healthcare, rather than use debate time to attack the plans of one another. I couldn’t disagree more. For any American feeling disdain, disgust, or dissatisfaction with the Trump presidency, it is no secret that this a crucial turning point in this country.
There is no middle ground — you’re either in a camp of people who love the work this administration is doing, or you are ashamed, scared, and very much dissatisfied with that very work. For every American in the latter group; it will be a disservice to this nation if we strive for “better” rather than “best” from the most diverse and talented field of candidates we’ve ever had such a unique opportunity to chose between. It’s simply not about what can be seen as advantageous for Donald Trump right now.

So no, it is not the time for the Democrats to stand as one happy family when we discuss healthcare during these debates. Healthcare is the number one issue amongst Democratic voters. Exactly where and how these candidates differ on this policy must be something distinguishable. Right now, there are twenty candidates to take the stage. An undecided Democratic voter needs to know these very distinctions in order to feel confident in making an informed decision. If healthcare is the number one issue for Democratic voters, then they don’t want “better,” they want “best.” And I can tell you with confidence, that despite where we may differ on policy, as passionate young people seeking revolution within our politics, we are looking for “best.” And it’s a search that we won’t take lightly. 
Despite her momentum, the thunderous applause Elizabeth Warren received in this crowded room was something that I (naively?) did not expect. We all know that Elizabeth Warren is a rockstar among the “ultra-progressives.” But even Bernie Sanders, who rivals Warren as far as who is most “progressive,” was notably booed by the people around me when walking on to the stage. As similar as they are on policy, the vast majority of what Sanders argued throughout the debate got passionate applause like Warren.
The same people who “booed” as he walked on stage were cheering in agreement with what he had to say. And it comes as no surprise as he and Warren are preaching to the same choir. But what is striking in this situation is how, unlike Sanders, Warren’s mere presence received applause and passion not dissimilar to that for which you see in concert venues or sports arenas. In fact, many in attendance took to Instagram later to point out this very thing, one person even referring to the group’s’ reception of Warren as being reminiscent of a football game.

When Warren would speak, the applause was continuously so boisterous that I had to go back and rewatch much of the debate on my own to be able to hear the ends of her sentences. Staunch Kamala supporters can tell me that this is not truly indicative of anything major, but I can only really tell you what I know and saw to be true: in a room of roughly 300 young voters – many of whom had not met before the conference – the support for Elizabeth Warren was not only overwhelmingly passionate but frankly, almost unanimous. Warren is a force to be reckoned with — and that is becoming increasingly evident with each passing day.

255,"Fear of Recession Continues to Loom, Triggering Stock Selloff",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/fear-of-recession-continues-to-loom-triggering-stock-selloff/,"US markets have all opened lower today due to fears over the increased possibility of a US recession in the next 12-18 months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (The Dow) is down by around 2.89% this morning while the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 indices are all down by 2.47% and 2.51% respectively. 
This selloff in the markets is largely attributed to the increased trade tensions between the US and China as well as the inversion of the yield curve in US Treasury bonds.  

In simple terms, bond yields are the profits that investors earn when buying bonds from the U.S. Government. These bonds are offered with different maturities (contract lengths) ranging from 2 years up to 30 years. In normal times the longer the maturity a bond has, the bigger the yield that the investor can expect to earn. This is referred to as the yield curve. However, there are certain times when the yield curve inverts meaning that shorter-term bonds have a higher yield than their longer-term counterparts.
When the yield curve inverts it is almost always a surefire indicator that a recession is coming soon and this is what has the markets so spooked today.
Areas below the red line are when the yield curve has inverted. The shaded vertical bars indicate a recession. The parts where the blue line drops below the red line are always followed by a recession]
Despite the selloff, some market commentators still believe that a recession is still quite far-off and is unlikely to occur in the next 12 months. CNBC’s Jim Cramer, speaking on the business channel’s Squawk Box TV show this morning said that strong mortgage applications and legendary investor Warren Buffett’s faith in the banking sector — which investors are typically wary of when interest rates are low — means that this inversion may not be as significant as previous ones. “Longer term, am I going to bet against Buffett because the [algorithms] tell me to sell the stuff? I can’t. Particularly when the consumer’s taking advantage of the rates, and I look at the S&P top 50 companies, and it’s very hard to find ones that are really hurt by this,” Cramer said. 

A recession is typically described as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth and this hasn’t happened in the US since the first 2 quarters of 2009. With interest rates and the unemployment rate at historic lows, it is quite possible that the market’s fears are overblown and that there won’t be a recession to accompany this yield inversion. As of right now, it is clear, however, that investors aren’t taking any chances which is why there’s such a big selloff in stocks today.

256,"The Trade War: Outlook, Not So Good",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/foreign-policy/the-trade-war-outlook-not-so-good/,"Trade wars, like their nuclear counterparts, are essentially unwinnable. Once one side pulls the trigger the other side is left with no other option but to retaliate and mutually assured devastation ensues. 
And yet despite this, the world’s two biggest economies have now been engaged in a trade war for more than a year and there are no signs of it slowing down. In fact, with President Trump imposing new tariffs earlier this month and China retaliating by banning its state-owned companies from buying US agricultural goods, this trade war is actually heating up just as its impact is starting to drag down the economies of both countries. 

So how did we get here? There are many reasons why the Trump Administration pursued this trade war but it all mostly boils down to grievances over Intellectual Property (IP) theft, lack of fair access to Chinese markets and accusations of currency manipulation. Now the currency manipulation part is somewhat contentious and in fact, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) disagrees with the US on this charge. But pretty much everyone outside of China agrees that China should be doing a whole lot more within its borders to protect the IP of foreign companies and that it should also be making a much bigger effort at opening up its economy to foreign companies. 
There is overall bipartisan agreement that President Trump is correct in trying to do something about these discrepancies in market practices, however, there is disagreement over whether tariffs are the best means to apply pressure on China. The problem with tariffs is that they are a tax on goods coming into the US and importers usually pass on this tax to consumers by increasing the prices on the goods sold in America, which means that in the end, tariffs end up being a tax on the consumer.

President Trump and his advisers are aware of this “invisible tax” on consumers but they persist with it in the hope that the increasing price of Chinese goods will lead American consumers to switch to alternative (hopefully American made) products which would then hurt the Chinese economy. Of course, the Chinese can, and indeed already have, retaliated with tariffs on American products which are slowly but surely hurting the American economy, especially farmers in the Midwest.
In essence, the world’s foremost superpowers are now in a cowboy Western-style economic standoff waiting to see who will blink first and offer significant concessions in order to reverse the tariffs and end the trade war. 
So far no one has blinked which means that in all probability, tariffs will continue to escalate and the economies of both countries will get progressively worse over time until a resolution is found. And herein lies the problem for President Trump, because he is facing re-election next year with his favorable numbers mired in the low 40s while China is a one-party state whose leaders have no such concerns.
The economy has been the one consistent bright spot for a Trump Administration that has been otherwise mired in seemingly never-ending controversies and so any noticeable downturn in economic growth could be fatal for Trump’s re-election hopes.

Trump badly needs a “win” or at least some progress to show to voters in the fall of 2020, especially if the economy slows down like some experts expect it will. Goldman Sachs has already revised down its U.S. GDP expectations for 2019, while Bank of America has raised its expectations of a 2020 US recession to one in three. China’s economy is also expected to grow much slower than in recent years but again, Chinese leaders, with no elections to worry about, are under no immediate pressure to strike a deal and can at least temporarily ride this out until November 4th, 2020.
Trade wars are unwinnable but elections are. In the end, Trump will have to win the 2020 election in order to get the concessions he wants.

257,Sanders on Climate Change: Bigger Issue than ‘ISIS or al Qaeda’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/election/sanders-on-climate-change-bigger-issue-than-isis-or-al-qaeda/,"During the speech at the Iowa State Fair on August 11th, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told the crowd, “Four years ago I came here to Iowa and I was asked what is the major national security issue we face? And people thought I’d say ISIS or al Qaeda that those are big issues. The answer that I gave in terms of national security is climate change.”
Climate change is seen by many countries as the top international threat, followed by the ISIS, according to a 26-nation survey conducted in the spring of 2018.
According to the survey, however, people in the United States ranked cyberattacks as the number one most pressing international issue.

On his campaign page, Sanders also warns that “climate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet.”
If elected president, Sanders promises to pass the Green New Deal, a controversial proposal started by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that aims to move all energy production to sustainable methods. The proposal, according to Sanders, would, “protect workers and the communities in which they live to ensure a transition to family-sustaining wage, union jobs.”
The deal has been criticized as being a “radical front for nationalizing our economy,” by Ryan Bourne of the Cato Institute in USA Today, and, “an untrammeled Dear Santa letter without form, purpose, borders, or basis in reality,” by Charles Cooke in National Review.

258,The FBI Told Congress Domestic Terror Investigations Led to 90 Recent Arrests. It Wouldn’t Show Us Records of Even One.,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/the-fbi-told-congress-domestic-terror-investigations-led-to-90-recent-arrests-it-wouldnt-show-us-records-of-even-one/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
On July 23, FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Senate Judiciary Committee that federal investigations of domestic terrorism had led to some 100 arrests in the last nine months. While the FBI quickly announced that the number was 90, not 100, the basic message appeared unchanged: The FBI was actively investigating and prosecuting domestic terrorists.
The 90 arrests have been cited countless times since last weekend’s killing of 22 people in El Paso, Texas, by a man suspected of harboring racist views of immigrants. To find out more, we contacted the FBI on Monday, asking who had been arrested, as well as where and when, and what the allegations were in each case.
Four days later, we have been given next to no information about them.
Our first inquiry on Monday was straightforward: We asked for basic information about each of the 90 arrests, which we assumed had all been publicly announced.


An FBI spokeswoman wrote back: “We would not be able to provide you with a comprehensive list of these press releases. As there is no federal domestic terrorism statute so DT subjects are charged under other federal, state, and local charges.”
We understood that those arrested for committing or intending to commit violent acts on American soil are typically prosecuted for an assortment of crimes — murder, say, or illegal possession of firearms — not domestic terrorism, for which there’s no federal charge. The 90 people who were supposedly arrested might have been ultimately prosecuted by local authorities.
But it seemed clear from Wray’s statements that the FBI had done the work of determining which of the cases involving, as the spokeswoman put it, “other federal, state and local charges” involved elements of domestic terror. There had been a formal count. Wray had testified as much.
We wrote to the FBI again: “Thank you for getting back to me this fast and for your answer. I am a bit confused though: The number of DT arrests I was referring to originally comes from the FBI Director and was later clarified by a FBI spokesperson. So where would that number come from? I would be happy if you could clarify this point?”
The spokeswoman responded: “What do you mean? We clarified the number, it’s a comprehensive list of press releases that I’m saying we’re unable to provide.”
The spokeswoman, saying she was speaking “on background,” and thus not to be identified, later suggested that we go on the Department of Justice’s public affairs website and “see what pops up.”
So we did. When we typed in domestic terrorism arrests for the past nine months, five cases came up. But only one of the cases actually involved an American arrested for seeking to harm others in the U.S. — Cesar Sayoc, the man recently sentenced to 20 years for mailing 16 explosive devices to a variety of current and former government officials and the philanthropist George Soros.
Obviously, that was far short of the cases Wray had referenced. It also seemed odd that the FBI would suggest this approach to searching since it had to have done a more comprehensive compilation to equip its director with the numbers he gave the Senate Judiciary Committee.
We tried again: “Thanks for your reply! What I mean is: you clarified the number, so despite DT subjects being charged under ‘other federal, state, and local charges,’ as you wrote, the FBI obviously has information about all these cases. And this is what I’ve been originally asking for. So I would be glad if you could give me the following information about as many of the 90 arrests as possible: who was arrested, where, when and what the allegations were. If you are unable to provide this information or a comprehensive list of press releases I would like to know why.”
On the phone, she again cited the figure of 90 arrests, adding, “These are people that the FBI arrested as a result of a domestic terrorism investigation.”


But she also repeated that the bureau couldn’t give us any information, even press releases, about these arrests. “In their arrests they may not be characterized as domestic terrorists depending on how those arrests were made in the locality, in the state … so it’s just not something the FBI is able to publicly provide,” she said.
Yahoo News on Thursday published what it said was a document detailing the 2018 domestic terrorism arrests involving white supremacists, something the article said Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee had been unsuccessfully seeking from the Department of Justice.
“This map reflects 32 domestic terrorist attacks, disrupted plots, threats of violence, and weapons stockpiling by individuals with a radical political or social agenda who lack direction or influence from foreign terrorist organizations in 2018,” the document cited in the Yahoo article stated. The document, the article said, had been produced by New Jersey’s Office of Homeland Security Preparedness.
Late on Thursday, we tried to make things simpler with the FBI in hopes of getting some kind of firm answer: If the FBI could not quickly list the arrests stemming from domestic terrorism investigations, could it say how many such investigations had been carried out in 2019?
The spokeswoman did not respond to the request.
The entire exchange left us increasingly perplexed. The FBI had clearly been proud of its record in making arrests of possible domestic terrorists. Wray had testified that the bureau took the threat “extremely seriously.” The country was eager to be reassured in the aftermath of the killings in El Paso. Why wouldn’t the FBI be able to quickly cite its array of successes?
We asked the FBI if it could send us any of the press releases of the cases Wray had referenced specifically at the hearing. Once again, the spokeswoman demurred.

259,Biden on Tariffs: I Think It Will Cause a Lot of US Businesses to Go Bankrupt,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/biden-on-tariffs-i-think-it-will-cause-a-lot-of-us-businesses-to-go-bankrupt/,"Donald Trump’s increasing trade war with China will hurt US business more than it hurts the Chinese government, according to Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden.
Trump announced a 10-percent tariff on essentially all consumer goods imported from China on top of the existing 25-percent tariffs already on industrial gear. Those new tariffs will go into effect next month.
“So what does this mean? Every single thing that China sells to America will be taxed. Every toy, every piece of clothing, every bag of tea, every drop of oil, every pound of aluminum, every chemical, railcar, cell phone, electronics. Everything taxed. And you’ll pay it,” explained Fox News anchor Shepard Smith. “First the importers will pay it, then the distributors will pay it, then the stores will pay it, then they will pass it to you. The buck stops with you. You pay. That’s how this works. Always. It’s a new tax on things you buy and the president says it starts next month.

“And big picture: if you and everyone else is paying more for stuff, over time you will have to buy less of stuff, and that hurts the economy here and everywhere else. That’s what trade wars do,” Shepard added.
However, Biden said there are segments of the US economy–particularly in agriculture equipment– which will be very hard-hit.
“I think they are causing a lot more than little financial pain. I think it will cause a lot of people to go bankrupt,” said the former vice president, who is leading a field of some two dozen Democrats running for president. “I think it will cause an awful lot of ancillary industries like the industries that make tractors and all the farm equipment. They will be in real trouble.
“We are focusing on the wrong thing with China. I plan on and I’ve argued that we should be very tough with China,” Biden added. “China is stealing our intellectual property. China is stealing industries from us. And unless we, in fact, are able to unite the world in taking on China, they will set the rules of the road. They will be in the position. What we are doing now is going about it the wrong way. China is a problem. They are a security problem. They are a technology problem. They are investing more money, for example, in research and development then we are, because they are stealing an awful lot of our intellectual property.”

260,Congresswoman: Trump Needs to Stop ‘Gestapo’ Like ICE Raids,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/congresswoman-trump-needs-to-stop-gestapo-like-ice-raids/,"A senior Democrat on the House Judiciary and Homeland Security committees wants Donald Trump to stop the large-scale immigration raids he has ordered, such as the one this week in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents swept through businesses across Mississippi detaining nearly 700 undocumented immigrants.
Although more than 300 of those detained have already been released, MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell reported that alarming reports from USA Today that schoolteachers in Mississippi are concerned that parents won’t be home, that schoolchildren are going to be sent home from school to empty houses.

Mitchell asked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas what, if any, considerations were made for the children of those detained.
“Well, Andrea, just from the emotional standpoint, before I arrived at the studio, speaking to one of my Hispanic friends, happens to be a business person, I can’t capture for you the emotion of this individual with El Paso and all that is going on,” the congresswoman said, referring to the weekend mass shooting in El Paso where the shooter apparently had anti-immigrant motivation.
“What poor timing the president of the United States decides to take his very untoward and dastardly policies that are made to scare and intimidate not just those who are engaged in this roundup, but all across the nation,” Jackson Lee added. “Now let me be very clear. We understand land of immigrants and a land of laws. However, this process of raids have been used in the past and they are wrong-headed and ineffective. Every one of those persons has an address, were living in the community openly. Their children were going to school. And every one of them could have been appropriately rounded up in some other location. They were not escapees or felons, as President Obama focused on, people who would do harm to the United States. These are people who are working. And not only that, the wrongness, if you will, is on the business that didn’t process these people in the right manner. But I would say for the agricultural business, they’ve been begging for us to find ways for them to have workers in meat plants and other plants around the country. So, I am on Homeland Security.
“I think it’s unfortunate when I.C.E. has to be made into this kind of agency and to be an intimidator rather than an agency that has in the past made sure that we are safe in this nation. That is what Americans want, to be safe,” the congresswoman concluded. “But when their neighbors are rounded up in a vile way, when children are left unprotected, I’m disappointed. And the president and [presidential adviser] Steven Miller need to stop these gestapo tactics and we need to work together to pass comprehensive immigration reform.”

261,Proposed California Law Would Punish Companies for Failing to Limit Harm to the Planet’s Forests,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/proposed-california-law-would-punish-companies-for-failing-to-limit-harm-to-the-planets-forests/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
In an effort to cut carbon emissions and forestall the climate crisis, California legislators are pushing a new law aimed at helping limit deforestation around the globe.
The proposed bill, called the California Deforestation-Free Procurement Act, or AB 572, would require companies that contract with the state to certify that their products do not cause the cutting of sensitive tropical forests or the destruction of boggy peatland soils in tropical regions — both of which contain enormous stores of carbon dioxide.
The bill appears meant to add muscle to what are currently voluntary corporate pledges to limit environmental harm in the production of soy, cattle, rubber, timber and palm oil. It could mean new restrictions on everything from the paper used in California’s office printers, to the wooden conference tables furnishing those offices, to the food served in state cafeterias, which may contain palm oil grown on former forestlands.
“Hundreds of companies have made a rhetorical commitment to remove deforestation from their supply chains,” said Jeff Conant, senior international forests program manager for Friends of the Earth, an environmental organization that is backing the legislation. “But the only incentives for them to implement those commitments is market pressure or reputational risk.”
“This would be the first piece of legislation,” Conant said, “that puts that kind of commitment under the scrutiny of legislators.”
The bill’s backers assert that tropical forests cover 7% of the earth’s surface and are home to roughly half of the world’s species. Eighteen million acres of tropical forest are cut each year, the bill says, an act that both releases the carbon dioxide in the timber and ends the abilities of the trees to absorb additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a result, tropical deforestation is one of the largest global drivers of carbon emissions.


California’s proposed legislation follows an investigation last year by ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine into Indonesia’s role in producing palm oil on tropical forestlands and vulnerable peatland. That investigation found that some companies were illegally destroying protected forests there, leading to the release of more carbon in a year than all of Europe. The palm oil is used in food, but also for “green” biofuels once meant to serve as their own check on carbon emissions in Europe and the United States.
The bill’s author, San Jose assembly member Ash Kalra, also travelled to Brazil last year, where he witnessed a similar scope of forest destruction.
How such a bill would be enforced and exactly what it would mean for California remain open questions. In places like Indonesia, loopholes in regulations have allowed deforestation to continue despite laws banning it. California would not actively investigate compliance; it would instead rely on companies to self-certify that their supply chains are not contributing to tropical deforestation or peatland destruction.
But companies found to violate the commitment could see their contracts canceled and face fines — potentially even misdemeanor criminal charges — according to Kalra’s office. The bill would require the state’s Department of General Services to develop a set of formal guidelines for compliance, including a list of commodities that present a potential risk to forests.
“Unlike most corporate policies, the fact that this one includes real penalties for fake commitments gives it teeth,” said Glenn Hurowitz, chief executive of the anti-deforestation group Mighty Earth.


California — home to the world’s fifth-largest economy — plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, making it one of the most ambitious leaders in addressing the global climate crisis. No analysis has been done to quantify the carbon footprint associated with the state’s procurement contracts, and the proposed legislation would not be accounted for in terms of the state’s measure of total emissions, according to Conant.
But by leveraging its enormous purchasing power toward goals that are understood to dramatically reduce emissions, advocates say they believe California would be taking a significant step toward a carbon-minimized future.
In addition to Friends of the Earth, the bill is also sponsored by two animal rights groups, Peace 4 Animals and Social Compassion in Legislation. The bill will progress to a final Senate committee hearing Aug. 19 and a vote before the full Assembly by Sept. 13. If it passes, it will head to the desk of Gov. Gavin Newsom.

262,Poll: Ocasio-Cortez More Popular After Trump’s Attacks,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/poll-ocasio-cortez-more-popular-after-trumps-attacks/,"Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York was one of the non-white Democratic congresswomen who was forced to weather a recent racist attack from Donald Trump.
Despite such political abuse (or perhaps because of it), a funny thing happened: Ocasio-Cortez’s popularity only has risen.

Her favorability among New Yorkers grew 10 points, up to 41 percent while her unfavorable rating fell 3 points, also to land at 41 percent. The numbers are from a Siena College poll.
“New York voters give AOC her highest favoritability rating yet,” MSNBC morning co-host Mika Brzezinski said, using a common nickname for Ocasio-Cortez. “Those new poll numbers make Ocasio-Cortez more popular than President Trump in their shared home state of New York,” Brzezinski added.
“You know, the more he attacks people, the more their numbers go up,” interjected co-host Willie Geist.
“When he goes after Morning Joe, that’s been the case,” Geist added, referring to the name of the MSNBC morning program. “When he goes after you guys, that’s been the case. And when he makes a boogie man out of AOC that’s the case.”

263,"Trump Losing His Base, Poll Finds",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trump-losing-his-base-poll-finds/,"Although Donald Trump has the approval of 85 percent or more of Republicans, but that is not the same as enthusiasm–and on that Democrats have a big gap: a stunning 85 percent strongly disapprove; while 67 percent of Republicans strongly approve (and only 37 percent of moderates), according to pollsters with the Democratic-associated non-profit, Democracy Corps.
That is an 18 point enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans (and we know from 2018, it was the less enthusiastic Republicans who did not vote or shifted to the Democrats), the Democracy Corps pollsters said.

This kind of gap translated into a blue wave in 2018 and another is building for 2020, they added.
The poll also confirms the pull back of white working class women too. Trump wins these voters by 8 points against Biden and 10 against Warren, comparable to the margin among these white working class women in 2018 when Democrats made gains and very different from the 27-point Trump margin in 2016.

264,Iran Has Hundreds of Naval Mines. U.S. Navy Minesweepers Find Old Dishwashers and Car Parts.,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/iran-has-hundreds-of-naval-mines-u-s-navy-minesweepers-find-old-dishwashers-and-car-parts/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
The U.S. Navy officer was eager to talk.
He’d seen his ship, one of the Navy’s fleet of 11 minesweepers, sidelined by repairs and maintenance for more than 20 months. Once the ship, based in Japan, returned to action, its crew was only able to conduct its most essential training — how to identify and defuse underwater mines — for fewer than 10 days the entire next year. During those training missions, the officer said, the crew found it hard to trust the ship’s faulty navigation system: It ran on Windows 2000.
The officer, hoping that by speaking out he could provoke needed change, wound up delaying the scheduled interview. He apologized. His ship had broken down again.
“We are essentially the ships that the Navy forgot,” he said of the minesweepers.
Thousands of miles away in the Persian Gulf, another officer, this one assigned to a minesweeper in the Navy’s 5th Fleet, offered much the same account. While tensions with Iran seem to escalate by the day, the officer said the four minesweepers based in the Gulf were so physically unreliable that he doubted his superiors would actually send them into action in a crisis.
The ships are one of the Navy’s primary tools for finding and neutralizing mines. They use sonar to hunt for them. The bombs are then disabled by divers, underwater drones or towing equipment dragged behind the stern.
But the aging minesweepers routinely need repairs, the officer in the Persian Gulf said, and the companies that used to make a variety of spare parts no longer exist. A sailor recently aboard one ship said the sonar meant to detect mines was so imprecise that in training exercises it flagged dishwashers, crab traps and cars on the ocean floor as potential bombs.
Clearing mines from the Persian Gulf effectively would require multiple ships underway for a sustained period. A Navy spokesman acknowledged that the service has struggled to put a “fully mission-capable” squad to sea. Only a quarter of the time over the last year did more than one ship meet that definition — although he said the ships could still be sent out.


“We are eager to operate if called upon,” the officer aboard one of the Persian Gulf ships said. “We’ll operate the systems as best as they can operate. My concern is the ships are old and, like any old ship, they break.”
The Avenger-class ships were built in the late 1980s and early ’90s and slated for retirement years ago. But their retirement date has been continually delayed because the service still doesn’t have a working replacement. The Navy’s latest estimate is that the ships will all be decommissioned by fiscal year 2023.
Senior Navy officials have called their mine warfare fleet in the Persian Gulf — a mix of aging ships, high-tech drones and helicopters — “the best and the brightest around,” and a Navy spokesman recently said the minesweeper fleet was “fully capable” of fulfilling its mission of finding and neutralizing mines. The Navy’s underwater drones, the spokesman said, “have a high rate of success,” and the sonar systems on the ships “are very accurate at detecting mines.”
While the spokesman conceded “there are challenges with all older ships, including maintenance and repair” that might make it take longer for the ships to accomplish their mission, he said maintenance problems have “dramatically improved” of late. He noted that as recently as July 6, all four of the older minesweepers based in the Persian Gulf had been at sea at the same time. (An officer aboard one of the ships called it a “photo exercise” and said it was “extraordinarily rare” to see all four out at once.)
ProPublica has spent this year examining the Navy’s state of readiness, including its response to known vulnerabilities in its ranks and arsenal. As part of that effort, ProPublica spoke with a dozen Navy officers, sailors, contractors and experts about the mine warfare unit. Those interviewed asked for anonymity so they could candidly discuss what they allege is neglect in the unit. The weakness they describe is in a relatively modest and unglamorous division of the Navy — 11 ships with a limited mission — but they nonetheless feel the problems have become more pressing given the United States’ volatile relationships with Iran and North Korea.
Those interviewed said Navy brass had made damaging budget decisions that have kept them from having a well-functioning mine warfare fleet.
“It’s not that they don’t want it, it’s that they want other things more,” one officer said. “Every dollar you’re spending on [mine countermeasures] is a dollar you’re not spending on some cool new submarine.”
To make matters worse, efforts to replace the aging ships with newer ones have met with repeated costly delays. And the quality of the training given to the sailors in the unit had suffered.
A defense contractor who has worked with the ships in recent years said the minesweepers suffered the highest rate of mechanical problems of any Navy ship. (A Navy spokesman declined to comment on that assessment, but he said that “recent metrics show that there has been substantial improvement.”) The USS Devastator, or MCM 6, was recently out of commission because the Navy couldn’t fix a key part, according to a sailor who recently served a long tour on the ship. The ship was out of the water so long the sailors started jokingly referring to it as “Building 6,” since it never actually moved.


Another military contractor who has worked with the minesweepers said the Navy has historically relied too heavily on computer-based training instead of hands-on exercises. Sailors on the ships, he said, often do not know how to use their equipment.
“I’m telling you they can’t do it, not with any degree of operational proficiency,” the contractor said.
The Navy built its first modern minesweeper during the 1940s. The fleet proved critical during World War II for clearing heavily mined waters in the Pacific for warships to pass and ahead of large amphibious assaults, such as the war-defining Battle of Okinawa. Some of those ships were then recommissioned to do the same job during the Korean War after hundreds of Soviet-made mines were dropped by the North Koreans.
Decades later, the Korea-era ships were part of an international effort led by the British in the Persian Gulf to try to keep the shipping lanes safe during the mining campaigns of the Iran-Iraq War. And then again in 1991, those old minesweepers, along with the first commissioned Avenger ship, were in the same waters struggling to clear a path for U.S. warships to approach the coast of Kuwait during the Persian Gulf War. Two U.S. vessels had been damaged by mines. After the war ended, the minesweeper units trolled the waters off Kuwait to find and disarm the more than 1,000 mines Iraq had dropped in concentric arcs for miles.
As the rest of the new class of minesweepers were commissioned, they deployed to the region and became a regular fixture there. The Avenger-class ships were called into service during the 2003 invasion of Iraq to stand ready for any mining near an Iraqi port that would be key for getting supplies and humanitarian aid into the country during the war.
Iran, which is also believed to have thousands of naval mines, has stepped up its aggressiveness in the Persian Gulf in recent weeks.
The mines are dropped into the sea and explode when ships pass. Iran’s arsenal includes a mix of cheaper, older ones that float and blow up on impact, and more sophisticated ones that can be dropped from planes. They sit on the ocean floor and explode after detecting nearby ships.
“We certainly have the ability to do it,” Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said last month about closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical commercial passageway. “But we certainly don’t want to do it because the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf are our lifeline.”
Sailors in the 5th Fleet’s minesweeping operations said they have watched the escalation of hostility in the Persian Gulf — the downing of drones by Iran and the U.S., masked gunmen rappelling from an Iranian helicopter to seize a British-flagged oil tanker — with a mix of excitement and pessimism. They are eager to contribute but doubt their ability to do so.
Asked if the ships could effectively find and remove mines in the Gulf if they had to, one officer was blunt: “No.”
The Bahrain-based minesweepers, more than two times the length of a basketball court, are made of wood so they can more safely approach magnetic naval mines. Sailors have to be cautious about bringing anything made of metal on board, mindful even of where they store canned foods.
Like all ships deployed abroad, the minesweepers operate on a cycle: a planned ship maintenance phase, followed by basic training when the crew practices finding and disarming dummy mines, and finally underway periods, which include shows of force and joint exercises with allied navies. Those interviewed said the four ships do receive all of their allotted maintenance time, but the ships frequently require their crews to cannibalize working parts from other minesweepers — a challenge considering how few of them there are — or wait for new replacements.
“It takes a long time,” one officer said. “Many, many months.”
As a result, the officer said each of the four ships are typically underway only 15% of the time. Sometimes, those interviewed said, the training missions that get done prove as frustrating as being stuck in drydock. The sailor who’d been on the Devastator said the underwater drones are successful in finding mines only about 20% of the time. He knew of only one time when the crew was able to find a mine, and that was during a training exercise when it had the GPS coordinates for it.
“We joke about it all the time,” said the officer who is based in Japan. “It seems like somebody’s doing a social experiment. They take 80 or 90 well-intentioned, talented or motivated people and put us on ship with broken and unreliable equipment and give them an impossible task and see how they handle it mentally and emotionally.”
That there are problems with the mine warfare unit is well known to the Navy.
The Navy’s former top officer, Adm. Jonathan Greenert, told ProPublica that when he took command in 2011, he was immediately notified of the deteriorating mine warfare units in the Persian Gulf by the combatant commander in the Middle East at the time, Gen. Jim Mattis.


Greenert said he responded by putting more of an emphasis on the use of newly developed unmanned vehicles that could be dispatched to find and detonate mines. And he ramped up mine-clearing exercises with other navies, including those of the British and Gulf states.
The effort didn’t resolve some of the unit’s issues, however.
In 2013, the USS Guardian, a minesweeper, accidentally ran into a sensitive coral reef in the Philippines. No one was injured, but the $212 million ship had to be decommissioned, and the U.S. ambassador was forced to apologize for the damage to the World Heritage site.
Three years later, the Navy’s Sea Dragon helicopters, which stream cables that dislodge mines moored to the ocean floor, came under damning scrutiny. In a lengthy examination in The Virginian-Pilot, the Sea Dragons were found to have been used long after they were supposed to be retired. Over a three-year period, they had crashed at a higher rate than any other military aircraft, including a 2014 crash that killed three service members.
The Navy’s plan to replace the minesweepers with a new class of vessels, known as Littoral Combat Ships, has been repeatedly delayed by cost overruns and technical deficiencies. The push to develop the new line of ships has been a financial drain on the minesweeping budget and the maintenance of the existing fleet.


Congress, concerned about resources being diverted, has required the Navy not to decommission the ships or reduce how many sailors are assigned to them until there’s a replacement that would “meet or exceed” their capabilities. The Navy, in the shipbuilding plan it submitted to Congress this year, said that in the next year it would begin retiring three of its 11 minesweepers — the ones based in the U.S., in San Diego — and harvest their parts to service the eight ships based in Japan and Bahrain.
An officer briefed on the planning said top Navy officials were reluctant to pump more money into maintaining the older minesweepers and were taking a gamble that the new ships would finally be ready just as the legacy minesweepers were decommissioned.
“We’d be extremely lucky if those lined up,” the officer said. “There has been a conscious decision by Navy leadership to assume risk in the present.”
Asked whether the Navy was taking a risk assuming the new line of ships would be ready to take over before the Avengers were decommissioned, the Navy’s spokesman would only say that the Navy is constantly reviewing its capacity for the mission.
In the Persian Gulf now, one officer described the difficulties of instilling a sense of urgency and mission in sailors who doubt the senior ranks of the Navy will ever trust their prowess if Iran were to deploy mines.
“I have to tell them, ‘We always have to be ready,’” the officer said. “But it is tough to put your people through very hard conditions when you privately think you’re not going to go out.”

265,‘As Bad as This May Sound…’: MSNBC’s Ruhle Wonders If Beto O’Rourke Will Benefit from Post-Shooting Media Blitz,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/as-bad-as-this-may-sound-msnbcs-ruhle-wonders-if-beto-orourke-will-benefit-from-post-shooting-media-blitz/,"A MSNBC midday host mused on-air whether former congressman Beto O’Rourke would see a bump in his polls as a result of the media blitz he’s experienced in recent days as a result of Saturday’s mass shooting in O’Rourke’s native El Paso, Texas.
O’Rourke, who became a national political star last year for nearly defeating GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, has largely struggled more recently as one of the two dozen Democrats running for president.
A gunman opened fire at an El Paso Walmart store, killing 22 and injuring 24 others. The attacker posted online a racist screed mimicking much of Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. That mass murder was followed hours later by a second, apparently unrelated mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio.
Since then, O’Rourke has been a fixture on TV coverage of the tragedy, including being outspoken in telling Trump not to visit El Paso in response to the murders.

MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle asked whether, perversely, the attention over the shooting could boost O’Rourke’s profile.
“Maria, Beto has said he is running in the name of decency and democracy. As bad as this may sound, could this moment be a chance for Beto to gain some momentum?” Ruhle queried.
Maria Theresa Kumar, a political activist and head of the Latino political organization Voto Latino, replied, “I think so. I mean, when you look at who the president is most afraid of, you often hear within inner circles that Beto is the one that concerns him. And it’s not only because he was able to capture the imagination of progressive Texas, he got over 500,000 Republicans to vote for him and he got a lot of independents to vote for him. Let’s not forget Obama lost Texas by 16 points, four years later Hillary lost 9 and two years later Beto lost by a merely two.
“And it’s significant because right now Arizona just went purple. That’s 11 electoral votes. Texas has 38 electoral votes,” Kumar added.

266,"West Virginia Bets Big on Plastics, and on Backing of Trump Administration",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/west-virginia-bets-big-on-plastics-and-on-backing-of-trump-administration/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

West Virginia’s industrial might has faded, but as 2020 approaches, the state has two resources that could be crucial to President Donald Trump as he seeks reelection and tries to make good on his pledge of “American energy dominance” — Republican votes and abundant natural gas.
It was a stretch of rural counties along the Ohio River in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania that form the largest natural gas field in the world and helped Trump win the states in 2016.
West Virginia’s elected leaders see the vast reserves as a path to renewed political and economic relevance for the Mountain State, which they envision rivaling the Gulf Coast as a center for processing natural gas and producing plastics.
And to make that a reality, the state’s top officials have lined up behind a plan to spend as much as $10 billion to build a mammoth underground storage facility — big enough to hold the U.S. Capitol complex, or 10 million barrels of the liquid byproducts used in plastics manufacturing.
By providing a sizable and stable storehouse for ethane and other so-called gas liquids, the facility would, its proponents say, encourage the expansion of a chemical production corridor that is emerging along the upper Ohio River and would help bring thousands of jobs to a region that has seen its industrial moorings slip away over the past two generations.


The prospect of an energy jobs bonanza in a politically vital state stirred the interest of the White House. A senior Energy Department manager has been assigned to work on the project, known as the Appalachian Storage and Trading Hub. In April, the president issued an executive order on energy that encouraged “opportunities, through the federal government or otherwise, to promote economic growth of the Appalachian region, including growth of petrochemical and other industries.” And the president’s newest budget proposal includes funds to study the region’s gas-related industrial potential.
But a ProPublica examination has found that the proposed storage facility would be far larger than the region could support and that questions about its cost, its viability and its environmental risks have been overshadowed by a public relations strategy heavy on the politics of jobs and light on the economics of energy policy.
“The scale of the Appalachian hub is out of line with what industry needs or will require in the region,” said Michael Tritt, president of Lane Power and Energy Solutions, a Houston-based construction company that designs and builds energy storage caverns.
The Trump administration’s relations with China and Russia are adding to the questions about the hub. China had agreed to invest tens of billions of dollars in West Virginia’s natural gas industry but now is embroiled in a trade war with Trump. And American Ethane, a Houston-based company financed by three Russian businessmen, has signed 20-year contracts to send ethane produced in the United States to China, which could raise prices and weaken demand for the facility proposed for West Virginia.
Far from being dissuaded, state leaders, led by Sen. Joe Manchin III, are pressing forward, talking up the project and perhaps most significantly trying to secure a $1.9 billion federal loan guarantee that could attract billions of dollars in private investment.


If the hub’s developers succeed, taxpayers could be on the hook for a big piece of any failure. The federal loan guarantee sought for the hub is nearly four times as large as a guarantee awarded more than a decade ago to Solyndra, the California solar firm that collapsed in 2011. “This whole project is a gamble,” said Dustin White, project coordinator with the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, an environmental group in Huntington, West Virginia. “Billions of dollars could go up in smoke. We just need to stop it now.”
Banks, though, would be in line for tens of millions of dollars in finance fees. “If that project gets a federal loan guarantee, banks will be lining up 10 deep,” said James Cutler, an energy industry investor and veteran chemical plant builder from Houston. “Anybody who gets involved gets 1.5 to 2% in fees just for getting the deals together. If you have a $4 billion, $5 billion project, that’s $80 million, $100 million.”
Other big winners could be Manchin, a Democrat, and Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican. The energy, construction and labor sectors contributed $841,591 to Manchin’s 2018 election campaign. Energy, finance, construction and labor contributed $169,600 to Justice’s 2016 campaign, according to Vote Smart, which tracks election campaign financing.
In an interview, Manchin said that he is looking to Energy Secretary Rick Perry for help in “streamlining” the loan review and that he is urging the Treasury Department to invoke national security concerns to halt American Ethane’s export plans.
John Houghtaling, the chief executive of American Ethane, said Manchin is wrong. “The national security threat is not exporting ethane to China,” Houghtaling said in an interview. “They need the gas. If they don’t get it from us they’ll get it from Russia and Qatar, people who don’t like us so much.”
Manchin, the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the federal government has to intervene. If it doesn’t step in, the project is doomed, he said. “You can write off the storage hub for sure. You can write off everything.”
From its start where two tributaries meet at a wedge of parkland in Pittsburgh, the Ohio River surges north, then south, then west past high banks that have been the stage of every era of American industrial development. Thousands of feet below the river are thick layers of salt and seams of shale and hard rock that encompass eons of geological evolution.
Few regions of the country have been endowed with such a rich repository of water, land and minerals, or have seen natural resources so grossly mismanaged, than the three states and 50 counties along the first 180 miles of the Ohio. Forests fell to the mills that provided the first burst of manufacturing wealth in the 18th century and that produced gaping tracts that poured great gouts of mud into the river.
The nation’s first petrochemical complex emerged in the 1920s along the Kanawha River in Charleston, West Virginia, to tap salt caverns for brine to make chlorine. The air and water discharges from the plants sickened people and poisoned the river, an Ohio tributary.
Coal from mines in the three states fueled a vast metals manufacturing sector in the mid-20th century and generated wages and prosperity never seen before. When the mills shut down near the century’s end, they left miles of toxic contamination and a trail of industrial desolation.
In the late 20th century, state officials approved new strip mining practices that allowed companies to blast away at the summits of West Virginia mountains to gain easier access to coal seams. So-called mountaintop removal mining buried streams with rubble, pushed towns aside and, because of increased production efficiencies, accelerated the drain of coal mining jobs.
Brian Anderson, a chemical engineer who is a West Virginia native and grandson of a coal miner, understands this frustrating history. In 2006, he joined West Virginia University’s faculty.


It was a striking year in the history of American energy development. New technology was starting to transform the oil and gas industry by giving developers the capacity to tap deep shale reserves around the country that were long known to contain gas and oil but were impractical to develop.
Two of those fuel-soaked shale formations, the Marcellus and the Utica, lie deep below the upper Ohio region. Directional drilling allowed developers to reach the shale, then turn the drill bit axis from perpendicular to longitudinal and lay pipes for a mile, sometimes two, through the thick shale seams. Hydraulic fracturing gave developers the capacity to pump, under ultrahigh pressure, millions of gallons of water mixed with chemicals and sand into wells to fracture the rock so that oil and gas would flow out.
The new production techniques solved the challenge that had bedeviled presidents from Richard Nixon to George W. Bush to make America “energy independent.” Because of directional drilling and hydrofracking, the U.S. is pumping a record 12 million barrels of oil a day, more than twice the production from a decade ago, and producing 38 trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually, more than any other country.
The wells are also yielding vast amounts of gas liquids, especially ethane, the basic feedstock for producing ethylene and polyethylene, which are used to manufacture plastic.
In Morgantown, Anderson was emerging as one of the university’s young stars, in large part because he had big ideas about the state’s energy reserves and its economy. He began talking about a hub mined from deep geologic salt or rock formations that would be capable of storing millions of barrels of natural gas liquids.


The concept has a working model in Mont Belvieu, Texas, where a hub that is capable of storing 240 million barrels of gas liquids in deep salt caverns has operated for nearly 70 years and is an important factor in the Gulf Coast’s development as the nation’s center of chemical manufacturing.
Anderson argued that such a hub would be the essential ingredient in a formula that West Virginia consistently failed to get right: how to generate durable prosperity and good jobs from an abundant homegrown resource — with, he insisted, scant harm to the environment. Without the hub, Anderson said, West Virginia would end up producing the raw materials to generate another state’s prosperity.
In 2014, Anderson established the West Virginia University Energy Institute, which he positioned as a platform to advance the hub idea.
The following year, the governors of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia formed the Tri-State Shale Coalition to pursue chemical manufacturing along the upper Ohio. The Appalachian Storage Hub was among the coalition’s top priorities.
It wasn’t until 2016, though, that the hub idea drew serious attention in Washington. That June, Shell announced it would build a plant in Monaca, Pennsylvania, 30 miles downriver from Pittsburgh, to convert 105,000 barrels of ethane a day to polyethylene for plastics manufacturing. The Energy Institute quickly assembled a team of geologists to study suitable deep salt and rock formations to build the storage hub.
Anderson and other leaders of West Virginia University opened negotiations with the Mid-Atlantic Technology, Research and Innovation Center, a nonprofit research firm in Charleston, to form the Appalachia Development Group, a partnership to develop the hub.
At a field hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, held in Morgantown in August 2016, Anderson testified that “developing storage and transportation infrastructure is a critical pathway to developing the industry in the region.”
That November, Trump was elected. West Virginia’s two senators, Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, and Justice began opening pathways to secure the administration’s support.
With funding from Congress, the Energy Department launched a study of the feasibility of establishing an ethane storage and distribution hub in the upper Ohio region. Perry told a House committee the hub would do more than serve the region’s economic interests.
Citing damage from Hurricane Harvey, which disrupted the Gulf Coast chemical industry in 2017, Perry said that establishing another petrochemical hub outside vulnerable Louisiana and Texas “is a national security issue.”
“To develop that in another region of this country, the Appalachian basin, makes sense because you’re sitting on top of Marcellus and Utica, which are prolific gas fields,” Perry told the committee during the March 2018 hearing.
In November 2018, Perry appointed Anderson director of the National Energy Technology Laboratory, the federal government’s leading fossil energy research center. The following month, Perry’s department released its Appalachian hub study. The authors found that the hub “could provide benefits to the broader petrochemical and plastics industries” because ethane production in the upper Ohio region would increase to 640,000 barrels a day by 2025, about a third of expected national production, and almost triple the ethane production in 2017.
Manchin, meanwhile, guided the Appalachia Development Group to the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, which encourages innovative clean-energy technology by guaranteeing loans to develop and implement such projects.


The Appalachian Development Group is seeking a $1.9 billion guarantee, one of the largest ever considered by the federal government. Armed with favorable studies from the Energy Institute and American Chemistry Council, the Appalachian group cleared the first round of the application. But the next round presents a much bigger test.
Applicants are required to meet hundreds of specific design, planning, engineering, construction, environmental and finance criteria. The process typically takes years and costs tens of millions of dollars.
The Appalachian group also needs to sign contracts with companies that would use the hub, and it must raise roughly $1.4 billion more in private capital to satisfy the loan office’s financing requirements. Joe Bozada, the Appalachia Development Group’s chief financial officer, declined to discuss the group’s fundraising effort.
The most expensive project backed by the Loan Programs Office is $12 billion in guarantees for a new nuclear plant in Georgia that is three years overdue and projected to cost almost $30 billion — more than twice the initial price tag. And its most prominent loss was the $535 million guarantee, awarded in 2009, to finance the development of new electricity-generating panels manufactured by Solyndra, which collapsed two years later.
With its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the Loan Programs Office has rarely been a source of federal financing for fossil energy projects, such as the hub.
Some engineers who work in the industry say that the Appalachia hub does not appear to meet two basic criteria for the clean energy loan guarantee. It is not a one-of-a-kind project, nor is it especially innovative, the engineers say. Gas liquids storage hubs are common along the Gulf Coast, and another big one operates in Conway, Kansas.
“There’s nothing new about building and operating liquids storage caverns. They operate all over the country,” said Tritt, of Lane Power and Energy Solutions.
Steve Hedrick, the chief executive of the Appalachia Development Group, declined requests for an interview. Brian Mahar, an Energy Department spokesman, said his agency does not comment on loan applicants or applications.
The questions facing the Appalachian hub’s developer and government supporters underscore the financial and political challenges of such a vast undertaking.
Megaprojects typically take decades to design, finance and build. In this century, new refineries, big dams, huge mines and oil and gas pipelines come online under much different market and environmental conditions than when they were conceived. Some encounter ecological turmoil — floods, storms, earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires — and political turbulence so severe that they don’t get started, are seriously delayed or fail midway through construction. The $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline to transport oil from Canada to Kansas is years overdue and facing significant public resistance along its route across the Great Plains. The cost and difficulty of building the nuclear Plant Vogtle in Georgia is increasing so much that its completion is in doubt.
Such pressure can fracture alliances crucial to development. Last year, West Virginia University and the state government broke with Hedrick and the Appalachia Development Group.
James Wood, interim director of the Energy Institute, who took over after Anderson’s departure, said the university and Hedrick were to share the corporate leadership and management of Appalachia Development Group. But when Hedrick filed the incorporation papers in Delaware in July 2017, he named himself the chief executive and did not list any university official as an officer. The incorporation papers said the Mid-Atlantic Technology, Research and Innovation Center, known as MATRIC, was the company’s sole owner and would be controlled by Hedrick, its chief executive.
“I was shocked when I learned that,” said Wood.
West Virginia University had hired a consultant to prepare documents for the Part I application and had paid the filing fee. After the Part I application was filed with the Energy Department, Hedrick did not reimburse the university, Wood said.


The falling out with the governor occurred after Hedrick joined the West Virginia trade delegation that traveled to Beijing in 2017 to participate in the signing ceremony for a $83.7 billion memorandum of understanding between China Energy and the state. Hedrick spent another day in China meeting with companies to raise $100 million to help finance the hub. The governor publicly criticized Hedrick for promoting his company on a state-sponsored trip and required him to reimburse the state for $23,000 in travel expenses.
And the deal between American Ethane and China could affect the storage hub’s prospects. Houghtaling, the company’s chief executive, said the agreements call for supplying 350,000 barrels of ethane a day to Chinese chemical makers from a new terminal in Beaumont, Texas. But the export contracts and the terminal are on hold because of the U.S.-China trade war.
Manchin said he is taking his protest of the export agreements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, an interagency group overseen by the Department of Treasury and charged with reviewing transactions involving foreign investment that could affect national security. A Treasury spokesman said the department does not comment on specific CFIUS cases.
The uncertainty and turmoil has consequences for the upper Ohio River chemical industry and the storage hub. PTT Global, a Thai-South Korean consortium, has delayed for more than a year its decision to build a $10 billion chemical plant along the river in Shadyside, Ohio.
Managers for Royal Dutch Shell, which is constructing a $10 billion chemical plant downriver from Pittsburgh, said in an interview that they had no interest in gas liquids storage or the federally financed hub.
Industrial Info Resources, a Houston consulting firm that tracks construction projects around the world, said it has identified three other abandoned proposals for ethane processing plants along the upper Ohio.
“It’s a difficult place to build a plant and to operate,” said James Cutler, the chemical plant builder from Houston who proposed two of the plants. “You have to make a lot of assumptions about the gas market, the plastics market, production and supply. There’s considerable risk that investors aren’t willing to take.”
And the need is uncertain, he said. “Do you need ethane storage to build a world-scale plant? The answer is no. Does it help? It could.”
Two companies — Energy Storage Ventures, a Colorado-based company backed by Goldman Sachs, and Marathon Pipeline, a unit of Marathon Oil — are cautiously examining the potential to establish much smaller, privately financed gas liquids storage facilities across the river in Ohio. “We’d like to believe there is local demand for 2 million to 3 million barrels of storage in the Appalachian region,” said David Hooker, president of Energy Storage Ventures. “We question the need for 10-plus million barrels based on what exists today or the foreseeable future.”
“There are going to be two or three storage locations that support development and pipeline operations in that region. They all will be smaller and done by the private sector,” Tritt added. “It takes years to get through that federal loan guarantee process. By then the private locations will be started. I don’t see any reason for the government to be involved. I don’t see a role for the government in this.”

267,"Voters Highly Politically Attuned, Support Immigrants, Survey Finds",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/voters-highly-politically-attuned-support-immigrants-survey-finds/,"Voters are following politics in ways not witnessed before — three quarters at the highest level on a 0 to 10 ladder scale, down 2 points from the government shutdown but that was higher than any point in Democracy Corps polling in a presidential year and the first time, engagement grew higher after a major election, according to the results of the Washington DC non-profit organization’s July national phone survey.
The percentage saying immigrants strengthen the country, are not a burden, has risen from 54 percent after the election to 65 percent now, 52 percent strongly. Only 26 percent agree with Donald Trump that they are a burden because they take jobs, housing, and health care, according to the results.

Former vice president Joe Biden has an 8 point lead over Trump (close to the 2018 Democratic margin), while Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now at 6 points, slightly larger than President Barack Obama’s 2008 margin. Again, both would gain if the Libertarian candidate plays less of a role, according to the Democracy Corps analysis of its results.
Right now, he is benefited by support for impeachment, but his Tea Party history and philosophy may pull those voters away.
Biden is running as the more mainstream and moderate candidate, and he less successfully consolidates Democrats (86 percent versus 90 percent for Warren). But Biden wins independents by 10 points, while Warren wins them by only 5. Biden picks up 7 percent of Republicans, while Warren gets 5.
This phone survey of 1,700 registered voters — 1,000 sample of registered voters and over-sample of 700 Republicans — was completed between July 18 to 28, before the second wave of presidential debates and before the week of mass shootings. 
For practical reasons, Democracy Corps tested two presidential candidates, Biden and Warren, because they defined the ideological range of the current field. They tested as well the the messages advanced by the major candidates in the debates, including Biden, Warren, Sens. Kamala Harris, and Bernie Sanders, as well as the libertarian, independent Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan.

268,How Trump’s Political Appointees Overruled Tougher Settlements With Big Banks,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/how-trumps-political-appointees-overruled-tougher-settlements-with-big-banks/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
Since Donald Trump’s election, federal white-collar enforcement has taken a big hit. Fines and settlements against corporations have plummeted. Prosecutions of individuals are falling to record lows.
But just how these fines and settlements came to be slashed is less well understood. Two settlements with giant banks over financial crisis-era misdeeds provide a window into how the Trump administration has eased up on corporate wrongdoers.
In settlements last year with the two big U.K.-based banks, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, political appointees at the Trump administration Justice Department took the unusual step of overruling staff prosecutors to reduce the settlements sought, leaving billions of dollars in potential recoveries on the table, according to four people familiar with the settlements.


In the case of RBS, then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided that the charges should not be pursued as a criminal case, as the prosecutorial team advocated, but rather as a less serious civil one.
Both cases were developed by the Obama administration DOJ and involved accusations that the banks misled buyers of residential mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. Prosecutors seemingly found numerous examples of bankers knowingly selling lemons to their customers. The mortgages they were putting into securities were “total fucking garbage,” one RBS executive said in a phone call that was recorded and cited in a DOJ filing. A Barclays banker said a group of loans “scares the shit out of me.” Mortgages that went into the two banks’ securities lost a total of $73 billion, according to calculations used by the government.
In March 2018, the DOJ settled with Barclays for $2 billion, a sum dictated by Trump appointees that was far below what the staff prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn had sought. The settlement with RBS occurred in August 2018, for $4.9 billion. After Rosenstein downgraded the case from criminal to civil, other Trump appointees concluded that the settlement amount should be about half of what staff prosecutors in the District of Massachusetts had sought.
DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Sutton said that the Barclays and RBS settlements held the banks accountable for serious misconduct, and that the penalties recovered from the banks were fair and proportionate compared with those previously obtained from other banks. She did not respond to detailed questions about how the two settlements were reached and why key decisions were dictated from Washington. “They were largely negotiated by career attorneys in the Department and U.S. Attorneys’ offices with the support and collaboration of Department leadership,” Sutton wrote in an email.
Aspects of how the DOJ came to settle the cases have been recounted. The New York Times reported on Rosenstein’s decision in the RBS case. But this is the first extensive account of how the banks secured the favorable outcomes.
The British banks employed an old playbook, one that proved effective with the Trump administration: Hire prominent former high-level DOJ officials who were now at major law firms. These attorneys won access to the top echelons of the Trump DOJ, where they found an audience receptive to their arguments that the staff prosecutors were unfairly singling out their clients for excess punishment.
The two cases stemmed from the Obama administration’s efforts to bring charges against banks for misdeeds that contributed to the financial crisis. Critics assailed the Obama DOJ for what they perceived as tardy and inadequate policing of financial crisis malfeasance. For example, the Obama DOJ did not prosecute any top bankers for actions related to the crisis. But it did belatedly bring civil charges, and it reached large settlements with numerous banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America. Moreover, the Obama-era DOJ consistently required the banks to acknowledge their bad acts, a practice that has ceased during the Trump administration.


As the Obama administration was winding up in the fall of 2016, the DOJ had not completed all that it aspired to. It rushed to reach settlements with foreign banks that had shown less urgency to resolve the allegations than some of their U.S. counterparts.
Less than a week before Trump’s inauguration, the DOJ announced that Deutsche Bank had agreed to pay a $3.1 billion civil penalty, and that Credit Suisse would pay $2.48 billion. But there were holdouts, including Barclays and RBS.
Prosecutors in Brooklyn wanted Barclays to pay somewhere within a range in the high single digits of billions of dollars, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. Barclays balked, drawing a line at $2 billion, according to a Bloomberg News account.
Barclays hired an all-star team of defense lawyers. The roster included Karen Seymour, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell who had previously served as chief of the criminal division in the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan and has since become general counsel at Goldman Sachs.
Also on Barclays’ legal team was Kannon Shanmugam, a former high-ranking official in the George W. Bush DOJ who was then a partner at Williams & Connolly.
With the two sides far apart in December 2016, the DOJ sued Barclays. Prosecutors also brought civil charges against two former executives at the bank who played key roles in its pre-crisis subprime mortgage operations.
Suing was an unusual step — cases against large corporations normally settle before a complaint is filed — and it was meant to send an implicit message to Barclays. Because the DOJ had been forced to go to court, the British bank could expect the price tag of an eventual settlement to be higher.
Barclays was making the opposite bet: that it would be able to negotiate a more favorable settlement once Trump appointees were in place at DOJ.
In a 192-page complaint, the DOJ alleged that Barclays engaged in fraud on a massive scale, deceiving investors about the characteristics of mortgages used to create securities that sold for tens of billions of dollars.
A Barclays employee commented during a 2006 phone call that one particular pool of mortgages was “about as bad as it can be,” but he did not abandon the loans or modify the bank’s standard disclosures to investors, according to the government’s complaint. In another example, when that same banker said that a particular pool of loans “scares the shit out of me,” because he believed the company that originated the mortgages was likely to go bankrupt soon, Barclays bought the loans anyway. The bank deliberately did not conduct due diligence on the mortgages and then packaged them into bonds, the complaint asserted, all the while falsely telling a rating agency that due diligence had been done on 100% of the loans.
“More than half of the underlying loans defaulted,” the complaint stated, causing huge losses for investors.
Barclays’ legal team argued that the bank should not pay higher penalties in a settlement than other banks had paid relative to their market share. Barclays had been a relatively small player in the residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, market, and its settlement should be sized accordingly, they reasoned.


This was an argument that the DOJ had long rejected. In a 2014 speech, then-Associate Attorney General Tony West argued that a firm’s market share should not outweigh evidence of the extent of its wrongdoing. “The facts and evidence of a particular case — they are what will ultimately matter the most,” he said.
In the Barclays matter, prosecutors in Brooklyn believed they had a strong case. The judge assigned to the case, U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, seemed to agree. “This complaint is probably one of the more fulsome complaints I’ve ever seen,” Matsumoto said at an April 2017 hearing.
But the view that ultimately mattered was the one held by a new crop of officials at Main Justice, the DOJ’s headquarters in Washington. Besides Rosenstein, who was not involved in the Barclays case, key players in the RMBS settlements included Trump administration political appointees in the associate attorney general’s office, according to people familiar with the talks.
Steve Cox, the deputy associate attorney general, oversaw the cases, reporting to Jesse Panuccio, the principal deputy associate attorney general. In February 2018, Panuccio became acting associate attorney general, the No. 3 position at the DOJ, after Rachel Brand resigned from the post.
Neither had much experience with federal prosecutions. Panuccio was a former lawyer to Florida Gov. Rick Scott, as well as the chief labor and land use official in Florida, and Cox was a onetime associate at WilmerHale who had spent six years as a corporate counsel at an oil company, Apache Corporation, before joining the DOJ.
Following communications with the Barclays legal team, DOJ officials in Washington conveyed a message to the staff prosecutors in Brooklyn: settle the case within a narrow range around $2 billion, or we will take the negotiations out of your hands. The instruction came via a spreadsheet that listed the dollar range.
For DOJ officials in Washington to dictate specific terms of a settlement was unusual. U.S. attorney offices generally have wide latitude in choosing what they investigate and in making prosecutorial decisions. “Involvement of DOJ in cases handled in the U.S. attorney’s offices is not common” but happens on big cases from time to time, said Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor who is now a partner at Patterson Belknap. During Obama-era negotiations, Main Justice had tried to show a united front with prosecutors who’d investigated the RMBS cases, according to former department officials.
At least one prosecutor acknowledged the internal rift between Brooklyn and Washington to the Barclays’ defense team, according to a source familiar with the matter. Once prosecutors in Brooklyn learned Main Justice’s position, this prosecutor communicated to the Barclays side that the bank had prevailed. Recalling how the deal went down, one government official said: “It seemed like a defeat.”
The staff prosecutors weren’t just disappointed about settling for a fraction of what they had sought back in 2016. They had brought civil charges against two former Barclays employees, Paul Menefee and John Carroll, and in exchange for dismissal, the two men agreed to pay a combined $2 million. But the agreement did not include language that precluded Barclays from footing the bill. That meant that Menefee and Carroll, who did not admit wrongdoing, might not have to pay a dime out of their own pockets.
Lawyers for Menefee and Carroll did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said, “The substantial penalty Barclays and its executives had to pay was an important step in recognizing the harm that was caused to the national economy and to investors in RMBS.”
At Main Justice, at least one official also regretted the Barclays deal, but from the opposite perspective. Cox told a prosecutor that he wished the Barclays settlement had been even smaller, but he explained that it wasn’t feasible to go lower because it had been reported that the bank offered to pay $2 billion, according to a person familiar with the conversation.
Cox did not respond to requests for comment.
Panuccio, who stepped down from the DOJ in the spring, declined to answer specific questions, citing the confidentiality of the department’s process. In an email response, he said, “The general narrative the questions seem to suggest is belied by the facts — including the fact that DOJ recovered historically significant sums in its 2018 and 2019 FIRREA settlements, and the fact that DOJ filed a major FIRREA suit against UBS in November 2018.” (FIRREA is the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, a law dating from the savings and loan scandals of the late ’80s.)
Barclays declined to comment.
While Barclays had been in active negotiations with the DOJ during the Obama administration, the RBS defense team had not. RBS did not want to enter negotiations until the prosecutors dropped the criminal investigation.
Boston prosecutors declined to do so. Mortgages that went into RBS’ securities suffered about $54 billion in losses, ravaging their customers’ investments. The prosecutors believed they had compiled damning evidence that RBS officials knew what they were doing was wrong. In one example, RBS’ chief credit officer in the United States called the mortgages that were going into the securities “total fucking garbage” with “fraud [that] was so rampant … [and] all random,” according to calls the prosecutors later quoted in the statement of facts against the bank. He stated that “the loans are all disguised to, you know, look okay kind of … in a data file.”
In 2016, the RBS defense team, which included former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, of WilmerHale, appealed to Stuart Delery, then the third-highest official at the DOJ. Delery knew Gorelick from their time at the DOJ. Despite that relationship, according to a person knowledgeable about the matter, Delery said he would not interfere with an ongoing investigation at a U.S. attorney’s office. (Delery did not respond to requests for comment. Gorelick directed questions to RBS.)
Then came November. A few months later, the Trump appointees arrived.
For a while, nothing changed. The Boston prosecutors continued their investigation, more convinced than ever that the RBS conduct merited a criminal charge. They wrote what’s known as a “prosecution memo,” which they had begun during the Obama administration, describing the underlying criminal acts under FIRREA.
Such a move would have been groundbreaking. The Obama DOJ had used FIRREA, but for civil charges. And the Boston prosecutors did not want to stop there. They argued for first charging the bank criminally, and then moving on to seek criminal charges against individual bankers. Those would have been the first of their kind.
They never got that far.
In time, Trump political appointees such as Panuccio and Cox began to figure out their way around the department. The RBS defense team, including Gorelick, requested meetings with top officials. Gorelick again had a connection with a key DOJ official. She had worked with Cox, earlier in his career when he was an associate at WilmerHale, defending BP in investigations of the Deepwater Horizon spill.
The defense group now also included Mark Filip of Kirkland & Ellis, representing the British government’s interest in RBS. Filip, who did not respond to requests for comment, has a special stature. During his tenure as deputy attorney general, he had codified the conditions prosecutors had to assess in bringing cases against corporations, which are today known as the “Filip Factors.” Prosecutors are supposed to weigh a variety of issues, such as how serious offenses are and whether the company has cooperated with investigators. As a private sector big hitter, companies hire him, in the view of prosecutors, to explain why his factors are not met in a given case.


The RBS team was able to meet with the No. 2 at the DOJ, Rosenstein. It’s unusual, though not unprecedented, for a defense team to get access to such a high-level official. The RBS team persuaded Rosenstein.
In the spring of 2018, Rosenstein informed Andrew Lelling, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, that his office couldn’t pursue criminal charges against RBS. Rosenstein said he didn’t want the DOJ treating RBS differently from other banks, which faced only civil investigations. (The Massachusetts U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment on the details of the RBS settlement. Rosenstein, who left the DOJ in May, did not respond to inquiries.)
RBS spokeswoman Linda Harper confirmed that the Boston U.S. attorney’s office had recommended criminal prosecution and that the bank had met first with Delery and then with Rosenstein.
“The argument we made was for fairness and parity,” she said. The bank’s defense team, she added, argued that “Main Justice should ensure that like cases are treated alike.”
The Boston team was disappointed and angry. It argued that prosecutors charge people when they have the necessary evidence, even if they cannot charge all people who committed the same crime. And it maintained that the decision went against department policy. In May 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo directing prosecutors to charge defendants with the most serious provable crimes carrying the highest penalties.
“It calls into question whether the memo meant what it says when it came to white-collar prosecutions,” a person familiar with the decision said.
Once the case was downgraded, the Boston team turned to deciding on the monetary settlement. Internally, prosecutors had discussed seeking a settlement in the $9 billion to $10 billion range, reflecting their belief that the RBS conduct was especially egregious.
At one point in the spring after the Rosenstein meetings, Main Justice sent Boston a similar spreadsheet that it sent to other U.S. attorney offices concerning their open cases, including those against Barclays, Japanese bank Nomura and Swiss bank UBS. For RBS, the range was between around $4.5 billion to about $6.6 billion.


The Boston prosecutors tried to get the settlement as close to the top of the range as they could. But they were thwarted even in that attempt. Cox told the Boston team that the DOJ would “call the bluff” of RBS and tell the bank it would take $4.9 billion.
Prosecutors thought the DOJ had caved. They complained to Cox that Main Justice had authorized the office to seek as much as $6.6 billion. Cox’s reply: But RBS won’t go that high.

269,Why Minorities May be Socially Conservative But Vote Democratic,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/why-minorities-may-be-socially-conservative-but-vote-democratic/,"Often you may encounter minorities or even Democrats who live a socially conservative lifestyle and wonder: Why do they consistently vote Democratic?
Those minorities/Democrats who are socially conservative—we are socially conservatives for ourselves. We are not out to push our own lifestyle choices and personal values onto other people.
I happen to live a life that most Republican social conservatives would laud. I am a white, straight, middle-aged, married guy. I’ve been faithfully married to the same woman for decades now, never divorced. I don’t drink, except a little bit of wine on rare occasions, I don’t smoke, I don’t do drugs, or MaryJ, I don’t sleep around on my wife—but I don’t expect everyone else to do the same. It’s none of my business.

I swear, Republican social conservatives are the biggest busybodies on the planet. They are very worried about who every else is having sex with, who they marry—or not, what substances they put in their bodies, what religion they practice, and so on. But all too often, they don’t seem to worry too much about themselves. Their social conservatism is more oriented toward other people.
See this person? That’s Democrat turned Republican Kim Davis, the County Clerk for Rowan County, Kentucky. She was unable to function in her official capacity for fear a gay person might marry—against her religion. She was worried about other people. But for herself, she has been married four times to three different men—and, even bore two children out of wedlock. This is also against her religion, yet she expected and received marriage licenses each time. Her social conservatism is for other people.
How about this guy? Republican Newt Gingrich. A great and very public social conservative, who was highly critical of Bill Clinton. He abandoned one wife when she was sick with cancer to marry his mistress, and wanted an open marriage.
Here’s pro-life Republican Tim Murphy, who wanted his mistress to get an abortion.
Here is conservative senator David Vitter, R-LA, who had a habit of utilizing the services of sex workers, and was a frequent customer for the DC Madam. Another social conservative—at least for other people.
Here is Republican Roy Moore, who nearly won the senate race in Alabama in 2016. A very staunch, hardcore social conservative—at least when it comes to other people. But his thing is pedophilia, which even some Alabama voters couldn’t stomach.
Here is Republican former senator Larry “Wide Stance” Craig, another staunch, and anti-gay, social conservative who was busted for soliciting sex with other men in public restrooms.
Don’teven get me started on the current resident of the Oval Office (which will need to be fumigated once he has cleared out). And I can keep going on and on and on.
The Republican brand of social conservatism is for Other People. And all the people who continue to vote for them—some of them might be socially conservative for themselves, but most of them? I doubt it, and in any case, their political focus is on other people. They very much want to force their social conservatism on other people.

It’s true that liberals/Democrats have had their share of sex scandals, but a) there are more likely to be consequences—compare Eliot Spitzer to Dave Vitter. Both had the exact same kind of scandal—prostitution, yet Spitzer had to resign and Vitter continued on in the US Senate, with the support of his party. And b) liberals and Democrats are not in the business of trying to force our social conservatism on other people. Our social conservatism is a personal matter only.

270,New Documents Raise Ethical and Billing Concerns About the NRA’s Outside Counsel,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/new-documents-raise-ethical-and-billing-concerns-about-the-nras-outside-counsel/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
In 2018, accountants for the National Rifle Association began cataloging for its board of directors questionable financial arrangements that had led to millions of dollars in payments to a group of top executives and consultants. The NRA was experiencing cash flow problems, and the accountants were trying to address what they believed to be serious financial mismanagement.
For a year and a half, the NRA has employed an outside counsel, William A. Brewer III, who represents the organization in high-profile legal disputes and is also deeply involved in internal decision-making. The accountants believed the financial dealings they had found could jeopardize the organization’s nonprofit standing with regulators. Yet, according to a former senior official in the NRA’s treasurer’s office, Brewer tried to thwart their efforts to draw attention to the problematic payments.
The former senior employee, Emily Cummins, who worked for 12 years in the NRA’s treasurer’s office, quietly resigned in November as the group’s internal strife escalated. Cummins, in a written statement that began circulating this month among NRA leaders, including at least one board member, alleges that Brewer obstructed the work of NRA accountants and vastly exacerbated the organization’s financial woes as he charged it hefty legal fees. Cummins confirmed that she had produced the statement, which was obtained by ProPublica, but declined to provide any additional comments. Brewer’s firm said its work was justified and of the highest quality.
The statement lays out a list of allegations regarding Brewer’s legal work and his treatment of NRA staff as questions surfaced about his law firm’s billings, which totaled $24 million over a 13-month period. In the first quarter of 2019, Brewer’s firm charged over $97,000 per day, according to internal NRA documents posted anonymously online.


Cummins accuses Brewer of trying to intimidate, deceive and silence NRA staff who were processing his bills while some accountants were growing increasingly troubled by the organization’s mismanagement, exorbitant spending and questionable deals involving conflicts of interest. Former Brewer colleagues as well as written correspondence obtained by ProPublica broadly supported her claims.
Cummins wrote in her statement that Brewer “intimidated NRA staff and threatened our professional livelihoods.” She alleged that he used pressure tactics with staffers “to keep them acquiescent,” compiling what she called “burn books” filled with personal information that he could use against individuals.
“I witnessed what appeared to be unrealistic and duplicative billing from Bill Brewer,” Cummins wrote. “I witnessed that Bill Brewer himself created a 2018 cash flow crunch by interfering with accounts payable to prioritize paying himself immediately versus other NRA vendors that had been providing goods or services for months without payment, also jeopardizing the NRA’s biweekly staff payroll.”
In a lengthy response to Cummins’ account, the Brewer law firm and the NRA defended Brewer’s work and called his legal fees standard. The Brewer firm pointed to an NRA email it said Cummins wrote in August 2018 praising the firm. “They are good lawyers and seem to be good people as well,” it said.
Svetlana M. Eisenberg, a Brewer partner, told ProPublica that “the notion that our research team compiles opposition research, or ‘burn books,’ regarding clients or their employees is simply not true.”
Craig Spray, the NRA’s chief financial officer, said the NRA is “current on all its vendor payments.”
Brewer has been a central behind-the-scenes force in the internal struggle that broke out between the NRA’s top executive Wayne LaPierre and ousted president Oliver North. LaPierre has entrusted the future of his organization to Brewer, and in a statement this week said the organization has “full confidence in Bill Brewer and his law firm.”
As the gun group has fractured, Brewer’s firm has been a key player in a series of expensive lawsuits against former business partners, government officials and North, in certain cases seeking damages worth tens of millions of dollars.
For the last three decades, the NRA has been one of the most influential special interest groups in the country. Without an infusion of cash, and a return to relative stability, it could find itself on the sidelines of the 2020 election, a dramatic difference from 2016. That year, campaign finance records show the organization spent over $30 million to help elect Donald Trump, more than any other special interest group.
Internal NRA documents previously obtained by The Trace and The New Yorker described expenses and questionable transactions and business arrangements involving top executives, favored vendors and consultants. Through Brewer, the NRA said it had “serious concerns about the accuracy” of the reporting but would not comment on “privileged communications or personnel matters.” Attorneys general in New York and Washington, D.C., have opened inquiries into whether the NRA violated its charitable status by providing excessive financial benefits to its executives and supporters. The D.C. attorney general’s office declined to comment on its inquiry beyond an initial statement, and the New York office did not respond to requests for comment.


This month, four NRA board members publicly called for an “independent review of the millions of dollars in payments to Brewer, Attorneys & Counselors for legal fees.” But other NRA senior officials continue to defend the group. Carolyn Meadows, the NRA’s president, told ProPublica, “I have never worked with an outside law firm that is more on call, attentive and positively in tune to the needs of their client.” Charles Cotton, the NRA’s first vice president and chairman of the audit committee, added that Cummins’ allegations “reflect a misinformed view of the Brewer firm, its billings, and its advocacy for the NRA.”
Brewer’s NRA legal strategy suffered a setback in May, in a First Amendment case against a New York state financial regulator. A judge ruled that the NRA could collect no damages from defendants in their official capacities, even if it prevailed.
Brewer’s firm has offices in Dallas and New York, and has represented celebrities like 50 Cent and major corporations such as 3M, which ultimately settled an environmental suit for $850 million in 2018. Starting in the mid-’80s, he gained a reputation for pioneering unusually aggressive legal tactics, which could yield successful outcomes for corporate clients.
But the tactics caused others to question the firm’s conduct. In 1998, the Dallas Observer ran a lengthy story on Brewer, describing his firm, then called Bickel & Brewer, as “a pariah within the local legal community, accused of pushing the ethical envelope, running up the costs of litigation, and destroying the gentility of the Dallas Bar.” Brewer, a native New Yorker, characterized his firm’s approach to litigation at the time as “zealous advocacy,” marketing his practice to potential clients as “New York-quality.”
“Bill’s representation of the NRA is a classic example of ‘servicing the client to death,’” Hal Marshall, a former Bickel & Brewer partner, told ProPublica. “We tried to leave no stone unturned in our cases, and it often yielded great results. On the other hand the bills were hefty.”
In 2016, Brewer was fined over $133,000 for attempting to influence potential jurors and witnesses in a Texas case. He denied any impropriety and has appealed the ruling, raising the total to $177,000, which the Texas Supreme Court will hear arguments on soon. In 2018, a judge found that Brewer had failed to disclose the Texas fine in an NRA suit against an insurance broker in Virginia. After the omission was reported by The Trace, a judge threw Brewer off the case.
In addition to Cummins’ statement, ProPublica obtained text messages and email composed by former Brewer employees in March 2018 that alleged unethical behavior by the firm. Four former Brewer colleagues — three of whom were abruptly fired over the last two years — described a pattern of disregard for ethical billing and conduct. The texts and email were sent just before the NRA began to heavily invest its dwindling resources in litigation by the firm.
Early in March, an attorney who had worked as a Brewer associate sent an email to another New York City-based law firm. The firm worked for a hedge fund that was locked in a legal fight against Eco-Bat, a lead production company represented by Brewer’s firm. “A number of attorneys have recently left Brewer, concerned about the firm’s ethics violations,” it said.
It went on to say that a Brewer attorney believed he had been fired “for refusal to violate ethical rules.” The attorney thought he had identified a disqualifiable conflict of interest involving an attorney on his team, the email said. When the Brewer lawyer “confirmed his initial analysis,” the email said, “he was told to drop the matter and terminated the following Monday.”
Sarah Rogers, a partner at the Brewer firm, dismissed the emails and told ProPublica, “We cannot discuss this matter, except to note that the former associate’s claims are false and have already been rejected by an arbitrator.” Eco-Bat’s chairman and CEO, Howard M. Meyers, praised Brewer’s work and said that the litigation was “a stunning, multibillion-dollar achievement.” He added: “I’ve been Bill’s friend and client for decades. I have never witnessed, nor would I expect, anything less than the highest ethical standards from Bill and his firm.”


Travis Carter, a spokesman for the Brewer firm, told ProPublica, “All time charged to client matters is scrutinized internally for accuracy, transparency and value.”
Later that spring, Brewer brought a lawsuit on behalf of the NRA against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York Department of Financial Services and the regulator’s then top official, Maria Vullo. The New York officials had released statements advising those doing business with the NRA in New York to assess the potential reputational risks of maintaining ties to the gun group. The suit accused the New York officials of engaging in a thinly veiled conspiracy to destroy the organization, costing it “tens of millions of dollars in damages.”
LaPierre touted the lawsuit in a speech at the 2019 Conservative Political Action Conference. “In real time right before your very eyes, we, the National Rifle Association, on behalf of all Americans, are fighting perhaps the most important piece of First Amendment constitutional advocacy in the history of our country,” he said.
The lawsuit, which was seeking to recover the money the NRA had supposedly lost as a result of the New York officials’ actions, became the centerpiece of an urgent fundraising campaign. On an NRA webpage soliciting donations, the text said, “Please give as generously as you can — and help win this life-or-death legal battle for the survival of the NRA and freedom.”
Over the last four months, the Brewer firm has also been involved in legal actions against once-sacred NRA allies. The NRA recently sued Ackerman McQueen, its public relations firm for more than three decades. Ackerman shaped the NRA’s image, and, through productions like NRATV, placed it at the vanguard of the culture wars. Ackerman has historically been the NRA’s most costly vendor — in 2017, the firm was paid more than $40 million. In a lawsuit in Virginia state court, the gun group accused Ackerman of engaging in deceptive billing practices, and leaking damaging documents that show LaPierre using the firm’s funds for lavish travel and custom suits.
Another Brewer suit, filed in New York, is against Oliver North, who spent a tumultuous year serving as the NRA’s president until he was pushed out in April, at the organization’s annual convention. During the meeting, a leadership struggle unfolded between North and LaPierre, who alleged that North threatened to release damaging information in order to extort him into resigning. In its suit, the NRA claims that the former president engaged in a “failed coup attempt,” absolving it of having to cover North’s legal fees in connection with NRA-related litigation. The suit also, in an unrelated aside, accuses Chris Cox, the NRA’s longtime top lobbyist, of taking part in the alleged scheme to overthrow LaPierre. Cox, who was beloved by many NRA staff and viewed as the natural successor to LaPierre, resigned in June. Before North stepped down, he was seeking to audit Brewer’s billings.
Ackerman, North and Cox have steadfastly denied the NRA’s allegations. In May, Ackerman filed a defamation suit against the organization, asking for $50 million in damages. That same month, the judge in the New York case, Thomas J. McAvoy, dismissed the organization’s recovery claims; it would get no damages from Cuomo or Vullo in their official capacities or the DFS. The NRA is still pursuing its First Amendment claims.
During the summer of 2018, Cummins and her fellow accountants took care to document their work. A variety of NRA vendors, including Ackerman McQueen, were receiving what some accountants considered unjustified payments, and an array of NRA officials and contractors had been involved in what the accountants saw as expense abuses and questionable deals not initially approved by the board’s audit committee.
According to Cummins’ statement, Brewer misled the NRA’s board and “used information gathered by NRA staff to fit different purposes and to frame a different story to the board of directors.” It also says that Brewer “effectively silenced NRA staff who uncovered issues needing board of directors attention,” and “influenced members of the board” by “selectively withholding information relevant to their decision making.”
Rogers, the Brewer partner, dismissed Cummins’ statement and said it “may reflect a radical misunderstanding of certain work my firm performed.” Cotton, the NRA’s first vice president, said, “I am not aware of any concerns that would preclude the firm from representing the NRA, period.”
Cummins concluded her statement by saying that, while still an NRA employee, she tried to sound an alarm regarding the NRA’s legal representation, writing, “I raised concerns about Bill Brewer internally and with the board audit committee.” According to Cummins, she was ignored.
Update, Aug. 2, 2019: Three of the four NRA board members who called for an independent review of the law firm billings of outside counsel William A. Brewer III resigned on Aug. 1, two days after this article was published. In their resignation letter, they said their “confidence in the NRA’s leadership has been shattered.”

271,Will Congress Take Action on Gun Laws After This Weekend’s Mass Shootings?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/will-congress-take-action-on-gun-laws-after-this-weekends-mass-shootings/,"Two mass shootings within 24 hours over the weekend not only left more than 30 victims dead, but raised real questions whether the nation’s political leaders could ever adequately address the crisis of gun violence.
The nation’s news was whipsawed over the weekend with apparently unrelated shootings, in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio.
“If 249 mass shootings in the space of a year is not enough to force political change, why would the 250th one be? Jeffrey [Goldberg] reminded me he and I sat at this table on this panel the morning after the Tree of Life shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh and we had no particular answers then and I don’t know that we have anymore answers now about why this would be the turning point that so many Americans say they want to see,” journalist Susan Page said during a panel discussion on the CBS News program Face The Nation.

Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat who represents an Ohio district in Congress in Congress and is among some two dozen Democrats running for president, had particularly sharp language for congressional Republicans who have been blocking passage of even modest gun control measures.
“You watch videos and see Dillards [department store] in the background or a church in the background, and no one feels safe anymore,” Ryan said. “And there is a bottleneck in the United States Senate with [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell. We passed in the House of Representatives a few weeks back, background checks. A basic step 90 percent of the American people support, and the Republicans need to quite frankly get their shit together and stop pandering to the NRA. All the people we saw, they had hopes and dreams. They had plans this week. They were going to do things. They were going to meet with their friends. They were going to meet with their family. They were going to go to church. And now they’re gone because in this country we’re so dysfunctional that we can’t do basic things.
“And it’s got to stop, and we have to put pressure on Mitch McConnell to start with the background check bill,” Ryan added.

Former Ohio governor and congressman John Kasich agreed that solution involves continued public pressure.
“You want to gun control legislation people need to start marching like Parkland, Florida,” Kasich said, referring to the shooting at a 2018 high school in a Florida town which left 17 students and staff dead. “Florida had no interest in passing gun control legislation whatsoever until thousands of incredibly brave students demanded it. The people of the state demanded it.”

272,Many Sides Blame Tough Trump Rhetoric for Mass Shootings,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/many-sides-blame-tough-trump-rhetoric-for-mass-shootings/,"A variety of sources point at least some of the blame for this past weekend’s dual mass shootings at Donald Trump and the kind of hateful rhetoric Trump has become known for.
Separate incidents in El Paso, Texas; and Dayton, Ohio took the life of at least 30 people. The gunman in the El Paso attack posted online an anti-immigration screed which reportedly echoed the rhetoric used by Trump.
“I think the rhetoric that the president uses mimics white nationalist talking points frequently,” said Derek Black, in an interview with CNN, which identified Black as a former white nationalist. “What white nationalists are trying to do when they are looking for recruits or convince them they have a following and they are not so bad, those things are the same sort of sentiments that the president campaigned on and says from the White House today, that communities of color are more dangerous, which is untrue, that immigrants are committing crimes and are replacing us and are hurting America.

“These attacking, offensive language, there are consequences so saying things like this,” Black added. “There are consequences to trying to tap into that hateful passion that it’s disingenuous to say that a movement that is based on that, whether it’s as mainstream as some forms of conservatism or the white nationalist movement, these outreaches that tap into some of the oldest forms of white supremacy in America are going to have consequences. Words have consequences.”
Beto O’Rourke, the former El Paso-area Democratic congressman currently running for president, also pinned blame on Trump.
“We have a problem with white nationalist terrorism in the United States of America today. So I don’t want to confuse people about what is going on or use a hypothetical about what if this was somebody else from a different background or profile. These are white men motivated by the kind of fear that this president traffics in,” O’Rourke said. “The mosque in Victoria, Texas, was burned to the ground on the same day that President Trump signed his order attempting to ban Muslim travel to the United States of America when he says after Charlottesville that klansman and white supremacist and Neo-Nazis are very fine people, the commander in chief is sending a very public signal to the rest of the country about what is permissible and in fact even when he encourages to happen.
“So let’s connect the dots here on what is happening and why it is happening and who is responsible for this right now. And the fact that it will take all of us, Republicans, Democrats, independents alike, rising up, standing up to be counted against what this president is doing, against this white nationalist racism, against this violence and getting this country back,” O’Rourke added. “They are saying that our differences are, in fact, dangerous. If your a Muslim, you’re inherently dangerous. If you are a immigrant, you are inherently dangerous. If you are an asylum-seeker, you are invading this country or infestation, those words have very real consequences. You don’t get mass shootings like these and torch mosques or put kids in cages until you have a president who is given people permission to do that and that is exactly what is happening in the United States of America today.”
The president even took criticism during a panel discussion on the usually pro-Trump Fox News.

“Well, a hard question, and I do believe that the president — let’s put it this way, I don’t think he makes a lot of effort to cool the tensions that already exist,” said Charles Lane of The Washington Post. “We have seen over last week how he tried to sort of rub hard on that sore spot of race. He lacks language it seems when the horrible events arise to speak convincingly to the whole country as one, bring the country together. I would hesitate to blame him for any particular incident. Just one quick point on what can be done: I do think that there are — there is no one fix, but there are things that can be done in terms of limiting access to assault weapons, the high capacity magazines that can be done, you would think that people could get behind.”

273,‘It’s Borderline Panic Both in Texas and in National Republican Circles’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/its-borderline-panic-both-in-texas-and-in-national-republican-circles/,"Rep. Will Hurd’s retirement announcement this week goes beyond the simple numbers–Hurd is the sixth Republican and the third from Texas to decline to seek re-election next year–the 41-year-old was seen both as a GOP rising star, and is the only black Republican in the House.
Hurd also was just one of four House Republicans to vote with Democrats to condemn as racist some of Donald Trump’s tweets against non-white female Democrats.
“I mean, it’s borderline panic both in Texas and in national Republican circles. The official line from the House GOP campaign committee is they’ll fight hard for this seat and it is a seat that they can win in good circumstances. But Hurd is a uniquely talented and hardworking candidate,” said Abby Livingston, Washington bureau chief for the Texas Tribune. “He raises a ton of money. Every Friday night he is flipping a coin at a high school football game in this huge district that is extremely hard to represent. So there is just a real sense this is going to be a hard seat to hold on to, but that someone who cares that much and works that hard is ready to leave Congress is the bigger question and a bigger issue for Republicans right now.”

Hurd may make a political comeback after Trump passes off the political stage, Livingston said.
“I think he still perceives himself as the future, and part of that is not having to go to votes every single day and having to answer questions about Donald Trump,” she said. “And that this may be something about waiting this out, seeing where the party goes after Trump leaves office, whenever that happens, and being able to still reach out to general election voters at a later date, which could be years from now. I think it’s a sign of his youth and that he is still very ambitious.”
But in the short term, Republicans will feel a loss with Hurd’s retirement, agreed MSNBC reporter Garrett Haake.

“It’s really hard to overstate. The fact that Republicans will almost certainly lose that seat in Texas is probably the smallest of the implications here. Hurd was the last Republican representing any stretch of the U.S./Mexico border, so now Republicans lose a credible voice on border issues,” Haake said. “And as Abby pointed out, he is also the only African-American member of the Republican Conference. There is only about a dozen women left in the Republican Conference in the House. The Republican House Conference now is almost entirely just white men. If you’re a party who is trying to expand the map anywhere else, losing someone like Will Hurd is really just disastrous for Republicans in the House.”

274,It ‘Amazes Me’ They Spent More Time Attacking a ‘Wildly Popular’ Obama than Talking About Trump,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/it-amazes-me-they-spent-more-time-attacking-a-wildly-popular-obama-than-talking-about-trump/,"A variety of political observers and strategists expressed confusion and dismay with how much President Barack Obama and his legacy came under fire from other Democrats during this week’s CNN Democratic presidential debate.
From his policies for healthcare, to immigration, the Democrats on the debate stage in Detroit, Mich., took repeated aim at Obama in order to land shots on former vice president Joe Biden, who is running for president this year.
“First of all, Barack Obama’s approval rating with Democrats is 96 percent. Donald Trump’s approval rating with Democrats, 4 percent. So the fact that we spent more time talking about a wildly popular president and not talking about Donald Trump is just — ceases to amaze me,” said former Obama political adviser Jim Messina. “And on health care we just won the House of Representatives in large part because we won women voters across this country on health care, on going after Trump’s attempts to get rid of pre-existing conditions, get rid of some of the protection that ObamaCare give us. And instead of talking about that and staying on the offense with Republicans, we’re proposing pie in the sky schemes that will have us on the defense.”

CNN host Chris Cuomo made it clear that Democrats attacking Obama was a bad idea.
“Hasn’t this president made it painfully obvious that he ain’t here to compare plans? He said he won’t even release his health care plan until after the 2020 election. Medicare for all as an issue for voters, take a look at the poll. In-party it’s popularish, but this is the whole country. So I’m not arguing that plans of course not. Plans matter, but not as much as it matters to connect with people on the concern and anxiety that drives the need for plans to fix what ails them. Are plans as compelling as feeling people’s pain? You know, like [Bill] Clinton, like Obama. They weren’t detailed plan guys. Remember the vision thing? … ” Cuomo said. “When did you decide that attacking a president was a good idea but that president should be Obama? Almost more so than the president you will face, the one you all call a criminal and a pathological liar.”
Democrats can make the same points, but in a different way, according to Kirsten Powers, a political analyst and former official in the Clinton administration.
“Well, it’s fair game. It’s not out of bounds. I’m just not sure it’s productive. So certainly President Obama, when he was running for office, he was, you know — and he was running against Hillary Clinton in the primary, he had no problem criticizing things that happened in the Clinton administration. And I think that it’s fine to have some criticisms,” she said. “But I would do it in a different way. I think the Democrats would be well served to say, ‘We want to build on the successes that Obama had,’ versus sort of treating it as though these successes didn’t occur.
“And even the way they’ve portrayed his immigration policy, which I had a lot of criticism for at the time, you still have to recognize what he was dealing with, right?” Powers added. “That he had a Republican Congress, for example, that he actually did do some good things such as the Dreamers Act. So instead, you know, you have Bill de Blasio painting the picture he was the deporter in chief and nothing else. That’s Joe Biden’s job to push back on that kind of stuff.”

275,"Gabbard, Harris Continue Feud Off Stage",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/gabbard-harris-continue-feud-off-stage/,"Democratic presidential rivals Tulsi Gabbard and Kamala Harris kept up the argument that began Wednesday evening during the Democratic presidential debate off-stage this week, as well.
Gabbard, a congresswoman from Hawaii who has been struggling in the polls among Democratic presidential contenders, took direct aim during Wednesday’s encounter at Harris’s record as a San Francisco district attorney and attorney general of California.

Gabbard not only continued that line of attack the next day, but amplified it, criticizing Harris’s racial credibility.
“Honestly, it’s pathetic that when confronted with the facts and the truth about her record that she claims to be proud of as a prosecutor, as attorney general of California, all she can do is lob cheap smears,” said Gabbard. “You know, the American people, voters deserve better than this, especially when her whole campaign is predicated on being a champion for the people, being a champion for black and brown people in this country who have been on the brunt end of racial injustice and an unjust criminal justice system for too long.
“This is all a lie because when she was in a position to do something about it, when she was in a position to make a difference and truly be a champion for the people, she furthered and perpetuated this unfair, unjust system that harmed many black and brown people in the state of California,” the congresswoman added.
For her part, Harris dismissed Gabbard’s jabs as a mere effort to raise Gabbard’s profile among voters.
“Well, I mean, listen, this is going to sound immodest, but I’m obviously a top tier candidate, and so I did expect that I would be on the stage and take hits tonight because there are a lot of people that are trying to make the stage for the next debate,” Harris said.

276,Extreme Weather and Climate Change Threaten to Worsen the Affordable Housing Crisis,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/extreme-weather-and-climate-change-threaten-to-worsen-the-affordable-housing-crisis/,"Homelessness and the lack of affordable housing are already at crisis levels in the United States, but extreme weather events, fueled by climate change, threaten to compound these problems. A new Center for American Progress report, “A Perfect Storm: Extreme Weather as an Affordable Housing Crisis Multiplier,” explains how climate change is exacerbating the affordable housing crisis and lays out solutions for building strong, healthy, fair, accessible, and affordable communities that are resilient to existing and future climate impacts.
The report from the left-leaning, Washington DC-based think tank calls on policymakers to simultaneously address climate change and housing issues, which would save money and lives while improving the health and livelihood of communities across the nation. It would also help to address the national shortage of 7 million affordable and available rental homes for extremely low-income renters, an issue that disproportionately affects communities of color and disabled people.

The report outlines five key recommendations to help alleviate the problem:
Support equitable evacuation and disaster recovery for all survivors of natural disasters
Expand investments in federal rental and homeless assistance programs
Prioritize equitable housing policies and just community development
Invest in infrastructure that is built to last, including by improving the design and resilience of new and existing infrastructure
Increase funding for disaster mitigation and climate change adaptation strategies
“Previous attempts to address the devastating impacts of natural disasters have failed to consider the intertwined threats of more extreme weather due to climate change and the lack of affordable housing,” said Guillermo Ortiz, co-author of the report and research assistant for Energy and Environment at the Center for American Progress. “It is important for policymakers across all levels of government to be diligent in building more resilient and prepared communities.”

277,July CNN Democratic Debate Night 1,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/july-2019-cnn-democratic-debate-night-1/,"Well, we’re staying up late again to watch the next round of Democratic debates, and give all the candidates the grades they deserve. For any teachers or students out there, feel free to calculate their debate average after these two nights are over.
The first grade I’m going to give is to the networks, since I had much higher hopes for them than I received.

The Debate Hosts/Creators— Grade: C+
While the moderators did a good job of stopping candidates who went overtime (so, like, all of them) and the camera people effectively juxtaposed debaters who were directly responding to each other, the entire debate was lackluster for the simple reason that there were far too many candidates on the stage. Only Eric Swalwell officially dropped out, and he was replaced by Steve Bullock. The bar for qualification was set far too low, and it really detracted from the serious candidates’ analysis.
What about the candidates themselves? Here we go.
Elizabeth Warren: A+

I cannot overstate Elizabeth Warren’s talent as a debater. I disagree with her on several key policy points, but every time, she manages to make me think, if just for a second, that she’s there for me and my interests. She honestly has the whole package on stage: she plays up the emotions, but has real plans. I can’t remember a single question she didn’t answer with “I have a comprehensive plan for this.” This made her credible when she attacked candidates for always criticizing progressivism instead of advocating for their own plans. Warren is definitely too far left for me as I don’t support mandating government healthcare for all or free college, but every time she speaks, I listen.

Pete Buttigieg: A-

Buttigieg held his ground, and to a degree, that’s all you can ask. He remains the most
successful moderate, outside of Joe Biden, and has the remarkable ability to push the party left while not alienating people. His plan to decriminalize immigration, for example, is pretty radical, but it didn’t come across that way on the stage. I can’t think of anything Buttigieg did badly, and
he played his major weakness (his age) very well. As a young millenial myself, I really identified with Buttigieg when he spoke of growing up in the era of school shootings, to give an example.
Turning his greatest weakness into a strength gets high marks from me. On the other hand, he wasn’t all that interesting and fresh, so no A or A+ there.
John Delaney: B+ (most improved for sure!)
John Delaney really, really surprised me last night. I was not a fan of him at all in the first debate, and he came back with a vengeance in this debate. The first debate, he was a sad sack, definitely the less interesting moderate candidate. Last night, he fought for his time, and didn’t let the more progressive candidates bully him into silence. He grounded his ideas in financial responsibility, and I think cemented his status as the conservative Democratic candidate. I watched the debate with a more blue dog relative, who kept saying “I like this guy!”
These candidates were, to me the Top 4 by far. Everyone else was forgettable or infamous.

Let’s move on to our bottom 6:

Amy Klobuchar: B-
I really want to like Amy Klobuchar. She has comprehensive plans, she’s a powerful senator, she takes on Donald Trump, she should be the whole package. A few times when she spoke, I got that presidential vibe from her. Her stance and answer on the NRA was one of those. The problem is
that those times were few and far between. Klobuchar is experienced and powerful. She should, by all accounts be doing better. Yet, she wasn’t aggressive and faded into the background in the debate. I don’t see her bouncing back. She’s not bad… just nothing special in a race where you need to be.


Steve Bullock: C+

Before we start, I have to give Steve Bullock credit where credit is due: he sounds like a ski bum, and I’m kind of here for it. I could totally picture him getting off the mountain and being like “Stoked for the pow today duuuude.” He has a unique perspective as the Montana governor, and brought a fresh perspective in that sense. Despite being a newcomer, Bullock has a solid record in a very red state, and is better equipped for the gun issue at the very least than the
more progressive candidates. That said, I don’t see him overtaking the other moderates, and he’s not a fit at all for the more progressive wing. He also wasn’t confrontational, which is something that you absolutely need as a first-timer, and as one of the lower-tier candidates.
He’s not bad, and passes, but doesn’t go further.

Beto O’Rourke C+

Beto was okay. Yeah, that’s kind of it.
Alright, I’m joking, but in all seriousness, Beto didn’t push very hard last night. He has a lot to offer as a former representative from a border state, and I did like how he brought up Texas and its specific issues, but there aren’t many plans that are uniquely his. I can’t think of a single idea that was just Beto’s, that distinguishes him as a candidate. Warren, Buttigieg, Delaney, even Klobuchar, yep. I can. Beto seems right now like he deserves more political power, maybe as a VP pick or in Congress again, but not as the president.
John Hickenlooper: D+

Hickenlooper last night was like that kid that does the work grudgingly, and you pass him equally grudgingly. I was surprised he had the donors to be on stage, and he came across the debate’s Debbie Downer. He barely spoke, and when he did speak, it was to tell progressive candidates their plans wouldn’t work. He didn’t do anything egregious, but that’s hardly flying
colors. You don’t win elections on pessimism.


Bernie: D

Unpopular opinion: Bernie absolutely bungled this debate. He had a ton of speaking time, and a ton of chances to do well, and he wasted them. Bernie came across as angry and ranting, eyes bulging out of his red face. Warren, on the other hand, had the same ideas, but was enthusiastic yet controlled. Warren has managed to steal Sanders’ plans and energy, making the choice between them seem obvious. Bernie maintains his socialist stance, while Warren takes his ideas but proudly declares herself a capitalist. Despite not being much younger than Warren, Bernie seemed old last night, a has-been rather than a to-be. If you’re progressive, and want Medicare for All, it’s unclear to me why you’d want Bernie over Elizabeth Warren. I know the pundits probably think Bernie did well last night, and maybe this is due to my disagreement with him, but I felt as though he spent far too much time taking potshots at the wealthy and far too little time distinguishing himself from Elizabeth Warren, who, frankly, is just a better debater.

Tim Ryan: D

Oh, no. Tim Ryan. I want to fail him, but I need to reserve that spot. Tim Ryan did not do well.
He nakedly appealed to unions and manufacturing, knowing full well that manufacturing is gone from the United States. He sought to cling to an old vision of America, one that Americans are just starting to heal from. Tim, you can’t bring the jobs back. Trump thought he could, and we all knew better. Instead, Trump’s tariffs hurt Americans and their businesses. Ryan didn’t seem to be in the 21st century with his ideas, and so I think it’s time for him to drop out. He’s far too conservative for a Democrat, without the charm of some of the other blue dogs in the race.
Manufacturing is not coming back, Tim. The 1980s called and they want you back.

Marianne Williamson: F

So, we’ve finally arrived at the bottom of the podium, Marianne Williamson.
Williamson’s appearance onstage at this debate is a large part of my annoyance at the hosts. She has no political experience, and isn’t a serious candidate. They minimized her speaking time, sure, but
the time she did have was unadulterated idealism and inexperience. The phrase “dark psychic force” is fit for a fantasy novel, not a presidential debate. On immigration, she wanted to talk about chemicals and the pharmaceutical industry. Williamson stinks of pseudoscience, and it’s plain to see. She also is the only candidate who insists on discussing reparations, planning to give $500 billion to black Americans. How will she pay for this? Will struggling non-black taxpayers be content to just fork over their hard-earned money because of their ancestors’ (or other people’s ancestors’) misdeeds? Won’t other oppressed groups deserve money, too? I get Williamson’s heart is in the right place on this, but only a candidate with no political experience
could think this is workable. Only a candidate who thinks policy plans are “wonkiness” could think so. Williamson needs to be done.

278,Let’s Talk About The 7th Maryland Congressional District,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/lets-talk-about-the-7th-maryland-congressional-district/,"Let’s talk about Maryland’s 7th Congressional District, the subject of Trump’s latest weird tweetstorm, and aside from reminding Donald Trump that he actually is the president of Maryland’s 7th Congressional District, let’s look at it just from a “facts” standpoint first.

….As proven last week during a Congressional tour, the Border is clean, efficient & well run, just very crowded. Cumming District is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 27, 2019
Let’s focus in on “His district is the worst in the USA.”
What does the 7th district look like? Here you go. Most of Baltimore, Ellicott City to the west, most of Columbia below that, a thin channel up to Reisterstown, and a big block of land bordering on Hampstead, heading out to Baldwin, ending at Kingsville in the east.
The top employers in the district are certainly things you would probably associate with the “worst ever,” you know, like Johns Hopkins University, and the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System. Because when you think of the word “terrible” of course the first word that comes to mind is “Johns Hopkins.”


Other top employers in the district include the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
One good way to measure the quality of a geographic area’s demographics is “median income.”
The median income in this district is $60,020, higher than the US average.
The worst districts by this metric are all below $40K.
Maryland’s 7th ranks 169th out of 436 districts, meaning there are 267 districts worse than Maryland’s 7th in median income.
Maybe he was talking about education? I mean what? Some 37 percent of residents in Maryland’s 7th have a bachelor’s degree or higher right?
Of course, there are 25 Districts with 17 percent or lower, so that can’t be right. In fact, 348 out of 436 congressional districts rank lower in this statistic…
Wait, it’s gotta be unemployment, right? I mean, that District has an 8.3 percent unemployment rate!
Yeah, sorry. Tied with Michigan’s 6th and California’s 19th districts for 56th place, somewhat low on the totem pole, but nowhere near “worst.”
The “Worst Districts” are all in double digits. Michigan’s 13th is over 18 percent.
So what is it? What makes Maryland’s 7th so bad? What’s …
It wouldn’t happen to be talking about the Maryland Congressional District with the highest percentage of African Americans and the second-lowest percentage of white people, would we?
We wouldn’t be talking about a district with a greater percentage of African Americans than 421 other congressional districts in the US, putting it top 15 there, would we?
Yeahhhhh……We kinda would.
So…If no human beings want to live there…Who exactly does want to live there, Don? Sorry. I didn’t hear you.
The ultrasonic frequency you’re using is a bit out of my hearing range.

279,ACLU Asks Federal Court To Halt Ongoing Family Separations,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/aclu-asks-federal-court-to-halt-ongoing-family-separations/,"The American Civil Liberties Union asked a federal judge Tuesday to block the Trump administration from continuing to separate hundreds of families in defiance of a previous court order.
More than 900 parents and children — including babies — have been separated since the court granted a nationwide injunction over a year ago, according to the ACLU.
The Trump administration has been forcibly removing migrant children from their parents since last year as part of Trump’s Draconian immigration policies.

“It is shocking that the Trump administration continues to take babies from their parents,” Lee Gelernt, lead attorney in the family separation lawsuit and deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said. “Over 900 more families join the thousands of others previously torn apart by this cruel and illegal policy. The administration must not be allowed to circumvent the court order over infractions like minor traffic violations.”
The motion was filed in U.S. District Court in San Diego.

280,Rep. Khanna: Attack on Cummings Will Hurt Trump in Suburban Counties He Needs to Carry,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/rep-khanna-attack-on-cummings-will-hurt-trump-in-suburban-counties-he-needs-to-carry/,"If Donald Trump thought his Twitter attack against Rep. Elijah Cummings will help him politically, he is wrong, according to a California Democrat. More than that, Trump’s attack against Cummings and his Baltimore district is a mistake because the Maryland Democrat counts some of Trump’s GOP friends among his own supporters, added two-term Rep. Ro Khanna.
Trump started his tweetstorm against Cummings this last weekend, calling the lawmaker’s Baltimore-centered district “infested.” It was just one in a string of racist attacks against non-white Democratic figures.
The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Cummings is leading a number of investigations of Trump, his business, campaigns and administration.

The attack against Cummings will hurt Trump politically in his own bid for re-election, said Khanna.
“It’s going to hurt him particularly in suburban counties that he needs to carry. And it’s sad because he is going at gut instinct. He thinks that dividing this country is what is going to be in his interest, but he’s miscalculating,” Khanna said. “But notice Chairman Cummings’ response. He didn’t respond in kind, he didn’t attack the president. He actually said he’s still open to working with the president on lowering the cost of prescription drugs. And my view is that people are going to respond to Chairman Cummings because he’s talking about solving the issues that people care about as opposed to going back and forth on Twitter.”
Moreover, Cummings is close to such House conservatives as Reps. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).
“Mark Meadows has a close friendship with Chairman Cummings. He has always been decent in speaking with Chairman Cummings, and Chairman Cummings, as you pointed out, has come to his defense,” Khanna told MSNBC host Steve Kornacki. “President Trump picked the wrong person in going after Elijah Cummings. Elijah Cummings, the son of a sharecropper, has faced so much, overcome so much discrimination, is seen as a moral voice.
“And even Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows, the president’s closest allies, speak with respect of this chairman,” Khanna added. “So it was just the wrong target. That’s why I think it’s going to backfire.”

281,Judiciary Dem: ‘We Are in an Impeachment Investigation’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/judiciary-dem-we-are-in-an-impeachment-investigation/,"While hundreds of House Democrats and much of official Washington is busy debating whether to open an impeachment proceeding against Donald Trump, one top member of the House Judiciary Committee says impeachment has functionally already begun.
“A lot of people believe we’ve been in an impeachment inquiry ever since we started looking into potential high crimes and misdemeanors and the misconduct of the executive branch, other people think impeachment inquiry doesn’t begin until you actually have articles of impeachment,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a former constitutional law professor. “I would say we are an impeachment investigation, and as to the results of the investigation it could lead to articles of impeachment or it could lead to something else, but for from my personal standpoint I think we are in an impeachment investigation.”

More than 100 House Democrats (as well as independent Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan) support impeaching Trump.
Many Democrats had hoped that last week’s televised testimony of former special counsel Robert Mueller before Congress might have moved public opinion toward formal impeachment of Trump on obstruction of justice. But that doesn’t seem to have occurred.

282,Asylum-Seekers Who Followed Trump Rule Now Don’t Qualify Because of New Trump Rule,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/asylum-seekers-who-followed-trump-rule-now-dont-qualify-because-of-new-trump-rule/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
The Trump administration has long said that there’s a right way to seek asylum in the United States: Come to an official port of entry at the border, then invoke the right under U.S. law to humanitarian protection.
But now, thousands of people are being barred from the U.S. precisely because they followed those rules.
Under an administration policy issued last week, most migrants who’ve passed through a third country — say, Mexico — will not even be allowed to request asylum at official border crossings.
That includes thousands of asylum-seekers — from countries like Cuba, Venezuela and Cameroon — who were already waiting at Mexican border towns to gain entry to U.S. ports when the new rule took effect.
Because the Trump administration has strictly limited the number of asylum-seekers allowed to enter most of the US/Mexico border’s busiest ports each day, these migrants signed on to unofficial waitlists and spent months waiting to gain legal entry to the U.S. as asylum-seekers.


One little-noticed consequence of the new policy is that those who decided against entering the US illegally are now paying a price for having followed the rules. Had they simply crossed into the U.S. illegally when they arrived, they would have had their asylum claims heard under the rules in place at that time. But by choosing to wait to set foot on US soil and trigger their asylum rights, they’ll now be subjected to the new regulation once they do enter — a rule which renders most of them ineligible.
The administration made them wait. Indeed, in recent weeks, it admitted fewer asylum-seekers than ever at the border’s busiest crossing in San Ysidro, California: In nine out of the 14 days before the new rule was implemented, no asylum-seekers were allowed to enter the port of entry at all, according to Ryan Krause, a human rights observer with the advocacy organization Al Otro Lado.
Then, with the new regulation, it put up a wall in front of any non-Mexican asylum-seeker who waited.
The new regulation is already facing court challenges, with federal hearings this week in Washington, D.C., and the Northern District of California. Advocates say it will result in victims of persecution being deported to their home countries, in violation of international law. The Trump administration claims it comports with international law by allowing migrants to seek a lesser form of humanitarian protection called “withholding of removal,” which is harder to qualify for, even if they’re barred from asylum.
Even the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Mark Morgan, has said the Trump administration expects a federal judge to stay the regulation while it undergoes legal review.
But on the Mexican side of the border, it’s already having real-world effects — ramping up the frustration that migrants stuck in border towns already had, advocates say, and potentially increasing the odds that migrants who’ve been patiently waiting will simply give up and cross the border illegally.
Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for comment about the inclusion of migrants waiting at ports of entry in the new regulation, or to questions about why port officials accepted fewer asylum-seekers than usual in the weeks leading up to the overnight rule change.
“I understand their frustration,” Enrique Valenzuela, of the State Population Council in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, told ProPublica. “People who have been waiting for two or three months say: ‘Hey! We’ve been waiting here! We didn’t cross at some other point. We’re not getting the best end of the deal.’”
The migrants who agreed to wait are those most likely to trust the system and care about doing things through established legal channels. “People are like, ‘I’m here, I’m doing it legally, I have faith that it’s going to get better, all I can do is wait,’” Krause said. “You travel from Africa through 10 countries, through the jungles of Panama, many people got robbed or their friends were killed along the way, people narrowly escaped death themselves — they’ve been through horrible travails and incredibly arduous journey, people aren’t going to be easily shaken by this process here.”
But the new rule is just the latest development to wear away at that resolve.
Limits on how many asylum-seekers may enter a port of entry each day — a practice known as metering — have been widespread at many border ports since at least 2018, especially at the high-traffic ones in El Paso, Texas, and San Ysidro.
Customs and Border Protection, which oversees ports of entry, maintains that ports simply lack the resources to process all asylum-seekers who want to enter at once; each port has a limited number of holding cells, for example. Capacity varies substantially from port to port, and from day to day, and officers have to balance their duty to process asylum-seekers with other tasks, like screening vehicles for drugs.


Many human rights advocates say that regardless, the government has an obligation to allow people to seek asylum. Groups led by Al Otro Lado have filed a lawsuit in Southern California challenging metering. It hasn’t moved as quickly as higher-profile immigration policy lawsuits.
The U.S. government doesn’t select who is allowed to cross on a given day; officials simply give a number to their Mexican counterparts of how many people will be allowed to set foot on U.S. soil. Mexican authorities, civil society organizations and asylum-seekers themselves take care of the rest. In Juárez, for example, the list managed by the State Population Council currently has about 5,500 names.
While the longest lists are in Juárez (across from El Paso) and Tijuana (across from San Diego and the San Ysidro port), hundreds-long waiting lists exist even in small border towns across from minor ports. In the shelters of Piedras Negras across from Eagle Pass, Texas, for example, some 400 migrants are currently waiting to be allowed to cross.
Some of these migrants are Mexican. But many are from other countries and therefore subject to the new bar to asylum.
In the six days after the new regulation took effect, Krause said that roughly 30 to 40 non-Mexican migrants were admitted to the port of entry at San Ysidro — from countries including Cameroon, Haiti, Eritrea and Venezuela, as well as the Northern Triangle nations of Central America (Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador). All of them arrived in Tijuana by the first week of April, and signed up for the waitlist between April 2 and 6.
Any of them could have crossed before July 16 if the port officials at San Ysidro had admitted them when they arrived — or even if they had maintained the pace of admissions from spring 2019, when an average of 40 people were admitted per day, through this summer.
But instead, in mid-June, admissions dropped off drastically. Between July 1 and July 15, an average of six asylum-seekers were admitted per day, Krause said.
And so, when numbers picked up again last week, the migrants admitted — at least the non-Mexicans — were subject to the new regulation.
The waitlists are not recognized by the U.S. government, and no one who has signed them has any protection as asylum-seekers. The lists are simply an effort, often started by asylum-seekers themselves (but now managed in some places by other institutions, like the State Population Council in Juárez) to bring some order to the process.
Meanwhile, ports now have an added demand on their limited resources — sending asylum-seekers back to Mexico after their initial processing to await court hearings, under the Trump administration program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP.
Twenty thousand asylum-seekers have been sent to wait in Mexico under MPP since it was first instituted in January — most of them in the last few months, as the program has aggressively expanded. Their asylum claims are moving forward in U.S. immigration courts, but the asylum-seekers themselves are only allowed into the U.S. to attend those hearings. They show up at a port of entry on the day of their hearing, are escorted into the U.S. and then returned after the hearing with instructions to come back on the next court date.
A Department of Justice spokesperson confirmed to ProPublica that asylum-seekers who had first entered the U.S. before July 16 wouldn’t be subject to the new asylum rule, even if they were in Mexico when the regulation went into effect under MPP.
The exact same space and personnel that would be used to process new asylum-seekers are now being used to ship people with existing asylum cases back and forth each day. “They’ve chosen to use CBP’s limited capacity to process people for return,” Kennji Kizuka, of Human Rights First, said.
Many migrants choose not to wait; in Juarez, Valenzuela of the State Population Council said, an estimated 1,000 of the 5,500 people currently on the waitlist have probably already crossed illegally into the U.S.
There are compelling reasons to try to cross at a port — for one thing, the administration still hopes to reinstate a regulation issued in October that would bar asylum for those who crossed illegally. That regulation was put on hold by the courts days after it was issued, and an appeal will be heard in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the fall.


But the slowing trickle of admissions (especially in Tijuana) in the weeks before the new rule, followed by the overnight change that rendered so many asylum-seekers retroactively ineligible, have led to confusion, frustration and even despondency, according to Krause.
Some “are in some way evaluating the possibility of crossing before it gets hard to do so,” Valenzuela said. “I ask them every time to be patient, to keep calm, but it’s hard to convince them when they’ve been waiting for two or three months.”
Organizers find themselves in the position of counseling patience to migrants who post angry video rants on social media, or who come to them trying to understand rumors of forthcoming changes to the law that will make it even harder to enter the U.S. — changes like the one issued last week.
“People have lost faith in the system, trust in the process,” Krause said of the migrants waiting in Tijuana. Lately, he added, he’s hearing a lot more questions about what the laws are like in Canada.

283,"Jennifer Granholm to Mia Love: More Republicans Like You Should Come out and Tell Trump, ‘Enough Is Enough’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/jennifer-granholm-to-mia-love-more-republicans-like-you-should-come-out-and-tell-trump-enough-is-enough/,"The first black female Republican elected to Congress took Donald Trump to task for his ongoing string of racist tweets attacking non-white Democratic figures.
“Look, the blame game has been going on for years but in the recent Tweets and the things that I have seen, enough is enough. It really is disheartening,” said former Rep. Mia Love of Utah, who served two terms before being narrowly defeated last year. “The greatest threat that we face is the division of America and I don’t believe that any president should be playing a part in dividing America.
“I actually say this not just as a former representative, I’m saying this as a Republican and a mother. I think this is exactly what the Russians want. I think it is exactly what our enemies want,” added Love, whose family came to the United States as refugees from Haiti. “To see Americans tear each other up and the president has gone way too far. Anything less than an apology is unacceptable to me.”

Trump first tweeted racist attacks against four non-white Democratic congresswomen, telling them to “go back” to the countries they came from. Then just this last weekend, Trump tweeted an attack against Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md) and Cummings’ Baltimore district. Cummings, an African American, is the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, where he oversees several investigations of Trump.
Love made her remarks on-air on CNN.
In response, Democratic former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm replied, “Can I just say thank you? Thank you for being a Republican who has stood up. We need more people like you saying, ‘Enough is enough.’ We are not a country that craves that division. He is not going to profit electorally but using division as a way of getting to the office again. I think it is going to backfire and I really appreciate you saying that.”

284,‘He’s Just a Racist Who Uses Social Media’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/hes-just-a-racist-who-uses-social-media/,"With his attacks on Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Cummings Baltimore district, Donald Trump is merely doubling down on his public racism.
Trump launched a Twitter attack against Cummings, calling his district “infested.” Cummings is African American.
The chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Cummings is leading several investigations of Trump, his business and administration.
Trump’s attack against Cummings comes right on the heels of a racist attack against four non-white Democratic congresswomen.

Although Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif) is another tough opponent of Trump’s, Fox News host Chris Wallace said Trump wouldn’t use the same “infested” language to attack Schiff, who is white.
“This is just who Donald Trump is. He’s just an old racist. This is how he talks about people. This is how he thinks about people,” said journalist Linette Lopez with Business Insider. “This is not a grand strategy. He’s not playing chess. He’s just a racist who uses social media.”
Trump has no agenda other than a hate agenda, according to Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich), one of the congresswomen recently the target of Trump’s racist tweets.
“The president has a hate agenda. Right now as people are in my district every single day, I talk to folks that are losing their jobs, not getting paid what they need. They’re literally working three or four jobs just to make ends meet,” Tlaib said. “So many folks at the front line are really suffering and they want somebody that’s going to follow through on reducing prescription drugs.
“But this hate agenda is now seeping into policy making. You see the deregulation in EPA and you hear from residents in down river and even in southwest Detroit, we have a right to breathe clean air,” Tlaib added. “There is something going on here. We don’t feel like our government is protecting us. And it’s because the corporation is seeping in. This is a crooked CEO in the White House that is making decisions based on profits and his friends and his for-profit industry would benefit from versus what is best for the American people. We’re not going to get played in the 13th congressional district. We can see from far away that he’s incompetent and he hasn’t followed through on the promises he made.”

285,‘This Could Be the Last Free and Fair Election in American History’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/this-could-be-the-last-free-and-fair-election-in-american-history/,"With Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans unwilling to bring election security legislation to a vote, American democracy is at risk, according to independent experts.
McConnell (R-Ky) has indicated that he is unwilling to bring legislation to the Senate floor which would harden US election systems from the kinds of interference which former special counsel Robert Mueller warned about just last week in testimony before two House committees.
“It wasn’t a single attempt. They’re doing it as we sit here,” Mueller said of the Russians. “And they expect to do it during the next campaign.”

CNN political analyst John Avlon questioned how Senate Republicans blocking election security legislation meets US interests.
“That fact that a hostile foreign power attacked us and is continuing to attack us is something that should unite us all regardless of party. But it doesn’t. In fact, under President Trump it’s tended to have the opposite effect,” Avlon said. “And it’s outrageous that at the same time Mueller was issuing that warning, a Republican senator from Mississippi named Cindy Hyde-Smith was single-handedly blocking two election security bills.
“The Democrats tried to pass it by unanimous consent. Hyde-Smith objected. She didn’t even feel she needed a reason to do it,” Avlon added. “But what made her action even more insulting is that it came one day after FBI Director [Christopher] Wray told the Senate this.”
If the Russians can interfere in US elections with impunity, Americans will see other nations, including Iran, do likewise, according to national security expert and author Malcolm Nance.
“I am not joking when I say this could be the last free and fair election in American history,” Nance said. “It may not be a free and fair election. Look, even players like Iran who have also a good cyber warfare capability, they have an initiative, an interest to make this election be filled with as much chaos as possible, if only to punish Donald Trump.
“So we should see that all sorts of foreign actors and cyber actors and humans, human intelligence agents as we saw Russia bring into the United States before, it is in their interest to create not just chaos, but to bring the United States to the point where its system of government, this constitutional republic no longer functions for the American people,” Nance added.

286,"Maybe The Fault Lies With Us, Not Mueller",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/maybe-the-fault-lies-with-us-not-mueller/,"Honestly, former special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony before Congress was about what I expected. We knew Mueller wasn’t going to spell out exactly what he thought, unvarnished and for all to see. We knew he’d hedge his bets and refer back to his report to do the talking for him.
That observed…man, you can tell that we’re not holding presidents to the same standards as we used to. Mueller said enough to finish any other president. He made it clear that he would have indicted the president but for the Justice Department’s policy (which, by itself, coming from a prosecutor of Mueller’s record, is pretty damning), and he reasserted that President Trump actively knew about and expected to benefit from Russian interference in the election. Any other president, that’d be the end of it.

I admit, it’s frustrating that Mueller didn’t go further, but I get why he didn’t. End of the day, he’s trying not to get involved in partisan politics — if he’s anything like the rest of us, he’s tired of the back-and-forth, and he’s tired of impartial systems being used for partisan gain. Hell, even I’ll say that’s what last week’s hearing was for — but it’s partisan only because one party is trying to protect the United States, and the other is trying to protect its grip on the presidency.
Those who were expecting something more damning will be disappointed, but honestly, Mueller said enough there to end Trump’s presidency, were we dealing with a Congress that actually cared about the integrity of the United States. Instead, the GOP will take it as a sign that nothing said there was sufficiently revelatory for them to change position and condemn their own president. They’ll keep spinning the “Witch Hunt” narrative and dismiss the contents of the report, and leave the voters to dismiss it accordingly.
It also places the Democrats in a bad position — they should impeach Trump on the back of this testimony, but they know it wasn’t sufficient to get the Republicans to budge, so now that action will be taken as a partisan political attack rather than for what it is — an act taken by the people’s representatives to protect the United States from a corrupt and likely criminal president.
In other words, nothing’s really changed.

287,How Fundraisers Convinced Conservatives to Donate $10 Million — Then Kept Almost All of It.,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/how-fundraisers-convinced-conservatives-to-donate-10-million-then-kept-almost-all-of-it/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
After recruiting thousands of donors for the American Conservative Union — the powerful organization behind the annual CPAC conference — a Republican political operative pushed the same contributors to give millions to a PAC that promised to go after then-President Barack Obama, but then steered much of their donations to himself and his partners.
The PAC, called the Conservative Majority Fund, has raised nearly $10 million since mid-2012 and continues to solicit funds to this day, primarily from thousands of steadfast contributors to conservative causes, many of them senior citizens. But it has made just $48,400 in political contributions to candidates and committees. Public records indicate its main beneficiaries are the operative Kelley Rogers, who has a history of disputes over allegedly unethical fundraising, and one of the largest conservative fundraising companies, InfoCision Management Corp., which charged millions of dollars in fundraising fees.
The saga of how politically connected fundraisers used one of the nation’s leading conservative organizations as a springboard for fundraising that mainly benefited the fundraisers themselves sheds light on the growing problem of so-called scam PACs — organizations that take advantage of loosened campaign finance laws to reap windfalls for insiders while directing only a small portion of receipts to actual political advocacy.


Watchdogs have long complained that ethics laws fail to prevent the exploitation of donors by organizations operating with little or no oversight, and even President Donald Trump’s campaign issued a warning this year about “dishonest fundraising groups” using the president’s name to raise funds.
Rogers’ and InfoCision’s work on behalf of the ACU also shows how lax regulation allows big-name political organizations to recruit donors without identifying either the source of the calls or the ultimate beneficiaries of the donations. ACU appears to have had little control over the PAC’s operation and was not the source of its fundraising scripts.
“The individuals — or many of the individuals — who seem to be profiting off of scam PACs are the same people who also provide services to mainstream players,” said Adav Noti, a lawyer who worked for more than 10 years at the Federal Election Commission. “Obviously not every political consultant is fleecing small donors. But the consultants who are fleecing small donors, largely the way they’re able to do that is because they have experience and connections.”
Rogers and InfoCision did not respond to repeated requests for interviews — including lists of detailed questions. But the extent of their operation is detailed in a series of emails and documents obtained by ProPublica and Politico from a person with direct knowledge. In the records, Rogers and his cohorts discuss how to contour their pitches to collect the most money, betting that the most red-meat appeals would draw the most dollars.
“This makes me a little queasy … which is good,” Rogers wrote after reviewing a script for a fundraising call that questioned Obama’s citizenship. “This is approved.”
The emails raise questions about Rogers’ work ostensibly on behalf of the ACU, which burst to fame in the 1970s and calls its conference “the birthplace of modern conservatism” for its role in elevating Ronald Reagan. The CPAC conference, most recently held at National Harbor, Maryland, is widely considered a crucial point of connection between GOP leadership and the grassroots activists who whip up excitement for the party’s agenda.
In 2010, the ACU enlisted Rogers to find new donors for the organization. To do so, Rogers formed a political nonprofit called the New Conservative Coalition and began soliciting money. It raised nearly $3.4 million between 2010 and mid-2012, although none of that money went to the ACU, IRS filings and records from Colorado show, because prospecting for new donors routinely consumes most or all of the money brought in.
By early 2012, the group appears to have test-marketed pitches to donors that were too extreme or embarrassing to be associated with the ACU itself. The emails reflect the insistence of then-ACU Chairman Al Cardenas, the veteran conservative lobbyist, and others in the organization that no trace of the ACU’s fingerprints be visible in the scripts given to telemarketers.


“Kelley just left me a voicemail that ACU has received a few calls in their office from people who ACU thought had received a [fundraising] call … [and] been directed to the ACU’s conservative.org website (and then called the ACU office.),” wrote one of Rogers’s colleagues. “… it may be nothing … but would you double check to make sure their [sic] in NO reference to ACU, conservative.org or Al Cardenas in any script, including the thank you call script?”
After finding references to ACU affiliates in some of the scripts, an operative asked, “I’m assuming we need ALL ACU references removed — is that right?”
“Yes … just get rid of all of them,” responded another.
At another point, Rogers’ colleagues expressed concern about Cardenas’ Hispanic heritage and the tenor of their anti-immigration message to donors. The script, drafted in January 2012, declared that undocumented immigrants “account for a large percentage of our crime — and prison costs … and take jobs away from Americans.” Those claims are not supported by evidence.
“Cardenas, the ACU Chairman, is Hispanic,” the consultant working with Rogers wrote. “In an effort to keep this script under the radar I think we should re-name it ‘Obama’s Plan.’”
In an interview, Cardenas said he didn’t recall any disagreements between ACU and InfoCision. He said ACU had been careful to run the fundraising project by its lawyers.
“The only thing I remember is making sure our executive director thought it was a good idea” to seek out new donors, Cardenas said. “Probably, the consultants got upset with the parameters that our legal counsel set.”
Asked why ACU would shield its identity when pitching donors, Cardenas said, “Using our name and my name is something we wouldn’t want to happen because a) it would hurt our own fundraising purposes, and b) we have very little control over content and we didn’t want our reputation to be tainted in any way — but I’m only guessing.”
The ACU executive director at the time, Gregg Keller, declined to comment. The ACU and current director Matt Schlapp did not respond to repeated requests for comment, including an emailed list of specific questions concerning the organization’s dealings with Rogers and InfoCision.


By the end of the summer of 2012, Rogers and InfoCision had broken with the ACU and created a new federal PAC, the Conservative Majority Fund. It began raising money using the New Conservative Coalition donor list and aggressive fundraising tactics, which painted Obama as a shady figure whose real name was “Barry Soetoro” and who “had long-term relationships with terrorists,” according to scripts for calls circulated among people working on the fundraising campaign. Neither claim is accurate. The PAC said it was hiring investigators to press the case that Obama was ineligible to be president.
That message struck gold: $2.8 million poured in from more than 30,000 donors during the five months between July and December of that year alone. To kick off its campaign, the PAC paid $371,000 in August 2012 for a television ad that briefly aired on cable television and urged viewers to call the PAC, where they would be solicited for donations. After August, it ran no television ads and made no expenditures for anything other than fundraising.
FEC records show almost all the money went for calls to donors like Mike Miller, a jeweler in Barrington, Illinois, who gave $500.
“At the time they called, it seemed like such an important thing,” Miller said in a phone interview. “I was assuming they were legitimate.” When told about the group’s lack of spending on disqualifying Obama from the ballot, he said, “If they did this, and didn’t use it for intended purposes, I want my money back.”
On the day after Obama won reelection, the PAC changed its call scripts, telling donors that Obama’s “immediate plans are to pardon the terrorists at Guantanamo, give full amnesty to illegal aliens and give the United Nations the authority to tax Americans,” according to a fundraising script in the emails. There is no evidence that any of those plans were under consideration by the Obama administration. Donors were told that the PAC had hired a team of investigators and lawyers to press for impeachment. There is no evidence in FEC records that it ever did.
The fundraising scripts included suggested responses if the prospective donors said they were unemployed, on a fixed income or had significant medical bills to pay, encouraging them to give a smaller amount. When recipients asked not to be called again, the script instructed the telemarketers to offer to place them on a “restricted list” so that they would not get more than one call every 30 days. If recipients insisted, they would be added to a no-call list.
Rogers has previously come under harsh scrutiny for raising large amounts of money but spending little on the promised advocacy. Former Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli sued Rogers for his involvement in a PAC that raised money purportedly to support Cuccinelli’s bid to be governor in 2013 but did not spend any to help Cuccinelli win. The case was settled in 2015. In 2017, Rogers’ Maryland office was raided by the FBI, but no charges were brought.
Election integrity experts have warned that alleged scam PACs are siphoning tens of millions of dollars in political donations into the coffers of fundraisers each year, while misleading donors.


Lynne Archer, 72, gave the Conservative Majority Fund $3,800 between 2012 and 2018. Archer said she tries to be wary of potential scams, but the Conservative Majority Fund had always sounded “like a legitimate group” when it solicited money.
“Damn, I gave a lot to them,” said Archer, who lives in Sugar Land, Texas, and works for her husband at an automobile dealership. “I don’t like that at all.”
Noti, who used to work at the FEC, called the proliferation of scam PACs “incredibly corrosive to American democracy” because of the impact on donors like Archer — many of them elderly — who give money in good faith to political causes.
“It’s going to chase people out of the system once those donors realize their money’s been stolen,” Noti said. “They’re going to be disillusioned and disenchanted, and rightfully so.”
Both Rogers’ Annapolis, Maryland-based Strategic Campaign Group and the Akron, Ohio-based InfoCision, a direct marketing firm, were once staples of GOP fundraising. Rogers’ clients included Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran and National Security Adviser John Bolton, while InfoCision helped raise money for the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Rifle Association.
When the ACU sought to expand its roster of donors, it contracted with Rogers and InfoCision to make calls to a large number of potential contributors — a time-consuming, and therefore expensive, process known as “prospecting.”
During the spring and summer of 2012, several employees who worked in the political division at InfoCision, along with Rogers and other consultants, began using increasingly aggressive fundraising tactics for ACU — though the organization was never supposed to be named in fundraising materials or scripts.
The scripts tapped into voter concerns about illegal immigration. One, in the midst of the 2012 presidential campaign, declared that there was a “huge scandal” that the group had “recently uncovered,” in which Obama was “now planning to deliberately target 20-million poor Latino immigrants — a desperate effort to win re-election,” according to the emails.
Those pitches led to a flurry of emails discussing the nature of the appeals — and whether they might alienate Cardenas. Rogers was the main conduit for complaints, often relaying concerns from ACU leaders to the fundraisers crafting the various appeals.
Several months later Rogers proposed something else entirely: He and InfoCision would take the lists of donors they had harvested while working with ACU, split off their own fundraising operation, then open it as a PAC and raise money without ACU as a client.
“It’s becoming very apparent to me for many reasons that we are going to have to de-affiliate” the fundraising with ACU, Rogers wrote. “I am still trying to resolve issues with them but I can tell we are headed for trouble.”
Tensions between the ACU and the people operating the donor recruitment operation continued, emails among InfoCision employees indicate, because the PAC’s early fundraising pleas sometimes included references to ACU despite ACU’s wishes that they didn’t.
“We now have to eliminate ALL ACU references” in the materials for the group, wrote Erik Byers, an account executive who helped oversee the work done on behalf of ACU, to his colleagues on June 29, 2012. “Kelley got blasted by ACU.”
Soon after, in early July, Rogers and a handful of other individuals established the Conservative Majority Fund and began raising money.


Because InfoCision telemarketers (called “Communicators”) might recognize that they were reusing fundraising appeals, a company manager stressed the importance of a separate identity.
“We’re starting a new, independent PAC, with an established donor base,” Matthew Birkbeck, then a marketing executive at InfoCision, wrote. “It’s exciting, so sell it! We can’t have the Communicators talking about ACU. There are threats of lawsuits surrounding this!!!”
Calls and emails to Birkbeck were not returned.
By mid-August, Rogers wrote to the ACU that the fundraising operation with them “is completely shut down in all fronts.”
In the months that followed, the InfoCision managers created increasingly provocative call scripts focused on voter fraud, Obama’s (false) country of birth and — after his reelection — launching an impeachment drive to remove him from office.
In addition to Rogers, the InfoCision account manager Byers, a consultant and two other InfoCision employees, including Birkbeck, were involved with the Conservative Majority Fund, according to the emails. All of those people had also been involved with the previous work with the ACU, and the group worked quickly to close accounts and reassign paperwork to the new organization.
Scott B. Mackenzie, a Republican bookkeeper who serves as the treasurer for dozens of political committees, was treasurer of the group, responsible for filing its reports with the FEC.
Mackenzie did not respond to a request for comment. Byers, of InfoCision, did not respond to requests for comment.
The PAC’s executive director was Dennis Whitfield, a former deputy labor secretary during the Reagan administration. Whitfield worked as a consultant for ACU in 2012, according to the group’s website. He also worked with Rogers at Strategic Campaign Group. Whitfield’s name was used to help promote the Conservative Majority Fund, for example on an October 2012 letter about voter fraud that cautioned: “I mean, imagine how you’ll feel if Obama wins because of all this? We’re scared to death!”
Phone calls to Whitfield were not returned.
The InfoCision staff and Rogers got their first look at a fundraising script and a television ad for the new Conservative Majority Fund on July 5, just two weeks after Rogers floated the idea for opening the PAC. They described an effort to remove Obama from the ballot and raised questions about his eligibility to be president.


“We need to gather 10,000 signatures from each congressional district to have him removed from the ballot,” one script read, before callers asked people for donations. The procedure for removing candidates from the ballot varies by state, but does not require the specific goal claimed by the script. If the donor gave money using a credit card, the caller was instructed to try to upsell them: “I want to let you know that we’re developing some new TV ads about Obama’s past that are going to shock people. We need to get the ads on the air quickly, so can we count on you for an additional gift[?]”
Rogers approved both pitches, according to the emails.
Using the ACU donors and lists of conservative donors pulled from InfoCision’s collection or purchased from other vendors, the new group raked in large amounts of money: Between 2012 and 2018, the Conservative Majority Fund disclosed raising more than $9.6 million, almost entirely from small-dollar donors. At least $9 million of that has been paid to InfoCision for expenses reported as fundraising costs. Strategic Campaign Group, where Rogers works, received an additional $229,000, while Mackenzie was paid $172,000 as the PAC’s treasurer.
In its reporting to the FEC, the Conservative Majority Fund disclosed spending $5.3 million on what it described as expressly political expenditures, but nearly all of it was on fundraising calls — placed by InfoCision — that criticized Democratic politicians, particularly Obama and Hillary Clinton. The Conservative Majority Fund produced two TV ads, but it appears to have spent little money airing them. Most of its recent activity has been phone calls and social media posts supportive of Trump, whose image figures prominently on the PAC’s website.
There’s no further evidence in records that the Conservative Majority Fund was active in the 2012 elections. Nonetheless, the group bragged in various solicitations to donors that it was taking on a range of anti-Obama organizing, which included: employing a “Truth Squad” to lobby states to remove Obama from the ballot; “hiring undercover researchers” to expose attempts by the Obama campaign to commit voter fraud; and putting “media specialists” on television and radio shows, as well as authoring newspaper and magazine articles and social media posts, “giving regular updates on Obama’s dirty tricks.”
ProPublica and Politico did not find any record of experts from the Conservative Majority Fund appearing on television or radio to discuss the election and could find no evidence from the states cited by the group — Alabama, Tennessee, Arizona and Illinois — indicating it lobbied to remove Obama from the ballot. And the Conservative Majority Fund could not have worked in states to stop “phony [voter] registrations,” which an October 2012 letter to donors said it would do. By then, the voter rolls were closed in many states and could not be changed by anyone.
Starting the day after Obama was reelected, employees at InfoCision began circulating plans for a new message for callers: a case for impeaching the president.
“Impeachment is our only option,” said a recording that InfoCision planned to play to potential donors, according to emails circulated among the operatives on Nov. 7, 2012. “And Republicans are already considering Obama investigations. As the nation’s most effective conservative group … We are launching the official ‘IMPEACH OBAMA’ campaign.”
At least from a fundraising perspective, the campaign was a success: In the first six months of 2013, FEC records show, the PAC raised an additional $1.7 million.
At least since 2015, federal regulators have been aware of complaints about the tactics used by the Conservative Majority Fund, as well as other PACs linked to Rogers and Mackenzie, the PAC’s treasurer. But the Conservative Majority Fund continued to operate with relatively little attention from authorities, a reflection of how federal laws do little to protect the public from potential scam PACs, according to watchdogs.
The FEC has twice probed the Conservative Majority Fund’s activities — but the commission, despite being the main federal regulator, is limited in what it can do. In July 2016, the FEC found the Conservative Majority Fund had misreported items on its federal disclosures during the 2013-14 election cycle. It paid a $3,500 fine. In October 2017, the FEC approved an audit covering the last six months of 2012 that found the Conservative Majority Fund had misstated its financial activity.
Both inquiries only skimmed the surface, looking at financial forms submitted to the commission.
The commission rarely chooses to launch full investigations — which allow it to ask questions, interview employees and demand documents from a group — without first having evidence of wrongdoing.
There are also holes in federal law that make it difficult for the commission to exercise meaningful oversight of groups like the Conservative Majority Fund. While the law prohibits raising campaign money while fraudulently “acting for or on behalf of any candidate or political party,” it does little to address a PAC like the Conservative Majority Fund that didn’t do this. The bar for federal law enforcement in proving a broader criminal statute like wire fraud is far higher. Last year, prosecutors in the Southern District of New York for the first time indicted two men for wire fraud who ran PACs that raised money in the name of causes such as autism awareness and helping police.
In a 2016 memo on the issue, two FEC commissioners implored their colleagues to take action against scam PACs but acknowledged that federal law gives political committees “great leeway on how they use the funds” they raise.
“The power of the Commission to directly and comprehensively protect political contributors is limited,” the two commissioners concluded.
In late 2018, the FEC formally asked Congress to take action against “fraudulent PAC practices” by some PACs. “These committees solicit contributions with promises of supporting candidates, but then disclose minimal or no candidate support activities while engaging in significant and continuous fundraising, which predominantly funds personal compensation for the committees’ organizers,” the commission wrote.
When Cuccinelli, the former Virginia attorney general and gubernatorial candidate, sued Rogers and a PAC called Conservative StrikeForce, he said they’d used Cuccinelli’s name to raise more than $2 million, but donated just $10,000 to Cuccinelli’s campaign.
Cuccinelli settled with Rogers and Conservative StrikeForce in May 2015 for $85,000. Cuccinelli’s spokesperson did not respond to an interview request.
In 2017, the FBI raided the Annapolis office of Rogers’ consulting firm. At the time, Rogers said the FBI appeared interested in work his firm did in the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial race, but the FBI did not shed any light on its actions. The pre-dawn raid was a near-unheard of occurence in the political sphere, but it didn’t result in charges being brought against Rogers or the PAC. Rogers’ firm shut down its website and closed the office in Annapolis.
InfoCision, meanwhile, paid a $250,000 settlement in 2018 for “deceptive charitable solicitation calls” in an unrelated case. InfoCision callers initially told potential donors they were not calling to solicit donations when that was not the case, according to the Federal Trade Commission. But the FTC does not have similar jurisdiction over political fundraising, highlighting that business solicitations are more highly regulated than political fundraising.


Election law experts have proposed changes that would discourage scam PACs by broadening anti-fraud provisions in federal election law or enacting an anti-self-dealing provision that prohibits PAC operators from turning an excessive profit. Smaller changes, such as expanding the requirements for PACs to disclose more information to donors who visit their websites, could also help curb the number of scam PACs operating in the political space.
“It seems that it would not be that hard and it should be something that is bipartisan, you would hope,” said Ann Ravel, former chair of the FEC.
The argument for enacting more regulation on scam PACs is “similar to why there’s oversight over nonprofits who take money from individuals in the name of good causes, and then use it to enrich themselves,” Ravel said. “It’s stealing.”

288,Pete Buttigieg Releases His New Economic Policy,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/pete-buttigieg-releases-his-new-economic-policy/,"Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg unveiled an economic program aimed at protecting workers, particularly the ability of workers to join labor unions.
Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., is one of about two dozen Democrats running for the Democratic presidential nomination.
“This plan is really aimed at protecting the American worker and really putting in the hot seat some of these bigger tech companies,” said CNN reporter Vanessa Yurkevich.

Some highlights Yurkevich reported from the plan include:
Guaranteeing all American workers have the right to join a union;
Introducing multimillion-dollar penalties for employers who interfere with workers’ rights.
And legislation that makes pay gaps at every large company public.
“He’s also calling out in this plan companies like Google, Lyft, and Uber for using contractors and not hiring full-time employees,” Yurkevich said. “Contractors like Lyft drivers, for example, don’t get those full-time benefits. And what he’s proposing is that these contracted workers can form unions, they can collective bargain, and he would make it so that every company would have to follow very strict guidelines in order to determine whether or not their employees are, in fact, contractors.
“I spoke to the mayor exclusively last night and he told me that he is willing to take on the big tech companies,” she added. “He said, quote, ‘I think they need to recognize the consequences if we continue moving into an economic reality where workers are eviscerated. I have nothing against these companies when workers are doing well, but they can’t have it both ways.’
“This policy is also incredibly pro-union, which is really interesting because we know President Trump did really well with unions and the mayor says that this plan is in part to try to get those labor unions back on the supportive side of Democrats,” Yurkevich said. “And he is hoping that this plan will really resonate with those union voters.”

289,The Death Penalty’s Fatal Flaw is Finding a Way to Do It Right,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-death-penaltys-fatal-flaw-is-finding-a-way-to-do-it-right/,"(EDITOR’S NOTE: Tony Panaccio, once a reporter for the now-defunct Clearwater Sun daily newspaper, is one of only a handful of journalists to witness the execution of serial killer Ted Bundy at the Florida State Prison 28 years ago this month.)
As the federal government is gearing up to start executing death row inmates, I found myself remembering my first, and incredibly surreal, experience with capital punishment.
It took place while I was covering the execution of Ted Bundy, and happened before I even set foot in Starke Prison.

I had asked the communications director of the prison, Bob MacMaster, for Bundy’s schedule for his last day before his execution. Keep in mind, this was back in 1989, so it’s not like the old newsroom at The Clearwater Sun had email access. MacMaster sent me the information via snail mail, and it didn’t come in a standard envelope. I was expecting a couple of sheets of paper, at most. Instead, I received a three-ring binder with more than 100 pages neatly tucked inside. 
What I did not understand at the time of my request was that every minute of a condemned man’s final day is accounted for in the Florida statute authorizing the death penalty itself. Everything from bathing, restroom breaks, and even the choices for his last meal — it was all in there, in plain black and white. 
Did you know if a death row inmate gets the flu the day before his execution, the state has to wait for him to feel better before they execute him? It’s apparently only cruel and unusual to kill an inmate if his sinuses are clogged. Also, we never execute anyone on a Sunday. That would be violating the sabbath. So, now there are two things you can’t do on a Sunday in Florida — execute someone and get a Chik-Fil-A sandwich. 

It struck me that some poor clerk or legislative aide had to sit down and write this up before the law was passed, and made me wonder just how many other persnickety details were codified by a law which had the sole purpose of guiding state employees on the right way to kill a human being.
In a larger sense, that’s the question the U.S. Supreme Court was attempting to address with its ruling last year that Florida’s existing capital punishment law is unconstitutional. It’s not that the idea of the state killing a criminal as part of a legal punishment was constitutionally ambiguous, but rather, in allowing judges too much unilateral sway during the process, that we just weren’t doing it right. So, it’s still okay for the government to kill people, as long as it’s done just so.

But there’s a broader theme in play beyond the constitutionality of capital punishment: the simple reality that there may not be any “right way” for the state to kill convicted criminals. Of course, the primary problem that states are beginning to discover — aside from simply trying to find a humane and dignified way to end the life of a capital criminal — is the one thing you cannot do with the death penalty: Undo it.
The Innocence Project has helped remove 20 death row residents since they began their work in 1992, winning release for an additional 316 innocent inmates wrongly convicted of crimes. Of course, those who served years behind bars cannot get that time back. That being said, wrongful convictions turn into lawsuits, which turn into cash settlements for those inmates to take as legal compensation for their incarceration. With the death penalty, there is no compensation that can undo or compensate for that sentence once it is wrongly carried out.

Moreover, the state suffers from the costliness of administering the death penalty, with a Palm Beach Post study from January 2000 estimating Florida could save $51 million each year if all death row inmates’ sentences were commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Incidentally, that’s the most recent study on the expense of death row. 
Perhaps that is why the Supreme Court, states around the country, the Democratic Party Platform Committee and the modern media machine are finding difficulty with the death penalty, as well. In fact, the only participant in this issue who seems completely committed to the death penalty is the federal government. I guess after putting brown children in cages, they wanted to test just how far the humanity bar could be lowered without actually touching the ground.

Our government was founded as an institution to safeguard the rights and privileges of our citizens, so it stands to reason that it probably shouldn’t be in the business of killing them. It can’t be undone, and it forces the state to spend more money on inmates it intends to kill than inmates it hopes to rehabilitate. Finally, if it’s illegal for people to kill, how can it become legal simply because the government — of the people, for the people, and by the people — chooses to do it?

290,"Trump Losing Support of His Women Voters, Focus Groups Say",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trump-losing-support-of-his-women-voters-focus-groups-say/,"In a a poor omen for his re-election, Donald Trump is hemorrhaging support from the women who voted for him in 2016.
That was among the findings from several focus groups held by the nonprofit Democracy Corps and teachers’ union American Federation of Teachers (AFT).

Two-thirds of the people in these focus groups had voted for Trump in 2016, but almost half now were open to voting for someone else in 2020. 

Trump’s combined focus on trade and immigration consolidated the men, but not the women. 
It wasn’t a discussion of Trump’s failures as president or even a full understanding of Democratic platforms that moved the needle. People were simply fed up with the president’s inability to work with others and his rhetoric which makes everything about himself, according to an announcement of the focus group results.
That includes efforts by Trump and other Republicans to label all Democrats as “socialists.”
That effort appears to be backfiring, at least among women who used to back Trump. These women see Trump calling “socialist” as needless name-calling.
“The women reacted particularly negtively and view Trump as mainly responsible for the division, which several called a ‘war,'” according to a memo Democracy Corps distributed to explain the focus group results.
Democracy Corps and AFT held their focus groups in early June with white working class voters outside metropolitan areas: in Bangor in Maine’s Second Congressional District; in Oak Creek, Wis.; and in rural communities in Clark County outside of Las Vegas, Nev. The participants were weak Republicans and independents, two-thirds of whom had voted for Trump in 2016.

291,Biden: Russia Will Pay a Price for Interfering in Our Elections,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/biden-russia-will-pay-a-price-for-interfering-in-our-elections/,"Reacting to former special counsel Robert Mueller’s disclosure Wednesday that Russian interference in US elections continue to this day, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden promised he would ensure Russia’s meddling would be met with consequences if he is elected next year.
In his all-day testimony before the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees, Mueller was clear that not only did Russia interfere in the 2016 presidential election, but that interference extends to today and would continue to the 2020 election.

“I promise you — one of the things I was deeply involved with as vice president, the president [Obama] gave me a lot of room and authority in terms of foreign policy and national security — I promise you they will pay a price for continuing this proposition,” Biden said Thursday.
The former vice president also used extremely harsh language to criticize incumbent president Donald Trump, for Trump’s suggestion that he would continue to consider foreign aid to help win the coming election.
“If, in fact, I find out anything at all that is going on in terms of trying to [indecipherable] the election, whether it’s helping me or not helping me, I will immediately go to the intelligence community and the FBI,” Biden said. “This president said he’d accept that information. It is outrageous, It is un-American and it’s close to treasonous.”

292,Pelosi Appears To Soften on Impeachment After Mueller Testimony,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/pelosi-appears-to-soften-on-impeachment-after-mueller-testimony/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has long resisted calls to begin impeachment of Donald Trump.
And while she remains unprepared to move forward immediately, Pelosi’s stance appears to have softened somewhat following Wednesday’s day-long testimony by former special counsel Robert Mueller.
Current considerations involving impeachment revolve more around action in the courts in terms of enforcing subpoenas on Trump officials than any political calculation, Pelosi told reporters she met with late Wednesday after Mueller had completed his testimony before the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees.
Mueller was questioned about both the aspects of Russian interference in US elections, and attempted obstruction of the Mueller probe.

“This isn’t endless, understand that,” she said. “But we have live cases in the courts.  We have some that are going forward that [Judiciary] Chairman [Jerrold] Nadler just mentioned. It isn’t endless, but with strength in our hand to get that information, remembering that Watergate was when they got the information and the tapes that broke the case. So, it wasn’t just about changing public opinion. That helped change public opinion.
“But it isn’t about me, it’s about our [Democratic] Caucus, it’s about our country,” Pelosi added. “As I say, there’s a cone of silence in the White House that is engaging in a massive cover up of obstruction of justice.”
Although it’s been widely understood that the Republican Senate’s reluctance to actually vote to remove Trump from office has been a driving factor in her decision to avoid impeachment, Pelosi said that is not the case.
“I have never long said that,” she said. “I have never long said that.
“If we have a case for impeachment that’s the place we will have to go,” Pelosi added. “The fact why I’d like it to be a strong case is because it’s based on the facts. The facts and the law, that’s what matters. Not politics, not partisanship, just patriotism. I don’t care, I mean I’d like the Senate to be responsible and honor their oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution, to see what a challenge this is to our national security. What the Russians are trying to do to our country. But the stronger our case is the worse the Senate will look for just letting the president off the hook.”

293,Warren Presses Pelosi on Impeachment: ‘Some Things Are Above Politics’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/warren-presses-pelosi-on-impeachment-some-things-are-above-politics/,"While former special counsel Robert Mueller was testifying Wednesday on Capitol Hill about his investigation into Donald Trump, Sen. Elizabeth Warren was hundreds of miles away. But, she also, in her own way was building a case for Trump’s impeachment.
Warren, one of the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, came out for impeachment shortly after the Justice Department released the redacted version of the Mueller Report detailing the two-year investigation.

While the number of rank-and-file Democrats endorsing impeachment has grown, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team have largely been circumspect on the question, most recently last week killing a move to launch impeachment.
One consideration voiced against impeachment has been political, in that the Republican Senate is certain to acquit Trump, leaving the impeached president in office.
However, Warren on Wednesday was at the annual NAACP meeting in Detroit, Mich., arguing that lawmakers had a higher duty than politics to consider.
“I understand there are people who for political reasons say this is not where we want to be, but in my view some things are above politics, and one of them is our constitutional responsibilities to do what is right, and the responsibility of the Congress of the United States of America, when a president breaks the law, is to bring impeachment charges against that president,” Warren said. “My view is, whether it would pass the Senate or not, this is a moment in history and every single person in Congress should be called on to vote and then to live with that vote for the rest of their lives.”

That’s according to Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, a Democrat who took part in questioning Mueller as a member of the House Intelligence Committee.

“I think success is that the American people will view this as volume one — I’m sorry, that the American people will view this as Act 1, not Act 3. And as they heard names today like Manafort and Kilimnik and Gates, they will want to know, well, let’s hear more about that, and that those witnesses will start to come forward,” Swalwell said, referring to former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort; Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political operative with connections to Russian intelligence; and Rick Gates, Manafort’s onetime associate. “I think we should have an impeachment inquiry and those are the next witnesses we need to hear from.”
Mueller spent some seven hours testifying about his two-year investigation Wednesday on Capitol Hill, spending time with both the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees.

295,"Sanders, Warren Lead Progressives’ Poll",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/sanders-warren-lead-progressives-poll/,"Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the top two leaders in a presidential poll taken by a prominent progressive organization of its supporters.
This third presidential preference poll by Democracy for America (DFA) has Sanders remaining in the lead, but shows Warren closing in on the dominate position he’s held in DFA’s first two surveys. It also features Sen. Kamala Harris leapfrogging into third over former vice president Joe Biden, who held on to the fourth place slot he had previously dropped to in April. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who vaulted into third place in DFA’s April poll, has seen the energy behind him fade dropping him to sixth.

Top five results from the DFA poll:
Bernie Sanders, 32.2 percent
Elizabeth Warren, 25.8 percent
Kamala Harris, 11.8 percent
Joe Biden, 9.5 percent
Andrew Yang, 6.61 percent
The poll, which began immediately following the June 27 Democratic presidential candidates debate through midnight (ET) July 17, is the third DFA has conducted of its membership regarding the 2020 presidential election. DFA’s first 2020 Presidential Pulse Poll was conducted in December 2018 and a second was completed in April 2019.
“The last three months have transformed the 2020 Democratic race for President and these results make it clear that Democracy for America members’ support is solidifying behind three candidates committed to bold, inclusive populism and structural reform,” said Charles Chamberlain, DFA chair.
“Going into the second debate, there’s little doubt that Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris have momentum building behind them. As Bernie Sanders continues in his position as the progressive front runner, we’re very interested to see if he uses this debate and the all-important month of August to build up from his robust base of support or cedes ground to the rising challenges of Senators Warren and Harris,” Chamberlain added.

“While a lot will change between today and the first contests next year, after seeing these results, there is no doubt that, in 2020, Democrats are better positioned to nominate an unapologetic champion for progressive values for President than we’ve been in decades,” he said.
Those who responded to the DFA poll were self-selecting and the poll should not be considered as a scientific public opinion poll.

296,Lawmakers Offer Green New Deal Alternative,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/lawmakers-offer-green-new-deal-alternative/,"Several leading House Democrats have introduced a new plan to deal with climate change and serve as an alternative to the so-called Green New Deal.
Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) and two committee subcommittee chairmen, Reps. Paul Tonko (D-NY) and Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), announced Tuesday that the committee is adopting a bold new target in its fight against climate change – achieving a 100 percent clean economy by 2050.

The committee’s plan to produce net zero greenhouse gas pollution by 2050 is consistent with the global scientific community’s consensus that meeting this target is necessary to avoid the most catastrophic effects of the climate crisis, according to the lawmakers.
The lawmakers’ plan stands out in contrast to the Green New Deal, which was offered by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). The Green New Deal would achieve a carbon-free economy 20 years earlier than the new Energy and Commerce plan.
“Communities across the country are suffering from historic flooding, raging wildfires, increasingly severe storms, extreme heat and persistent droughts,” Pallone said. “The climate crisis is here, and it requires serious federal leadership that’s up for the challenge. Today, we are announcing a plan that will help us produce comprehensive legislation to reach a 100 percent clean economy by 2050. This is an ambitious but necessary goal, and we’re committed to working hand-in-hand with all stakeholders across the country to get the job done.”
Over the coming months, the Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a series of hearings and stakeholder meetings to hear the best ideas for developing a deep decarbonization strategy. The stakeholder meetings will be designed to ensure every affected community, industry and stakeholder has a seat at the table. The outcome of this process will be comprehensive climate legislation to address the climate crisis and facilitate the transition of the U.S. economy to net zero greenhouse gas pollution by 2050.
The hearing series begins Wednesday, with the Environment and Climate Change subcommittee’s hearing on Pathways for Decarbonizing the U.S. Economy. In the upcoming months, the hearings will continue in both the Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee and the Energy Subcommittee.  Upcoming hearings will include discussions on reducing industrial emissions, reducing transportation emissions, modernizing the electric grid, economy-wide solutions and others.
“With record heatwaves, wildfires, flooding, and drought occurring more and more frequently in every region of the country, it is clear to the American people that now is the time for Congress and the federal government to act to address the issue of climate change,” Rush said. “The plan that we are unveiling here today demonstrates that the Energy and Commerce Committee understands the need for action and we are ready to move boldly to aggressively tackle this issue.
“As someone who represents a district whose constituents are disproportionately impacted by the symptoms of climate change, I look forward to working with Chairman Pallone, Chairman Tonko, and all of my Committee colleagues to meet with stakeholders to discuss the most effective ways to reach our goal of 100 percent clean economy by 2050,” Rush added.

In 2018 alone, the United States experienced 14 natural disasters costing a combined $91 billion. According to the U.S. government’s Fourth National Climate Assessment, lost wages due to extreme temperatures are projected to rise over the coming decades, reaching $160 billion per year by the end of the century, while the cost of lost property from coastal flooding is projected to reach $1 trillion.
The window for limiting the worst effects of these climate-related disasters is rapidly closing. According to the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, avoiding the most catastrophic outcomes requires cutting carbon pollution to net zero by 2050, the Energy and Commerce members said.

297,Rep. Krishnamoorthi on Mueller Testimony: A Lot More People Have Watched the Movie ‘The Godfather’ than Read the Book,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/rep-krishnamoorthi-on-mueller-testimony-a-lot-more-people-have-watched-the-movie-the-godfather-than-read-the-book/,"Having former special counsel Robert Mueller testify to Congress Wednesday after having already submitted a written report is a bit like how a novel often attracts a wider audience as a movie than as a book, according to a House Democrat.
Mueller is scheduled to respond to a congressional subpoena by appearing in person before two House committees. His testimony is to be televised.

Mueller is scheduled to appear before the House Judiciary Committee, where he is expected to discuss the obstruction of justice aspects of his investigation.
He also is expected to appear before the House Intelligence Committee, where his expected subject will be the Russian connection parts of his probe.
Mueller filed a report with the Justice Department about the investigation in March. Attorney General William “Bill” Barr has released only a redacted version of that report, however.
“I don’t think [Mueller] reading [from] the report would necessarily be very edifying or educational, but telling us what are the key findings and why they matter would be extremely important,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.). “I think the vast majority of the audience likely will not have read the report. I have, probably you have and I’ve been cramming for a final exam, so to speak, rereading sections, but I think most viewers are probably going to be digesting the report just by watching his testimony.
“It will be kind of like, a lot more people have watched the movie Godfather than read the book, and I think that’s certainly how people are going to approach this telecast,” Krishnamoorthi added.

298,"Scarborough: Trump Will Be ‘Routed,’ Lose in 2020 ‘Landslide’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/scarborough-trump-will-be-routed-lose-in-2020-landslide/,"MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, predicted that Donald Trump’s public displays of racism will lead him to defeat next year.
“This is going to end very badly for you,” Scarborough said, speaking to Trump. “Speaking of which … all of this is deeply offensive, but I’m already tired of all the op-eds I’m going to have to read after Donald Trump loses in a landslide. People saying, ‘Well, of course, this was due to happen because his bigotry only appealed to one-third of the electorate.’ That will happen. Just like we said Donald Trump could win, I’m telling you, that will happen.

“This is what gets me. This is such a losing proposition. This is the politics of subtraction. There is no way this leads to victory,” Scarborough added. “This gets women, suburban voters, educated voters, of course people of color. It gets them fired up in a way that they’ll go out to vote, whereas this depresses a lot of support for Donald Trump.
“That’s what I don’t understand, Elise,” Scarborough told journalist Elise Jordan. “Why he’s being a bigot and a racist, thinking that that’s going to help him get elected. It’s not! It’s going to ensure that he is routed next year.”

299,Want to Meet With the Trump Administration? Donald Trump Jr.’s Hunting Buddy Can Help,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/want-to-meet-with-the-trump-administration-donald-trump-jr-s-hunting-buddy-can-help/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
Over the past two years, the Trump administration has been grappling with how to handle the transition to the next generation of mobile broadband technology. With spending expected to run into hundreds of billions of dollars, the administration views it as an ultra-high-stakes competition between U.S. and Chinese companies, with enormous implications both for technology and for national security. Top officials from a raft of departments have been meeting to hash out the best approach.
But there’s been one person at some of the discussions who has a different background: He’s Donald Trump Jr.’s hunting buddy. Over the past two decades, the two have trained their sights on duck, pheasant and white-tailed deer on multiple continents. (An email from another Trump Jr. pal characterized one of their joint duck-hunting trips to Mexico years ago as “muy aggresivo.”)
Tommy Hicks Jr., 41, isn’t a government official; he’s a wealthy private investor. And he has been a part of discussions related to China and technology with top officials from the Treasury Department, National Security Council, Commerce Department and others, according to emails and documents obtained by ProPublica. In one email, Hicks refers to a meeting at “Langley,” an apparent reference to the CIA’s headquarters.


Hicks’ financial interests, if any, in the matters he has discussed aren’t clear. The interests are much more apparent when it comes to at least one of his associates. Hicks used his connections to arrange for a hedge fund manager friend, Kyle Bass — who has $143 million in investments that will pay off if China’s economy tanks — to present his views on the Chinese economy to high-level government officials at an interagency meeting at the Treasury Department, according to the documents.
Hicks is hardly the first private-sector power broker to emerge in a presidential administration, but he may represent a new subspecies: The Friend of the President’s Kid.
In fact, Hicks’ influence and career overwhelmingly hinge on two people: Trump Jr., his friend of about two decades, and, first and foremost, Hicks’ father. In a roughly 20-year career, Hicks has spent 17 of them working for investment funds and sports teams owned by his wealthy financier dad, Thomas Hicks Sr., and the other three working for a client of his father.
The generally privileged life of the younger Hicks has been speckled with occasional instances of misbehavior, one of them serious. At age 18, he pleaded no contest to misdemeanor assault, reduced from an original charge of felony aggravated assault, after he and two others were arrested in the beating of a fellow high school student at a party. (The victim was also kicked in the face during the assault, according to people familiar with the case. He told police that one of the three assailants — he didn’t say which — asked him, “What is your name, faggot?”) The criminal conviction did not prevent Hicks from being admitted to the University of Texas, where his father was an alumnus, a member of the Board of Regents and soon thereafter the first chairman of the University of Texas Investment Management Company, which manages the school’s endowment and other assets.
As an adult, friends say, Hicks’ carousing ways and occasional belligerent outbursts led some in his circle to bestow a heavily ironic nickname: “Senator Hicks.” His tenure as a director of the soccer team his father owned in Liverpool, England, a decade ago ended right after an email he sent to a heckling fan — “Blow me fuckface. Go to Hell. I’m sick of you.” — surfaced publicly.
Friends say Hicks has matured, particularly since he married and had three daughters. He has risen quickly in recent years. Hicks leveraged his Dallas financial network to become a top Trump campaign fundraiser in 2016 and a vice chairman of the inaugural finance committee; in January, he was named co-chairman of the Republican National Committee. His friends say he is motivated by patriotism.
Hicks also played a behind-the-scenes role, according to two people familiar with the matter and an account by a Turkish journalist, in the freeing last year of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor who was detained for two years by the Turkish government on what the U.S. government viewed as phony charges of spying and helping terrorists.
Even before becoming the second highest-ranking GOP official, Hicks was a frequent White House guest. He liked to have lunch in the White House mess with his half sister, who worked for a time in the communications operation. (The family is not related to Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director.) Hicks would then stroll the halls, according to a former senior administration official, dropping in to offices for impromptu chats with various officials, including Jared Kushner.


Those sorts of connections have given Hicks a convening power, the ability to call together multiple officials. “He basically opened the door for having a conversation with people who I didn’t know but needed to know,” said Robert Spalding, a former senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council during the Trump administration.
The efforts, detailed in hundreds of pages of government emails and other documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, show that Hicks had access to the highest levels of government to influence policymaking in ways that could lead to painful economic outcomes for the Chinese — and a potentially lucrative result for Hicks’ hedge fund friend, Bass.
“When somebody comes in like this, a hedge fund manager who has an interest in the viability of China’s economy, you’re giving them an opportunity to influence policy,” said Virginia Canter, a former ethics lawyer at the Treasury Department who now serves as chief ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group. (CREW has sued Donald Trump for accepting emoluments from foreign governments.) “The question is why?”
Hicks’ unusual role as a nongovernment employee who opened doors on behalf of both industry and others, Canter said, put him in a gray zone of ethics and lobbying regulations. “He’s acting in a lobbyist role when he may fall outside the lobbyist disclosure rules, and it’s not clear how he benefits financially,” she said. “So the question is: What’s he getting out of it? What are his friends getting out of it? And is the government processing it in a way that ensures the public benefits?”
Bass presented his views on China’s banking system in the office of Heath Tarbert, an assistant secretary at Treasury in charge of international markets and investment policy and a powerful intergovernmental committee that reviews foreign investments in the U.S. for national security concerns. Among the officials at the meeting with Tarbert were Bill Hinman, the director of the division of corporation finance at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ray Washburne, a wealthy Dallas restaurant owner and family friend of Hicks’ who was nominated by Trump to head the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
Hicks and Bass, both Dallas residents and longtime denizens of the financial community there, have invested together since at least 2011, according to securities filings and court records. They’ve owned shares of a publicly traded communications-technology manufacturer. And they were among the biggest creditors to the bankrupt law enforcement contracting company run by Chris Kyle, the ex-Navy SEAL portrayed by Bradley Cooper in “American Sniper.” The managing director of a new investment fund started by Hicks had previously advised Bass on the successful stock-shorting of a Texas real estate lender, according to corporate filings and court papers from a lawsuit in state court in Dallas.
But it’s not clear if Hicks or his family have an investment in Bass’ China-related funds. Reached twice on his cellphone, Hicks declined to be interviewed by ProPublica. In the second call, in June, Hicks didn’t dispute that he and his family have invested in Bass’ funds. But when asked to detail their business relationship, he cut the conversation short. “I’ve got to run. Let me see if I can get back to you,” Hicks said before hanging up. He didn’t call back.
Weeks later, after ProPublica followed up with questions to the RNC, a spokesman responded by emailing a “statement attributed to Tommy Hicks.” It read: “As a businessman, I passionately supported causes I believed in and, if appropriate, would sometimes meet with government officials to promote them. There is nothing wrong with that. I have taken every precaution during my time as Co-Chair of the RNC to ensure there is no conflict of interest between my job here and any personal businesses.” (The spokesperson also emailed a statement on behalf of the RNC: “Tommy has done an outstanding job working on behalf of President Trump and his agenda.”)
Bass, who made his name and fortune by betting against subprime mortgages before the crash and is known for large bets that economies or certain macro trends will turn downward, declined to comment. “I’m not interested in talking with you about my friends or any meetings I have or haven’t had privately with anyone,” he wrote in an email. In a subsequent message, Bass wrote that any suggestion “that we had corrupt intentions in meeting with Treasury officials… is categorically false and defamatory and could negatively affect our business.”
An administration official briefed on the Bass meeting at the Treasury downplayed it as “strictly a listening session.” He said Bass did not ask the attendees to take any actions, nor did the attendees divulge anything about U.S.-China policy. Government ethics officers vetted the federal employees for any conflicts and found none, the official said. He acknowledged that the review didn’t include an examination of any financial relationship between Hicks and Bass.
Spalding said the conversation centered primarily on Bass’ analysis of publicly available records on the Chinese financial system. “I think the thing that I’ve discovered over the past years is that the information in the private sector is better than anything we have in government,” Spalding said of Bass’ presentation. “You have to reach out to where the expertise is. In our country, that’s where the talent is.”
An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment. Washburne, now out of government, didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.
Bass has become a vocal advocate for an aggressive U.S. policy toward China. On Twitter and on cable business channels he’s denounced everything from the country’s Communist Party government to its business practices. Securities filings show Bass raised $143 million from about 81 investors in two funds — investments that would benefit if China’s currency were devalued or the country faced credit or banking crises. In April, in a letter to his investors, Bass wrote that his company, Hayman Capital Management, was positioned for coming problems in Hong Kong and was set up to “maintain a massive asymmetry to a negative outcome in Hong Kong and/or China.”
Hicks’ work on the 5G initiative was extensive.
Over just a few months in late 2017 and 2018, records show, he was part of an informal group led by then NSC official Spalding, that advocated for a strategy in which the federal government would plan out a national policy for 5G. One memo described their goal as the “equivalent of the Eisenhower National Highway System — a single, inherently protected, information transportation superhighway.”


The group conducted multiple meetings and briefings. For example, Hicks, Spalding and others traveled to Samsung Electronics’ Dallas-area offices for one meeting in January 2018.
That same month Hicks attended a 5G meeting that he’d arranged with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Commerce plays a key role in the future of 5G since a division within the agency manages government spectrum and another maintains a list of companies the government believes are, or will become, national security threats. Companies that end up on that list can be effectively shut out from global deal-making. The meeting with Ross focused heavily on the threat of China, said Ira Greenstein, who served as a White House aide and was part of Spalding’s 5G crew.
Hicks was one of a dozen nongovernment employees, including executives from Wells Fargo, Nokia, Ericsson and Google, that Spalding sent reading materials to ahead of a 5G discussion in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Copied on the email were top Commerce Department officials, a Booz Allen Hamilton contractor and a senior adviser for cybersecurity and IT modernization at the White House Office of Science and Technology. On the agenda? “Mid Band vs High Band” spectrum, “security,” “supply chain,” “financing” and other critical issues.
Hicks wasn’t just a passive observer. On Jan. 2, 2018, the managing director of OPIC, which provides financial backing to American companies expanding into foreign markets, emailed Spalding and others to say that the CEO of a satellite company called OneWeb had a plan to provide worldwide 5G coverage by 2027. Hicks fired back a note from his iPhone. “2027 is too late,” he wrote. “Let’s discuss as a smaller group tomorrow.”
Spalding was forced out of the West Wing in early 2018 after a draft 20-page briefing memo he authored proposing a government-organized national 5G network was leaked, then panned as an attempt to nationalize the wireless broadband industry. Trump has not pursued such an initiative, ultimately deferring to wireless carriers to bid on publicly maintained spectrum and develop their own networks as has traditionally been the case.
Still, the administration has made significant efforts to counter Chinese influence in 5G and related technologies, which are said to be critical for industries such as driverless cars, artificial intelligence, machine learning and much more. In May the Commerce Department barred Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei from doing business in the U.S. for national security reasons. And the top Department of Defense official in charge of acquisitions also recently announced the creation of a government-approved private marketplace to pair American private equity firms with U.S. technology companies producing products with national security applications to keep Chinese money out of 5G.
It isn’t clear what influence, if any, Hicks had in those decisions. But his profile is only rising. In April, he led a Republican delegation to Taiwan alongside a U.S. government delegation. Hicks met with the country’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, who has lately been positioning her country’s corporations as safer providers of 5G equipment than those in China. Tsai thanked the U.S. for selling arms to Taiwan. She asked Hicks to convey her regards to the Trumps.

300,New Legislation To Restore Homeowners’ Ability To Work Around GOP Tax Law’s Blue-state SALT Cap,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/new-legislation-to-restore-homeowners-ability-to-work-around-gop-tax-laws-blue-state-salt-cap/,"Following the introduction of new IRS rules that would block state-government workarounds to state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps enacted as part of last year’s GOP tax law, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate Finance Committee ranking Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon, and other Senate Democrats introduced a Congressional Review Act (CRA) Resolution of Disapproval to nullify the recent IRS decision, restore states’ ability to work around the caps, and allow homeowners to again fully retain their SALT deduction.
While the Treasury Department blocked states’ workarounds for families, the department in September 2018 issued guidance that allowed businesses to continue to benefit from these same workarounds.
The GOP tax law limited, for the first time, taxpayers’ SALT deduction, to $10,000 annually. This new limitation primarily hits such large blue states as California, Maryland, New Jersey and New York.

The limitation can cost taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars a year.
Some affected states have tried to get around the deduction cap by passing state-level legislation designed to convert state and local taxes to charitable contributions. Under this approach, taxpayers could donate to state and local funds and receive tax credits against their state and local taxes. The intention was for the taxpayers to deduct the donations as charitable contributions on their federal returns, which are not capped.
The IRS and Treasury Department blocked this approach, however.
“As if the Trump-Republican Tax Bill wasn’t already bad enough for middle class families, these new IRS regulations are another kick in the gut to homeowners in New York State and across the country,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). “The IRS is seeking to deny hardworking homeowners the benefit of the full SALT deduction while continuing their tax giveaway to the wealthiest few and corporations. Today, we are fighting back with a CRA Resolution of Disapproval, which is guaranteed a majority threshold up-or-down vote, would overturn the IRS’s recent attempt to block states from implementing workaround plans, and would allow homeowners to again fully receive this tax benefit. America’s homeowners deserve peace of mind.”
Under the pre-Trump tax code, taxpayers who itemized deductions on their federal income tax returns could deduct state and local real estate and personal property taxes, as well as either income taxes or general sales taxes. State and local income and real estate taxes had made up approximately 60 percent of local and state tax deductions while sales tax and personal property taxes made up the remainder, according to the Senate Democrats.

According to the Tax Policy Center, approximately one-third of tax filers had itemized deductions on their federal income tax returns.

301,"Federal Election Agency, Hungry for Funds, Now Pays for Officials to Get to Office",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/federal-election-agency-hungry-for-funds-now-pays-for-officials-to-get-to-office/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
For years, it was how things worked at the Election Assistance Commission, the federal agency charged with helping America’s thousands of local officials run elections: If you served as one of the agency’s four commissioners, making more than $150,000 a year, you lived in and around Silver Spring, Maryland, where the agency’s office is located. The reasons were straightforward: The agency’s small staff needed daily guidance from its leadership, and its modest budget was not meant to pay for commissioners to travel from out of state.
But this year, the EAC’s executive director, Brian Newby, allowed two of the four commissioners — including the agency’s chairwoman — to work outside the Washington, D.C., area and agreed to pick up the costs of their travel to and from the office. Christie McCormick and Donald Palmer, the two Republican commissioners, work most days from out of state — McCormick, the agency chairwoman, in Charlottesville, Virginia, and Palmer in a suburb of Jacksonville, Florida.
Newby appears to have approved the changes on his own. Current and former employees of the agency say no formal announcement was made, and the agency’s full slate of commissioners, which includes two Democrats, does not appear to have taken a vote on the change in practice.
The disclosures, contained in answers to questions the EAC provided to a congressional oversight committee, come as the agency has repeatedly claimed it is underfinanced and critics say it is not doing enough to assist election administrators around the country at a time of genuine threats to the integrity of the nation’s elections.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the Democratic chairwoman of the House Administration Committee, which oversees the EAC, said in a letter to the commission that news of the working arrangements for McCormick and Palmer “raises concerns about how much taxpayer money is being used to accommodate travel between duty stations and agency headquarters when the agency is avowedly struggling with its current funding levels.”


In its answers to the committee, the EAC said both that it compensated employees with duty stations outside of Washington for travel and that it had spent $0 on such travel in the first half of fiscal year 2019. Lofgren has asked for clarification on this apparent inconsistency. Interviews with some EAC staff members indicate that McCormick and Palmer only show up in the agency’s office occasionally.
“I don’t know what [McCormick and Palmer] are doing,” said one current employee. “They don’t know what I’m doing either.” Another employee simply shrugged when asked the last time they could recall interacting with McCormick in the office.
The agency has an annual budget of roughly $8 million and a staff of about 30 employees. The agency is meant to dole out federal dollars allocated to election administration, act as a clearinghouse for quality election information and collect data on election administration nationally. Most decisions made by the EAC require a majority vote of the four commissioners, necessitating bipartisanship. The agency is currently, for example, in the process of considering the next edition of Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, which would require a vote of all four commissioners. The agency has not yet responded to ProPublica’s request for the tally votes taken by the commissioners in recent months.
In a joint statement, McCormick and Palmer said that they are in the office “regularly” and that they frequently travel to other states to advise and communicate with election administrators. They said they are “in daily communication with senior leadership at the Commission to assure the agency’s effectiveness.”
A spokesperson for the EAC declined comment on the answers provided to its oversight committee, indicating the agency would respond to Lofgren’s concerns prior to issuing statements to the media. She indicated that the “senior leadership” included Newby and General Counsel Cliff Tatum but offered no clarity on how often they communicate with lower-level EAC staff.
Tom Hicks and Ben Hovland, the agency’s two Democratic commissioners, are based in the Washington area and are said by other employees to be in the office regularly. Employees at the EAC say that they’ve continued to do their work largely unsupervised, and that McCormick and Palmer rarely offer guidance on their work.


The decision to begin reimbursing the agency’s leadership for travel comes at a time when McCormick and other commissioners have repeatedly said that the agency’s effectiveness is in jeopardy over lack of funds. At a May 15 hearing before the Senate Rules Committee, McCormick told senators that the agency was at a “critical crossroads with regard to having sufficient resources necessary to support state and local election administrators and the voters they serve.”
DeForest “Buster” Soaries Jr. was a Republican commissioner and the agency’s first chairperson when it first started its work in 2003. He said in an interview that he’d inquired about having his travel expenses from New Jersey reimbursed. The request was denied. Paul DeGregorio, a former Republican commissioner who also served as chairman, also understood that commissioners were required to be in the Washington area and that travel expenses would not be reimbursed.
“It was always my understanding when I took the job that my location or duty station was D.C., and that was the intent of the [Help America Vote Act],” he said, referencing the law that established the agency.
DeGregorio said he paid his own expenses to fly between St. Louis and Washington and for his own apartment in D.C., where he spent weekdays. Soaries said he paid his own expenses to travel between Washington and New Jersey, where he pastored a church.
Both Soaries and DeGregorio expressed skepticism at the idea that the job of a commissioner could be done remotely. Both indicated that commissioners needed to be on hand to manage the agency’s relatively small staff, and that decisions about the direction of the agency would require a vote of all commissioners, a task that requires constant communication. Current EAC staff members say that the full set of commissioners are rarely on hand to discuss matters, and telephone communication happens only rarely.
“It’s a full-time job that requires presence and participation,” Soaries said. “The amount of deliberation that had to occur required us to talk to each other consistently and arrive at a consensus.”
DeGregorio said the arrangement was “odd,” and said that — especially as chair — it would have been nearly impossible to appropriately oversee the work of the agency’s executive director, whom the commissioners are responsible for appointing and supervising.
Lofgren, in her correspondence with the EAC, also raised questions about how Palmer had been compensated by the agency.
Palmer, who was confirmed unanimously by the Senate in January 2019, was paid a total of $73,946 to work part time as a “senior adviser” to the agency over the prior year. Lofgren indicated in the correspondence that the agency had been unable to say what exactly Palmer had done as the adviser, and current employees said Palmer reported directly to Newby. None could explain what he’d accomplished.
“This raises at least the appearance of impropriety, if not impropriety itself,” Lofgren said in her letter to the EAC.
This may not have been Palmer’s only position with the agency before his confirmation. In July 2017, McCormick emailed members of President Donald Trump’s “voter fraud” commission to urge them to hire Palmer. “He is currently working on [a National Voting Rights Act] project for the EAC as a contractor,” she wrote, calling him a “Christian” and a “believer in the cause.”

302,"Google Cares About One Thing, and It Isn’t Politics",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/google-cares-about-one-thing-and-it-isnt-politics/,"It’s interesting that as time goes by the list of sources of information that “can’t be trusted” because of “liberal bias” keeps getting bigger and bigger.
At first, it was just certain newspapers, certain news channels, then just “the media, the mainstream media can’t be trusted, liberal bias.” Then it was Snopes. Then came PolitiFact. Naturally, that was started by a liberally slanted newspaper, so of course, you can’t trust that.
Then they came for Google — and there was no one left to speak for Google.

Let’s be clear. There is no bias in Google’s search results. If you’re listening to people telling you that there is, you should be thinking about why they are telling you that the best, most available, freest research tool ever made, the tool that makes it easiest to check the truth of anything anyone says to you is biased. That you shouldn’t trust it. What does that tool tell you about the rest of what they say when you search through it?
If you search Google and every time you do a search, you feel like the results must be biased, you need to look somewhere else. Not another search engine.
Inward.
The bias you see when you look at your Google search results is your own.
Your point of view has been shoved so far to one side that normal everyday average, the status quo looks outrageous to you, you can’t find anything in it to confirm your bias, so it must, you conclude, be manipulated.
The thing is, it’s not. You should really think about that.
Let’s talk about how search engines in general and Google specifically work.
I’ve been in Internet Marketing for more than 15 years. I currently serve as the VP of Digital Strategy for a boutique Internet marketing agency serving mostly local small to medium-sized businesses. It is my job to know how Google works because it is my job to help my clients be more visible in search results that matter to them.

Search engines in general and Google specifically crawl the web constantly indexing any content they find. When you do a search, Google searches through all the content it has listed and looks for:
The most relevant piece of content to the search
From the most authoritative source on the subject
Which has proven to be a trustworthy source of information
That is likely to deliver the user a positive experience if they click through.
Google cares about one thing, and it isn’t politics. It’s being so good at delivering the absolute best result to your search that you never feel like you have to use another source.
Injecting bias is so counter to that ideal, anyone who suggested it would never work in Silicon Valley again.
One of the problems sites like, for example, InfoWars runs into is the trustworthiness part of the algorithm. Certain types of users do searches related to, for example, Chemtrails. That certain type of user listens to InfoWars religiously. When that user does a search for Chemtrails online, the results seem skewed to him. He has trouble finding content that confirms his bias. He doesn’t see content written by Alex Jones, so Google must be manipulating the results, right?
Wrong.
It is so easy not to run afoul of the trustworthiness part of Google’s algorithm it’s not even funny. It’s not human, for Christ’s sake, it’s a math equation, a “process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.” Definition of ALGORITHM. All you need to do to keep from running afoul of that part of the algorithm is to be consistent, not conflict with every trustworthy source listed and not show up at the bottom of every trusted source list on the internet. (Guess what? Yup. Every single one of those lists is indexed as well.)

At the end of the day, most people trust their eyes. When you dig through a source like Google for information on a particular topic, you can do one of two things.
Take the aggregate what you find at face value or
Keep digging and digging until you find something, anything that agrees with your preconceived notions. (I promise, if you keep digging, you’ll find something.)
See the problem with the second path?

303,What Can Be Done Right Now to Stop a Basic Source of Health Care Fraud,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/what-can-be-done-right-now-to-stop-a-basic-source-of-health-care-fraud/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
In our story about the convicted health care con man David Williams, we detailed how the Texas personal trainer made off with millions by billing some of the nation’s largest health insurers as if he were a doctor providing medical services.
Williams cannily exploited gaping loopholes in the health insurance system that allowed him almost unfettered entry. Taking commonsense steps to close those loopholes, experts say, could block other fraudsters from entry.
1. No one checks to see whether people getting federal ID numbers that allow them to bill insurers have valid licenses. They could.
Anyone billing an insurance company needs a National Provider Identifier, or NPI number. The number is obtained through Medicare, a federal agency that covers people over 65 as well as those with disabilities. But Medicare doesn’t verify that NPI applicants who claim to be licensed are, indeed, licensed by their state’s regulators. The agency could do a license check in less than a minute online or in milliseconds if the process is automated.


Medicare said federal regulations do not allow it to verify NPI applicants’ credentials, so the Department of Health and Human Services might need to revise the regulations. Congress could also order the reform.
2. Insurance companies don’t always verify that the people they are paying are licensed medical providers. They could.
Williams avoided scrutiny from insurers by billing as an out-of-network provider, so he didn’t have a contract with them and didn’t have his credentials verified before receiving payments. At Williams’ trial on federal fraud charges, representatives from the insurance companies testified that it’s not cost effective to review every claim. Almost all are automatically paid.
At a minimum, insurers could ensure that anyone billing them has the proper licensing before a payment is made. Again, this screening would take seconds or less.
Regulators could also require that insurers verify the licenses of those they pay. Some experts say it may take state and federal legislation to mandate it. Officials from America’s Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for the insurers, declined to comment on this suggestion.
3. Insurance companies aren’t reporting most cases of suspected fraud to state and federal regulators. They could.
Many states have a law in place that requires insurers to report suspected cases of fraud to state regulators. This allows regulators to spot serial fraudsters and trends, and it helps officials build criminal and civil cases. But the states have a mishmash of requirements, and many don’t do audits to make sure cases are being reported.
At least three insurance companies caught Williams committing fraud. But the Texas Department of Insurance only received one referral about the case, according to internal documents. If all three insurers that Williams defrauded had referred him, his case could have been prioritized and stopped sooner.


The existing state laws don’t apply to self-funded plans where employers pay for the health benefits. Those are overseen by the federal government. And no federal law requires insurers who administer self-funded plans to report suspected cases of fraud.
State and federal laws would need to be changed to require the consistent reporting of suspected fraud. Experts say audits, and the potential for fines, may also be needed to spur the insurers to file the reports.

304,"Conservatives, Not Liberals, Are The Ones Not Interested in Other Viewpoints",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/conservatives-not-liberals-are-the-ones-not-interested-in-other-viewpoints/,"Conservatives seem to like to complain that liberals and progressives don’t consider other views and think that they are always right.
Here’s the thing: we do consider viewpoints other than our own. Embracing pluralism is one of the big tenets of any liberal or progressive movement — you aim to be inclusive, as much as possible.
Problem is, when you’re dealing with the conservative side of things, it’s less about embracing differences and more about having those differences restricted for you. It’s one of the ironies of the right that we’re told that you’re all for personal freedom and less government interference in the lives of the citizenry.

Unless you want to have an abortion (or at least want the right to have one).
Unless you’re part of the LGBTQ community.
Unless you’re an immigrant, legal or otherwise.
Honestly, I’m willing to consider any viewpoint you wish to offer — but at least make sure it’s a reasonable one. Respecting your viewpoint doesn’t mean I need to honour it, or adopt it, or force others around me to adopt it. That’s not how it works.
You have to be clear on that point: we’ll listen to what you have to say, but if you think that means we must change our actions, beliefs or policies, you’re clearly indicating that you think you’re right, and what we think doesn’t matter.
If you don’t like abortion, don’t have one. If you don’t like gay marriage, fair enough, but don’t aim to stop those who do. That’s where you find the middle ground, honestly: it’s like the left and gun rights, yes? Nobody wants to take away all your guns — that’s a mischaracterisation of the left’s position. You believe in gun ownership, and while we don’t like guns being so easily accessible, we can still respect your right to own them. All we ask are that sensible precautions be taken to ensure public safety — that’s where your compromise comes in.
The only time either side has to put their foot down is when something is stated as being unequivocal. My way or the highway — but, oddly enough, it’s very rare that those positions are taken in people’s personal sense of politics. About 99.9 percent of the time, the absolutes exist only as mischaracterisations of more complex political positions. It’s easier to say, “Democrats want open borders!” than to say, “Democrats recognise that immigrant labour is vital to the US economy, but wish to create stringent security measures designed to keep out elements that may be harmful to the United States, while not penalising those who have come in search of a better life, which we believe is the foundation of what the US stands for.”

See the difference? One’s a policy position, the other’s a slanderous soundbite.
The way you come together is by embracing the complexities of each other’s political positions, and working to find a suitable middle ground. The moment either side stands on an absolute…there’s no way to compromise.

305,"After Grueling Week, Ilhan Omar Greeted in Minnesota by Cheering Crowd Chanting ‘Welcome Home’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/after-grueling-week-ilhan-omar-greeted-in-minnesota-by-cheering-crowd-chanting-welcome-home/,"It’s hard to believe that it’s been less than a week.
But since Sunday, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota was among four first-year, progressive non-white Democratic congresswomen singled out in one of Donald Trump’s tweet-attacks, this one decidedly racist, telling the women to “go back” to the countries they came from.
However, only Omar was actually born outside of the United States. A refugee from Somalia, she has been a naturalized citizen since 2000.
The racist focus on Omar only grew, as Trump supporters began chanting, “Send her back!” during a Wednesday night campaign rally in North Carolina.

For the nation, the event sparked convulsions of racism that continue today. But for Omar, it’s been a highly personal experience.
She responded to this extraordinary pressure with grace, posting on Twitter a quote from a Maya Angelou poem;
You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I’ll rise.
Omar also shared a meal with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of the two-dozen or so hopefuls vying for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Sanders shared the experience with his supporters in a Thursday email.
“Last night, I was at dinner with Ilhan Omar, her daughter, and some other members of Congress when we heard the news that thousands of people at a Donald Trump rally were chanting ‘send her back,'” Sanders wrote.
“To my surprise, Ilhan was pretty unfazed. Sadly, as she told me, she has been dealing with this kind of hatred and racism for a long time,” he added.
At week’s end, however, the congresswoman was able to fly home, where she was greeted at the airport by a throng of well-wishers all chanting: “Welcome home, Ilhan! Welcome home, Ilhan! Welcome home, Ilhan!”

306,Trump Administration Would Save Insurers Billions by Undermining Health Care Protections,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trump-administration-would-save-insurers-billions-by-undermining-health-care-protections/,"Insurance companies could save billions of dollars under the Trump administration’s move to undermine patient and consumer protections under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), according to a new analysis from the Center for American Progress.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) wants to undercut an existing rule that bars discrimination in health care. This would give health care entities a license to discriminate against LGBTQ people and many others, according to the analysis, published as a column by the Washington-based, left-leaning think tank.
The proposed change also would no longer require health care providers, pharmacy benefit managers, and insurers to include certain information about patients’ health care rights. That includes providing notices about accessible and quality care in foreign languages spoken by patients with limited proficiency in English, according to the analysis.

This change would limit the ability of about 25 million patients in the United States to understand their medical care and coverage. Documents show that insurance companies lobbied for the elimination of this language access protection.
HHS justifies these attacks on patient protections by claiming that the changes would result in about $3.6 billion in cost savings for providers. Yet nowhere in the proposed rule does HHS address the human cost these savings would have on people who might be unaware of lifesaving medical information.
The future of US healthcare is heating up as a key issue in the coming 2020 elections. Donald Trump has steadily made war against the ACA, also known as Obamacare.
On the other side, some Democratic presidential candidates want to build on Obamacare. Others want to move away entirely to a single-payer “Medicare-for-all” approach.

307,It’s Illegal for Federal Officials to Campaign at Work. A Trump Official Just Did So.,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/its-illegal-for-federal-officials-to-campaign-at-work-a-trump-official-just-did-so/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
Federal workplaces are supposed to be free of politics, but a Trump administration appointee used a government forum Wednesday to express support for the president’s reelection.
At a conference on religious freedom hosted by the State Department, an official told the crowd of several hundred people that “hopefully he will be reelected,” referring to President Donald Trump.
It’s illegal for federal employees to engage in political activities while they are on the job.
“It’s a violation of the Hatch Act for a federal official, to say in her official capacity, to hope that the president will be reelected,” said Kathleen Clark, an expert on legal ethics at the Washington University in St. Louis.
It’s not the first time a Trump administration official has appeared to cross a line. In a harsh report, a government ethics office concluded that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was a “repeat offender” and recommended she be fired.


“Ms. Conway’s violations, if left unpunished, would send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act’s restrictions,” the ethics office wrote. “Her actions thus erode the principal foundation of our democratic system — the rule of law.”
Trump did not punish Conway.
The latest questionable comment came from Samah Norquist, a special adviser on religious pluralism in the Middle East at the U.S. Agency for International Development. Norquist is also the wife of conservative tax activist Grover Norquist.
In response to ProPublica’s questions, Tom Babington, a USAID spokesman, said in a written statement that agency personnel “immediately alerted” USAID’s chief legal officer about the comment. The legal office sent the issue to USAID’s ethics official for review and action.
“The Agency takes the Hatch Act very seriously and requires all employees to receive annual ethics training, which includes training on the Hatch Act,” Babington said. “No final decision has been made regarding a determination of a violation or potential appropriate administrative action.”
The political references began when the panel moderator, Norquist, read a written question from an audience member. “What happens to U.S. involvement in Iraq if Trump loses the election?” the query said, sparking awkward laughter.
Max Primorac, the USAID special representative for minority assistance programs in Iraq, answered first, noting that Congress had passed in 2018 a bipartisan bill authorizing the State Department to give relief to the victims of Islamic State, particularly religious minorities such as Christians, Yazidis and Shiite Muslims, holding it up as proof that the whole country supports the policy.
Primorac then added, “President Trump will win again, but I’m very confident that this is now an American project.”
Norquist echoed his remarks about religious minorities in Iraq, calling it “an American issue” rather than a partisan one. Then, she veered into politics. She added, “And we all hope whether it’s Trump, and hopefully he will be reelected, or not, that it continues to be a priority for our government.”
Here is the exchange.
Norquist and Primorac did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

308,Meghan McCain: ‘My Message to George Conway Is Start at Home’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/meghan-mccain-my-message-to-george-conway-is-start-at-home/,"Meghan McCain, always counted on as a Donald Trump critic, jumped publicly amidst the politically fraught marriage of George and Kellyanne Conway–as husband and wife stood up on opposite sides of this week’s controversy over Trump’s racist tweets.
Loyal Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway made headlines of her own when she asked a reporter about his nation of origin after he inquired about Trump’s tweets telling four non-white Democratic congresswomen to “go back” to the countries they came from.
Meanwhile, husband George Conway–a conservative attorney but regular Trump gadfly in his own right–published a prominent op-ed in The Washington Post using his own Filipino experience to denounce Trump as racist in no uncertain terms.

During a discussion on her TV show The View, McCain offered no sympathy for either Conway.
“What I will say is her husband is one of the most adamant, outspoken people, especially against what he interpreted as the president’s tweets being racist,” she said. “And my message to George Conway is: ‘Start at home, okay?’ If me and my husband were together — no. I’m sick of this. Because he gets on his high horse on Twitter all day long. If I felt like my husband were going on TV and saying racist comments, and things like this, and I were so outraged, we would be having a conversation.”

309,Trump Thinks of ‘The Squad’ as His Ticket to Ride in 2020,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trump-thinks-of-the-squad-as-his-ticket-to-ride-in-2020/,"“Lock her up!” no more.
At a Wednesday night rally in North Carolina, Donald Trump and his team have morphed their days-long racist battle with four non-white Democratic congresswomen into his new campaign cry, “Send her back!”
In doing so, it singles out the one member of the Democratic group not actually born in the United States, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Omar came to the United States as a Somali refugee as a child and has long been a naturalized citizen.
“Think about all the photographs of people when African American children were allowed to go to school with whites who stood on the sidewalk and spit towards them. And cursed them. And now look at the pictures,” said famed former CBS News journalist Dan Rather. “Those people who are still alive have to be ashamed of the photographs. I think the same thing will happen with the people shouting [at the Trump rally]. I think the cheer didn’t come up spontaneously. It has the earmarks.

“‘Lock her up’ sounds dated. What else do we have? We have to see clearly the president sees these four young congresswomen as his ticket to ride in 2020,” Rather added. “In his view, every time anybody on TV puts them up in front or does an interview with them, or in a newspaper. He thinks he wins.”
Despite Trump’s protestations to the contrary, what he is doing is re-normalizing racism, according to Zerlina Maxwell, host at SiriusXM Radio.
“I felt like this is where that originated and that sort of fervor and that racial resentment being openly what Donald Trump has done is normalize racism that has been true going back to birtherism, and he makes it okay again to be overtly racist in public without any fear that there will be any societal repercussions whatsoever,” Maxwell said. “And that is not something that I am willing to, you know, sit around and be silent about. And I don’t think anybody that feels that racism is an unacceptable and unpatriotic position to have and to express in public. They should not be silent in this moment either.”
Whether this open racism works in the short term, former White House adviser David Gergen predicts long-term suicide for the Republican Party.
“Listen, I think that this may work in a short term for Republicans but if you look at the long term, it’s a much bleaker picture for the Republican Party,” said Gergen, an adviser to presidents of both parties. “All the millennials will be a massive force with women, people of color and new politics just five, 10, 15 years down the road.
“I think Republicans are in an active slow self-destruction in supporting the president as much as they do because in the long term, this could be suicidal,” he added.

So the Company Started Charging the Disabled, the Unemployed and Students.",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trumps-tax-law-threatened-turbotaxs-profits-so-the-company-started-charging-the-disabled-the-unemployed-and-students/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

The 2017 tax overhaul vastly expanded the number of people who could file simplified tax returns, a boon to millions of Americans.
But the new law directly threatened the lucrative business of Intuit, the maker of TurboTax.
Although the company draws in customers with the promise of a “free” product, its fortunes depend on getting as many customers as possible to pay. It had been regularly charging $100 or more for returns that included itemized deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations. Under the new law, many wealthier taxpayers would no longer be filing that form, qualifying them to use the company’s free software.
Intuit executives came up with a way to preserve the company’s hefty profit margins: It began charging more low-income people. Which ones? Individuals with disabilities, the unemployed and people who owe money on student loans, all of whom use tax forms that TurboTax previously included for free. The shift was described to ProPublica by two people familiar with the process.
The strategy worked well for the company. In May, it announced that its TurboTax unit had grown quarterly revenue by 10%, to $2.2 billion, despite the new tax law.
Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi obliquely alluded to the strategy on a call with Wall Street analysts, saying the “tuned product lineup, adjusted for the new tax legislation” helped the company bring in more money. He presented the move as good for taxpayers.
“We needed to change our lineup this year to ensure that we delivered for customers, given the tax code changes,” Goodarzi said. He told investors: “We are big supporters of tax simplification. We believe that it enables consumers to take more control over their financial life.”


An Intuit spokesman declined to answer detailed questions about the changes, but said in a statement, “More taxpayers filed their taxes last year with TurboTax and paid absolutely nothing than any other year.” He also said the “completely free customer group” grew at a faster rate than TurboTax as a whole. The spokesman declined to break down numbers or comment on specific cases.
Under a 2002 deal with the government, most Americans are supposed to be able to file their taxes for free as long as they make under $66,000 a year. In return, the IRS has agreed not to offer its own free service.
But, as ProPublica has been reporting, Intuit has steered eligible customers away from the truly free version, aggressively marketing products that are called “free” even though many customers end up paying. For an outsider, Intuit’s lineup of products is dizzying. The company’s commercial ecosystem includes four price tiers: Free Edition, Deluxe, Premier and Self-Employed. The goal, according to former employees, is to draw in people with the promise of “free” and then get them to pay. Some pay because they have to file extra forms. Some pay for ancillary services.
Because the new law almost doubled the standard deduction, Intuit faced a loss of users of its Deluxe edition. Most of the millions of Americans who would no longer be itemizing their deductions are relatively affluent — making more than $75,000 a year — but they would now potentially be eligible to use the Free Edition.
In response, the company bumped a number of forms typically used by lower-income filers, which were previously available in the Free Edition, into paying editions. “They were always supposed to be customer focused, customer first,” one former staffer said. But the income levels of the groups that were being driven to paid products “was never really considered.”
Thirty TurboTax customers told ProPublica that they were charged as a result of needing to use one of the forms that used to be free.
One of these forms was for a tax credit that goes exclusively to poor taxpayers who are elderly or get disability benefits. Another is used by low- to middle-income households that receive a credit for putting money in a retirement account. A third is used by taxpayers who collected unemployment benefits.
One large affected group was current and former students. They are now prompted to upgrade to the Deluxe edition after entering information from basic documents, such as the one that shows tuition costs. And then there are people with student loans, who also have to use Deluxe. Last year, more than 5 million taxpayers in the United States with income below $50,000 claimed the student loan interest deduction.
The company’s changes also affected parents who get a credit for child care expenses, as well as people filing the schedule for interest and dividends. Those likely represent a smaller part of TurboTax’s users because its customer base skews lower income, former employees said.
Last April, Kristan Obeng, then a student pursuing a master’s degree at the University of Arizona, was running out of time to file her taxes as the semester chugged to an end. So she Googled and soon was on TurboTax’s website, which promised she could file for “Free Guaranteed.” She didn’t realize it, but she was now in Intuit’s paid ecosystem. She was using the “Free Edition.” Starting there, some customers still file for free but many need tax forms that push them into paid products.
Her financial details weren’t complicated. She’d made just over $12,000 at her job as a graduate teaching assistant. She had student loans. She was in school. That was it. After she began filling in her details on TurboTax, she got some good news. “Congrats, you qualify for a tax break!” the site said. But there was a catch. She would have to “upgrade to TurboTax Deluxe to claim it.”
When Intuit had cut the list of forms covered by TurboTax’s Free Edition in response to the Trump tax overhaul, it had removed Form 1098-E. The form is a statement prepared by companies that handle student loan payments. It shows how much interest the borrower paid that year. To file Obeng’s taxes, TurboTax would not even need the form itself, but it would list a single number, the amount of interest paid, on Schedule 1 of the main tax form, the 1040.


That number, it turned out, would cost Obeng $60. Add TurboTax’s charge for state returns, and Obeng owed the company $111. On top of that, she was charged an additional $40 because she opted to pay the TurboTax fee out of her refund, rather than upfront. (If she had been able to file for free, there would have been no need to deduct any fees from her refund.)
In all, she ended up paying $151.
Although she didn’t realize it at the time, that $151 dwarfed the “tax break” TurboTax had prompted her to claim. The student loan interest deduction had only cut her taxes by $26.
Obeng said she was irritated at having to pay for something she thought was going to be free. And she became angry when she read ProPublica’s reporting about how Intuit had hidden access to the program it conducted under the deal with the IRS, which is called “Free File.” The qualifications for that program were income-based, and her income had been well below the level to qualify. So she called up Intuit and asked for her money back.
Like many other ProPublica readers, Obeng was denied a refund. She’d started in TurboTax’s Free Edition, not Free File, and she’d been charged because student loan interest wasn’t covered in the Free Edition, the Intuit representative told her.
“And was this always the case or did you add this recently?” Obeng asked.
“I believe this was always the case,” the Intuit representative said. But that is not accurate. The 1098-E form was free until this year.
The changes also affected Americans who got unemployment benefits. That’s what pushed John Symonds of Connecticut into the Deluxe edition. TurboTax charged him $106 to file his federal and state returns. He opted to use his refund to pay that fee, but when the refund didn’t come through, Intuit attempted to take the money from his bank account.
He didn’t have $100 in his account, he told ProPublica, and, since he’d turned to driving for Uber after being laid off, he needed what money was in his account to pay for gas. He called his bank and stopped the transaction. “I wouldn’t have been able to continue working,” he said.
Inside TurboTax headquarters in San Diego, in the spring and summer of 2018, marketing staffers came up with several options for how the company could change the forms it offered in its free and paid products, according to two former staffers.
Throughout 2018, Intuit executives assured Wall Street analysts that they had a plan to address the risk that fewer people would have to use a form that the company charged for.
It’s “something that we’re very aware of,” Greg Johnson, the head of Intuit’s TurboTax unit, told investors in September 2018. “And the fact that we’re aware of it allows us to experiment, it allows us to get closer to customers and find out strategies around how we’re going to address that.”
Intuit analysts mined the company’s vast store of customer and tax return data to project how much revenue would be gained if a particular tax form was moved from the Free Edition to one of the paid editions, the former staffers said.
The change confronting Intuit was seismic. Recent IRS statistics show that, compared with last year, 26 million fewer taxpayers itemized their deductions this year. “When you do the market analysis and you realize how much revenue you’re going to potentially lose, they have to make changes,” one of the former staffers said.
Executives were nervous that the changes the company was experimenting with could backfire. In 2015, after Intuit required some users of TurboTax’s desktop version to pay to file previously included tax forms, customers revolted. In response to the backlash, the company reversed the changes, apologized and gave back $25. “I deeply regret the anger and distress we have caused those of you affected by this,” said Goodarzi, TurboTax chief at the time.
Despite those concerns, Intuit’s leaders decided in 2018 to remove several forms from its Free Edition.
Internal company estimates suggested that as many as 30% of users who had been eligible for the Free Edition would be bumped into a paid product, one of the former staffers said. The Intuit spokesman didn’t respond to a question about the number.
Last December, the company issued a press release announcing its Free Edition for the 2019 filing season — “TurboTax Free Edition. Free Federal. Free State. Free To File.” It highlighted seven features of the product, including one allowing customers to import relevant data from last year’s tax return to this year’s, which had previously been part of a paid add-on bundle.
It did not disclose that people with student loans, the unemployed and others would no longer be able to use Free Edition.
On the company’s website, the only changes were subtle. Whereas last year, when the site had trumpeted that “60 million hard-working Americans” were eligible to file for free with TurboTax, this year, that number dropped to 50 million.

311,CNN Hosts Take on Trump Over Roots of His ‘Go Back’ Tweets,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/cnn-hosts-take-on-trump-over-roots-of-his-go-back-tweets/,"Donald Trump’s recent tweets telling four non-white Democratic congresswomen to “go back” to the countries they came from not only were racist, but miss the mark about what it means to be an American.
That’s according to popular primetime CNN hosts Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo.
While denying racist intent, Trump and members of his staff have expanded on anyone who doesn’t “love” the country should leave.

Lemon took issue with that sentiment, in on-air remarks.
“This is not about love for the country. I hope we all love our country. Listen: Part of loving our country is being able to criticize the country,” Lemon said. “… That’s the whole point of America. We can criticize this whole thing and make it better. This is about racist comments from the president of the United States. Racist comments he is trying to reframe as a battle against antiamericanism. And people are buying into it.
“It’s sad. ‘Love it or leave it.’ It’s not what this is about. That’s not what America is about. We’re not about that. That’s not what makes America great,” Lemon added. “What makes America great is our the ability to be able to decent. Our rights to life. To liberty. And the pursuit of happiness. Today the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged Republicans to join Democrats in condemning the president’s Tweets. And went onto stay this. On the house floor.”
In his remarks, Cuomo referenced his own Italian heritage, as the son of the late New York governor Mario Cuomo.
“Is it getting to me. It hits close to home. To be honest. My grandparents were afraid of people like Trump,” Cuomo said. “Ironically they grew up very close to one another. Where Trump grew up is blocks from where my grandparents finally made some advantage but they were afraid of people and being judged and told to go back and called unclean and left in the ghetto. Where all the immigrants were together like mud. And I remember them. I remember what it was like.”
“My father you didn’t get to know him enough. You would have loved him,” Cuomo told Lemon. “He made a joke that I was the first white guy in the family. We finally made it. He’s got lighter colored eyes and went to the good school. We’re white now we made it.”

312,A Border Patrol Agent Reveals What It’s Really Like to Guard Migrant Children,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/a-border-patrol-agent-reveals-what-its-really-like-to-guard-migrant-children/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
The Border Patrol agent, a veteran with 13 years on the job, had been assigned to the agency’s detention center in McAllen, Texas, for close to a month when the team of court-appointed lawyers and doctors showed up one day at the end of June.
Taking in the squalor, the stench of unwashed bodies, and the poor health and vacant eyes of the hundreds of children held there, the group members appeared stunned.
Then, their outrage rolled through the facility like a thunderstorm. One lawyer emerged from a conference room clutching her cellphone to her ear, her voice trembling with urgency and frustration. “There’s a crisis down here,” the agent recalled her shouting.
At that moment, the agent, a father of a 2-year-old, realized that something in him had shifted during his weeks in the McAllen center. “I don’t know why she’s shouting,” he remembered thinking. “No one on the other end of the line cares. If they did, this wouldn’t be happening.”


As he turned away to return to his duties, the agent recalled feeling sorry for the lawyer. “I wanted to tell her the rest of us have given up.”
It’s rare to hear from Border Patrol agents, especially since the Trump administration has put them at the front lines of its sweeping immigration crackdown. Public access to them is typically controlled and choreographed. When approached off duty, agents say they risk their jobs if they speak about their work without permission. As a result, much about the country’s largest federal law enforcement agency — with some 20,000 agents policing the borders and ports — remains shrouded in secrecy, even from congressional oversight, making it nearly impossible to hold it accountable.
Disturbing glimpses of some agents have recently begun to fill the void, including some that were published recently after ProPublica obtained screenshots from a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents that showed several agents and at least one supervisor had posted crude, racist and misogynistic comments about immigrants and Democratic members of Congress. The posts raised questions about whether the deplorable detention conditions on the border were out of the control of Customs and Border Protection, as the agency had asserted, or a reflection of its culture.
Other reports followed, including one from CNN that described agents attempting to humiliate a Honduran immigrant by trying to force him to be photographed holding a sign that read in Spanish, “I like men.” The Intercept published more degrading posts from the secret Facebook group, and it reported that it appeared that Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost had once been a member. Provost has not commented.
But there was some nuance. An account of life inside a Border Patrol detention facility outside El Paso, Texas, by The New York Times and The El Paso Times, revealed that two agents there had expressed concerns about the conditions to their supervisors.
The agent who spent June in McAllen doesn’t see his reality in any of those depictions. He’s in his late 30s and is a husband and father who served overseas in the military before joining the Border Patrol. He asked not to be identified because he worried that his candor could cost him his job and thrust him and his family into the middle of the angry public debate over the Trump administration’s border policies.


His comments come at a particularly fraught moment, as politicians on the left compare the Border Patrol’s detention facilities to “concentration camps” and senior Trump administration officials, including most recently Vice President Mike Pence, dismiss descriptions of the inhumane conditions as “unsubstantiated.”
When asked about Pence’s comments, the agent said the damning descriptions of the facilities are “more substantiated than not.” And, while he didn’t embrace the term concentration camp, he didn’t dispute it either. He searched out loud for a term that might be more accurate. Gulag felt too strong. Jail didn’t feel strong enough.
He came around to this: “It’s kind of like torture in the army. It starts out with just sleep deprivation, then the next guys come in and sleep deprivation is normal, so they ramp it up. Then the next guys ramp it up some more, and then the next guys, until you have full blown torture going on. That becomes the new normal.”
Referring back to the grim conditions inside the Border Patrol holding centers, he said: “Somewhere down the line people just accepted what’s going on as normal. That includes the people responsible for fixing the problems.”
He spoke at length in several interviews, making clear that the views and motivations he articulated were his alone. He said he’s not on Facebook, much less a member of any secret Border Patrol social media groups. He also said he did not witness any egregious behavior by his colleagues during his time in McAllen. But he said the agents who were permanently posted there had the shortest fuses, and he’d heard them launch into condescending harangues at the young migrants, blaming them for crossing the border illegally and denying their requests for extra food, water or information about when they’d be released.
Most of his colleagues, he said, fall into one of two camps. There are the “law-and-order types” who see the immigrants in their custody, as, first and foremost, criminals. Then, he said, there are those who are “just tired of all the chaos” of a broken immigration system and “see no end in sight.”
“The only possible end to this that I see is if there’s some change after the next election,” he said, referring to what might finally end the stalemate in Washington over how to reform the system. “Either this president will win again, and Congress will be forced to work with him. Or a new president will get elected and do things a different way.”
In addition to the interviews, the agent shared a journal entry about his time in McAllen, which he wrote in a tentative attempt to sort through what he described as the “roughest” experience of his career; a month that he said revealed a disturbing capacity for detachment.
“What happened to me in Texas is that I realized I had walled off my emotions so I could do my job without getting hurt,” he said. “I’d see kids crying because they want to see their dads, and I couldn’t console them because I had 500 to 600 other kids to watch over and make sure they’re not getting in trouble. All I could do was make sure they’re physically OK. I couldn’t let them see their fathers because that was against the rules.
“I might not like the rules,” he added. “I might think that what we’re doing wasn’t the correct way to hold children. But what was I going to do? Walk away? What difference would that make to anyone’s life but mine?”
When asked whether he simply stopped caring, he said: “Exactly, to a point that’s kind of dangerous. But once you do, you feel better.”
Part of that feeling, the agent said, comes from experience. He’s served Republican and Democratic administrations, each one with its own border crisis and wildly unpopular responses. Other people might find it hard to view his agency outside the context of their political leanings, but he said that he didn’t join because he feels strongly one way or the other. He has a criminal justice degree and was looking for a federal law enforcement job that would provide him financial security, without requiring him to go overseas.
What keeps him in now, even as his job has morphed into one he and his wife are uncomfortable talking about in public, is that he earns about $100,000 a year, including overtime and holiday pay. He has a top-of-the-line health insurance plan that, among other things, covered nearly the entire cost of his child’s birth. In a little more than a decade, when he turns 51, he’ll be eligible to retire with a full pension that probably won’t cover the cost of a house on the beach, he said, but will give him the freedom to “do just about anything else I want, and not have to worry.”
The agent, tall and fit with dirty blond hair, said he thinks of his time left in the Border Patrol like the home stretch of a marathon. He does his work with blinders on to everything but his family and the finish line. “I’m already starting to attend retirement seminars,” he said. “All I’m trying to do is get through the next decade.”
That was his mindset, he said, when he landed in McAllen. It was his first time on the border since he was a rookie. He’d spent most of his career posted in the eastern part of the United States, investigating smuggling organizations rather than intercepting undocumented immigrants. But as huge numbers of Central American migrants came to the Rio Grande Valley, he and hundreds of agents across the country were summoned to help.
In his journal entry, the agent described what he saw when he arrived at the Border Patrol detention center as a “scene from a zombie apocalypse movie.”
His colleagues, he said, wore surgical masks and rubber gloves because there was “sickness and filth everywhere.” And he said the facility “looked like a walled-off compound where the government had the last safe zone and was taking in refugees fleeing the deadly zombie virus.”
The scene that struck the agent the hardest that first day was the sight of dozens of children being held in cages — an image publicized this year to widespread condemnation. The children seemed about the same age as his 2-year-old son, but that’s where the similarities ended. “My kid would have been running laps around that entire building, nonstop,” the agent said. “But the boys my kid’s age, they were just there. They weren’t running or playing, even though they had been pent up all day.”
The agent said he suspected that the kids were lethargic because they hadn’t been given enough to eat. He said he wondered, “Why are things like this?” He said he didn’t look for answers because he didn’t expect he’d find any. “I decided not to dwell on it, and just do my job.”
He went on that way for weeks, seeing things without dwelling on them. His interactions with individual immigrants, he said, are a blur. He vaguely recalled a government staffer combing lice out of a little girl’s hair; 7- and 8-year-olds pacing in circles and sobbing inconsolably because they’d been separated from their parents; a teenage mother who’d swaddled her baby in a filthy sweatshirt that she’d borrowed from another detainee because she’d been forced to throw away the clothes she brought.
Only a few of those encounters are mentioned in the agent’s written account of his experiences in McAllen. Most of it reads like a chronicle of a mundane work trip. He got Memorial Day off. He bought groceries and stopped drinking soda. A colleague who was staying at the Residence Inn shared enough free gym passes to last the entire trip, and his waist size went from 33 inches to 32. He started listening to music again: “Not a specific style, language or rhythm rather music that expressed passion.” And he tried meditation.
The visit by the team of lawyers to the facility near the end of June seemed to shake up the agent. The team, led by a California attorney named Hope Frye, had arrived to interview children being detained in McAllen. The agent’s duties placed him close enough to them to observe their work.
Frye said that typically during such visits, the agents tend to blend into the background; silent and straight-faced, in their badges and drab green uniforms. They didn’t engage much with her because they were instructed not to. She said years of hearing immigrant children tell her how badly they’d been treated in detention had long made her worry about the agents’ humanity. “I’ll look at them and wonder sometimes, ‘What kind of a parent are you when you spend your entire day filled with hate and victimizing other people?’”
But to get her work done, Frye said, she tries to keep such thoughts to herself. At some point in McAllen, however, she let a comment slip to the agent about a young child who had been separated from his family. The agent, she said, blurted out that he knew of another woman who was separated from her family and raising a 2-year-old on her own.
Frye, 68, said she asked the agent if he was referring to his own family. Her question started a series of exchanges that didn’t diminish her suspicions about the Border Patrol, Frye said, but did change her thinking a bit about the agent.
“If what happened was a film, you’d see an older woman with many years of experience, her eyes lined from seeing these poor children, and a young man, with a young family, seeing this nightmare for the first time,” Frye said, recalling her encounter with the agent. “What I thought to myself was, ‘How sad is it that this young man who probably wants to be of service to his country is stuck doing this.’”
Referring to the agent’s initial outburst, she said, “I think he was trying to tell me, ‘Hey, I’m human too.’”
Katherine Hagan, a Spanish interpreter who worked alongside Frye, also interacted briefly with the agent, and, although he didn’t say it in so many words, she felt he was struggling to reckon with his role at the facility, as if, she said, “he had become so accustomed to seeing children behind wire cages that he had assimilated it as normal and necessary.”
At one moment, she said, she recalled him scrambling to find clothes for the baby girl wrapped in the sweatshirt. The baby was so dirty that Frye wiped away rings of black dirt from around her neck. But at another point the agent lectured Hagan about indulging the immigrant children, warning her not to let “the aliens” use the officers’ bathrooms.
“I’m trying to find the right words to describe his demeanor,” Hagan, a graduate of the Harvard Divinity School, said of the agent. “I could tell he felt embarrassed and potentially kind of exposed. I don’t know whether he was having some kind of epiphany. But it was clear he knew that I saw him — really saw him — in the middle of this horrible situation.”
When asked about the interactions, the agent said he was trying to communicate to the lawyers that the detainees were not the only ones at the facility who felt trapped. Walking away, at least in his mind, was not an option. Trying to change things on “a macro level,” the agent said, was for fools.
“The most I felt I could do was make sure toilet paper was stocked. Or if someone wanted an extra juice, I’d give them an extra juice. Or maybe do something to make someone’s day a little nicer; maybe smile and treat them with respect. That’s all I felt I had the power to do,” the agent said. “The ones that try to save the world, they’re the ones who either get burned out or put on a leash.”
The agent compared himself to the cynical donkey in George Orwell’s “Animal Farm” who survives by never sticking his neck out.
“I’ve decided that I’m not interested in advancement,” he said. “I’d rather be a full-time father than a full-time Border Patrol agent.”
But now that he’s home, he feels the experience has somehow followed him.
“I go to the playground with my kid, and I say to myself, ‘Why am I not enjoying this?’”

313,‘You Can’t Find Them With a Searchlight’: Few Republicans Condemn Trump’s Racist Tweets,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/you-cant-find-them-with-a-searchlight-few-republicans-condemn-trumps-racist-tweets/,"After two days of tweets roundly condemned as xenophobic and racist, few Republicans or conservatives have spoken out against Donald Trump’s behavior.
Trump posted tweets Sunday telling a group of non-white Democratic congresswomen to “go back” their own countries. All of those lawmakers are Americans, and all but one were born in the United States.
Trump the next day doubled down and said that the lawmakers should apologize to him.

Charlie Sykes, a regular conservative Trump critic, referred to Trump’s tweets as “raw, industrial-strength racism.”
In an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash) said Trump’s rhetoric hurt immigrant families nationwide.
“First of all, Anderson, I think all of us are attacked personally in someway because he said ‘Progressive Democrat congresswomen,’ it was clear he was talking about those four but I will tell you I got calls today from friends of mine who are naturalized citizens, Americans who have been in this country for many years who said, ‘I don’t know what to tell my children.’
“They see the president saying terrible things about their parents and therefore about them and I think the impact of his words are deeply felt across the country and they are also felt by people who remember their own connections to their immigrant” experience, Jayapal added.
In a separate on-air appearance with CNN host Don Lemon, former Ohio governor and congressman John Kasich criticized pastors not speaking out.
“I don’t understand it. You know, Don, I served in Congress where things were not tolerated. As a group and maybe if they are afraid, why don’t they get a group of people together. If you work in a group to say enough of this then you have strengthen the group. Honestly I am flabbergasted of these preachers,” Kasich said. “They get up on Sunday and they preach love and forgiveness and when this happens, you can’t find them with a search light. You don’t know where they are. We got a judge, look at what’s happening the fabric of the country. Another thing — I don’t tolerate this kind of name calling from anyone including the Democrats. You call names, you call vicious names of the president, I am against what you are doing, too. This is the president. This is the president of the United States saying these, ‘go back to where you came from.’ It is unbelievable.”
Rep. Will Hurd of Texas was one of the few Republicans to criticize Trump’s tweets.

“I think those tweets are racist and xenophobic, and they’re also inaccurate. The four women he’s referring to are actually citizens of the United States. Three of the four were born here. It’s also behavior that is unbecoming of the leader of the free world,” Hurd said. “You should be talking about things that unite us, not divide us. And also, I think politically, it doesn’t help. While you had a civil war going on within the Democratic Party between the far left and the rest of the party, now they have circled the wagons and are starting to protect one another. We can disagree without being disagreeable. I don’t agree with many of the things that they’re talking about or proposals that they’re putting forward. But that’s where the debate should be on, not these other issues.”
The debate spilled out on the airwaves of the popular daytime talk show, The View, where prominent Republican Meghan McCain called others in her party “cowardly” for not speaking out.

314,"Trump Blasted for Racist Tweets; Republican Suggests Sending Rubio, Cruz, Melania Back to Their Home Countries",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trump-blasted-for-racist-tweets-republican-suggests-sending-rubio-cruz-melania-back-to-their-home-countries/,"Although he was roundly condemned as openly racist for tweets suggesting that a group of non-white congresswomen “go back to their own countries,” Trump only fueled the fire with more such messages Monday.
The controversy began Sunday when Trump injected himself into a Democratic feud between a group of first-year progressive House Democrats and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. However, he did so with tweets many worldwide considered openly racist.
Trump told the women to “go back to their countries.” Only one of whom–Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota–was not born in the United States. She arrived as a refugee in childhood.
Although Trump received worldwide condemnation, he followed up with a demand that the lawmakers be the ones to apologize.
Democratic presidential candidates, such as Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders, defended the lawmakers.
“As a son of immigrants myself, I know when someone says to go home in my case I was born in upstate New York, it’s the opposite of what we need from our president to try to call out these false distinctions between different types of people,” said Yang. “We’re all Americans. These are members of Congress born in this country this is the opposite of whast president should be saying.”
Sanders praised the work of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and her colleagues for the work that they are doing.
“And what Alexandria and other young women and women of color are saying, ‘We have got to reach out to young people. We have got to heal the pain of the working class of this country.’ And that is causing some political disruption within the leadership of the Democratic Party. And let me give you one example where I am very concerned. I have helped lead the effort to expand community health centers in this country. Right now there’s legislation in the house, the democratic house, to cut community health centers by 20 percent. Unacceptable.
“So I support Alexandria’s and the other women’s desire to bring more people, especially young people, working class people, into the Democratic Party,” he added. “That is the future of the Democratic Party.”
A prominent Never Trumper Republican strongly denounced the president’s tweets as racist and called on other Republicans to do the same.
“Look, Republicans have neglected their responsibility when it comes to Donald Trump for three years now, and I don’t think that will change because of this horrible tweet. But frankly, Republicans should be speaking out against this,” said Ana Navarro. “Republicans should be calling this what it is. Call a spade a spade. Call a racist a racist. The problem is that they’ve enabled this racist for far too long, they’ve justified this racist for far too long. They’ve kissed his ring far too long. They are afraid of this racist. So they just look the other way and play dumb, but it really is a very bad look for the entire Republican Party.
“Kamala Harris is right. I can tell you I get it all the time, ‘Go back to your country.’ Well, I’ve got news for Donald Trump and all of his supporters who feel the same way. This is our country!” Navarro added. “It is our country as much as it is Trump’s country. If we’re going to start sending people back, I don’t know. Listen, Ted Cruz was born in Canada. Marco Rubio’s parents were born in Cuba. Melania Trump was born where, Slovenia? How about her parents who are here through family immigration?
“I’m sick of this guy’s hypocrisy and his ways of dividing this country, pitting people against each other,” she said. “And I think it is no coincidence, It is no coincidence that the congresspeople he is picking on are all women of color. Are all women of color!”

315,"Border Patrol Condemns Secret Facebook Group, but Reveals Few Specifics",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/border-patrol-condemns-secret-facebook-group-but-reveals-few-specifics/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
Long known for its insular culture and tendency toward secrecy, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency is saying little in the aftermath of news reports exposing a vulgar and hateful Facebook group for current and retired Border Patrol agents, including supervisors.
While CBP officials have publicly condemned the offensive social media posts, they’ve disclosed few details about the steps the agency has taken to identify employees who behaved inappropriately online and hold them accountable.
The agency, which is responsible for policing the nation’s borders and official ports of entry, declined to say how many employees CBP has disciplined or how many remain under investigation.
In response to questions from ProPublica, a CBP spokesperson would only say that “several” employees had been placed on restricted duty as a result of postings in the three-year-old Facebook group, and that so far no one had been suspended from the patrol, a more serious disciplinary action. The agency would not say whether the agents now on restricted duty are allowed to have contact with the public, and it refused to answer questions about specific agents who appear to have made posts celebrating sexual violence and demeaning migrants and women.
The “majority of employees who have been positively identified” as being active in the Facebook group have been issued letters instructing them stop posting objectionable material, said the spokesperson, who declined to specify how many people had received the letters, described as “cease and desist” notices.


“This secrecy is unacceptable,” said Joaquin Castro, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and representative for San Antonio. “This secrecy is dangerous to human life. CBP is perhaps the least transparent law enforcement agency in the country.”
ProPublica last week revealed the existence of the secret 9,500-member Facebook group, called “I’m 10-15,” a reference to the Border Patrol code for “alien in custody.” In the private group, current and former Border Patrol agents, including supervisors, mocked dead migrants, called congresswomen “scum buckets,” and uploaded misogynistic images, including an illustration of New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a harsh critic of CBP, engaged in oral sex with a migrant in a detention facility. A later story by The Intercept published additional graphic posts from the group and information about its members.
CBP policies bar employees from making “abusive, derisive, profane, or harassing statements or gestures” about any person or group on private or public social media.
Among those who apparently made egregious posts is Thomas Hendricks, a 20-year veteran of the Border Patrol who serves as a supervisor of the Calexico station, a desert outpost in Southern California’s Imperial County. Hendricks — or someone using his Facebook account — uploaded a photo illustration of President Donald Trump forcing the head of Ocasio-Cortez toward his crotch. The image was accompanied by a cryptic message that appeared to refer to prior issues within the patrol: “That’s right bitches. The masses have spoken and today democracy won. I have returned.”
Hendricks did not respond to requests for comment from ProPublica.
An agent at the Alamogordo station in New Mexico, Mario Marcus Ponce, apparently described Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Veronica Escobar of El Paso, Texas, both Democrats, as “hoes” in a discussion in the Facebook group. Ponce did not answer calls and text messages from ProPublica.
CBP would not discuss the current status of Hendricks and Ponce or two other agents identified by ProPublica. “We cannot comment on individual cases,” the CBP spokesperson said.
Unlike many big city police departments, the Border Patrol generally divulges little information about agents found to have engaged in misconduct or those involved in shooting incidents. At times, the agency has refused even to reveal the names of agents facing trial on criminal corruption charges.
“They are not used to being questioned. They are not used to be scrutinized,” said Josiah Heyman, an anthropologist at the University of Texas at El Paso who has been studying the border since 1982.
The Facebook group, he said, is “an indicator of broader problems” within the Border Patrol. “There is an attitude within CBP and Border Patrol that everybody crossing the border is invading the United States and coming to do bad things,” he said.
While Heyman noted that there is little solid statistical data on the views held by Border Patrol agents, he pointed to a survey of approximately 1,100 migrants who’d been deported to Mexico. Nearly a quarter of the respondents said they’d been verbally abused by U.S. government employees, primarily Border Patrol. “It is an enormous number,” said Heyman, director of the school’s Center for Inter-American and Border Studies.
In a statement issued last week, Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost said the Facebook images and comments aren’t representative of the patrol as a whole. “These posts are completely inappropriate and contrary to the honor and integrity I see—and expect—from our agents day in and day out,” she said. “Any employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable.”
At least two oversight bodies are now looking into the conduct of Border Patrol agents on social media. One inquiry is being led by CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility, essentially an internal affairs unit staffed with professional investigators.
In Congress, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, led by Maryland Democrat Elijah Cummings has opened an investigation and committee staffers are currently gathering facts. Cummings has requested that Kevin McAleenan, the acting chief of the Department of Homeland Security — CBP’s parent organization — testify before the committee this week about “racist, sexist, and xenophobic posts by Border Patrol agents,” as well as reports of inhumane conditions and severe overcrowding at CBP detention facilities.
The congressman has also instructed Facebook to turn over digital evidence related to the group. “The Committee requests that you preserve all documents, communications, and other data related to the ‘I’m 10-15’ group. This includes log files and metadata,” Cummings wrote in a letter to Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg.
At the House Homeland Security Committee, chair Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, has called on the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security to mount an investigation into the Facebook group.
The inspector general’s office would not comment on whether it has opened an inquiry.
For his part, Castro said he intends to ask some questions of his own. “I am going to set up a call with Secretary McAleenan to have a conversation about the discipline and accountability process within DHS,” Castro, a Democrat, said. “I don’t know if there is any accountability. I don’t know if there is any discipline.”

316,Biden’s Pivot to Foreign Policy,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/bidens-pivot-to-foreign-policy/,"I suspect Joe Biden’s looking beyond the primaries to the general presidential election now: after all, the primaries are just the first step to becoming president. More than that, Biden has experience of working in the White House, and he knows the importance of maintaining effective foreign policy — something Donald Trump seems incapable of.
Let’s be honest: this is one area that Biden can excel in, because he has considerably more experience than most of the other Democratic candidates.
I also have a sneaky suspicion that part of the reasons behind it are because of the issue with the British Ambassador’s private communiques being leaked, placing Trump in a rather negative light (referring to him as ‘inept’). Trump’s natural response to this was to throw a tantrum that ultimately pressured the Ambassador into resigning — something which simply should not have happened.

Biden’s well aware that Trump not only demonstrated a serious lack of political experience here (since most of those that have it would be aware that an Ambassador is paid to tell the truth about the nation they’re assigned to, even if that commentary isn’t flattering), but also highlighting that it could have been handled far better — and that Biden would have done this. His remarks make it clear that he agreed with the Ambassador on this:
“The world sees Trump for what he is: insincere, ill-informed, and impulsive. Sometimes corrupt. Dangerously incompetent, and incapable, in my view, of world leadership and leadership at home.”
It’s also a way of observing to foreign allies that Americans also noticed the same things that the Ambassador picked up on, and that they’re not alone in thinking of Trump as incompetent.
For Biden, this is where he gets to showcase his experience, his understanding of international politics, and to make it clear to the American people that he has a very different vision of how the US should engage with other nations: as a leader, not as a bully or as a toddler throwing a tantrum.
It’s a smart move to position himself this way: he makes it clear that he’s looking beyond the Democratic nomination (and indeed, the party), starts pushing for a foreign policy platform that runs counter to the Trump administration’s approach, and reminds the American people that there’s a better way.

317,"Bill Weld: I Can Win the New Hampshire Primary, Which Would Fatally Wound Trump Politically",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/bill-weld-i-can-win-the-new-hampshire-primary-which-would-fatally-wound-trump-politically/,"Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld has opened up on what a strategy might look like for his quixotic run to deny Donald Trump renomination as the Republican presidential candidate.
Weld, who was a popular GOP governor in the 1990s, is the only declared Republican candidate seeking to deny Trump a second term.
Weld, who ran for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016, sees a place for former Republican Justin Amash to run for president with that party this year.

“I see that I can win the New Hampshire primary, which would fatally wound Mr. Trump politically. There’s plenty of historical precedent for that,” Weld said. “I was around when Pat Buchanan fatally wounded George H.W. Bush with only 37 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary. And I was riding around with President Bush. I was on his side, of course, not Pat Buchanan’s side.
“It’s happened five times since the modern New Hampshire primary that a sitting president was running for re-election faced a primary even if he didn’t lose the primary, lost the general election,” Weld added. “And I think it’s important that Mr. Trump not repeat as president of the United States. We can’t afford five and a half, six more years of this guy. So I’m running to win. I think I can win. I think I’m qualified to take the job starting Monday. But meanwhile, I’m going to do what I can to lessen the odds in Mr. Trump’s favor.”
Meanwhile, Weld also encouraged Amash to run for president as a Libertarian. Amash is the Michigan congressman who ultimately left the Republican Party after becoming the lone Republican to call for Trump’s impeachment.
“I would encourage Mr. Amash. I think that would be a good move for him and good move for the United States,” Weld said. “Because as you know, I think Mr. Trump is a threat to our democratic institutions and the Bill of Rights. So the more votes that comes out of his pockets, the better I like it.”

318,Rep. Al Green: ‘I Want to Ensure All that Impeachment Is Not Dead’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/rep-al-green-i-want-to-ensure-all-that-impeachment-is-not-dead/,"A leading advocate for the impeachment of Donald Trump spoke this week on the House floor to keep the impeachment option alive.
In his floor remarks, Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.) called impeachment “a vote of conscience.”
Although a growing number of rank-and-file Democrats have embraced impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team have steadfastly refused to move forward that.
“This means that you vote based upon what your conscience dictates. There will be no instructions given to persons who will vote. Generally speaking, a jury would receive some sort of instructions indicating that you should make certain findings. No instructions. There will be no indication that you have to do this based upon clear and convincing evidence. That you have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that something occurred,” Green said. “That you should do it by a preponderance of the evidence. There is no standard that will be given to members as they cast their ballots. It is something that each member does and it is a vote of conscience. Now, the question can become whose conscience will it be?

“Because if you take another person’s recommendation and you vote based upon that recommendation, then you could conceivably vote another person’s conscience. I will vote my conscience,” Green added. “I will not be guided by what others think, who may be voting based upon political expediency. You can vote based upon political expediency if you so choose. I will vote based upon a moral imperative. A moral imperative.”

319,Pelosi on ICE Raids: Trump’s ‘Terrorizing’ Families as ‘They Prepare To Go to Church’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/pelosi-on-ice-raids-trumps-terrorizing-families-as-they-prepare-to-go-to-church/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Trump administration officials of timing upcoming raids of immigrant communities to fall as they will be preparing for Sunday church.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been directed to conduct raids Sunday targeting recently arrived migrant families who have orders to leave the country.

“It’s about values that the president does not seem to share. And we saw this morning when he announced his heartless raids on families this coming Sunday. When he announced this before, I called some people of faith about this, evangelicals who support the president for other reasons, but who have been good on immigration issues, usually. And basically, they were very concerned that this goes too far,” Pelosi said. “Because these raids were not what they signed up for with President Trump. And I think their calls to the president made a difference. Basically what they said to me is, on Sunday — this is the Hispanic evangelicals — on Sunday, west of the Mississippi, our people are are in church.
“And as they prepare to go to church, they feel very threatened and scared by these raids,” she added. “So hopefully the president will think again about it or these groups will weigh in once again.”

320,Sen. Coons on U.K. Ambassador Resignation: ‘This Latest Flap Has Further Accelerated’ Distance Between Us,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/__trashed-3/,"U.K. Ambassador Kim Darroch’s resignation Wednesday will be a further deterioration of the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom under Donald Trump’s leadership, according to a senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Darroch’s resignation followed a number of tirades against him by Trump after several diplomatic cables were made public in which Darroch provided an unvarnished–and unflattering–view of Trump for his superiors back in London.
“I know Sir Kim Darroch well. He has served the United Kingdom extremely well as their ambassador here in our nation’s capital. And every country sends ambassadors overseas in part so that they can send back open, clear eyed, blunt assessments of how that other country views them and how it’s functioning. And the leak of this confidential cable has produced an unfortunate flap that has now led to the resignation of a very skilled career foreign servant,” said Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware. “I will point out part of what drove this was President Trump taking to Twitter to insult the ambassador, to insult Theresa May, the outgoing prime minister of the United Kingdom. We have long enjoyed a close and special relationship with the U.K. that is rooted in our shared values as well as our interests and I think it’s unfortunate that this latest flap has further accelerated some of the distance between us.

“They will choose a new prime minister in just a few weeks. And in any event there almost certainly would have been a new ambassador posted at that point,” Coons added. “So I think Sir Kim has done, you know, what was the right thing from a career perspective. I will be sad to see him go.”

321,The Oil Industry In An Electric Future,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/the-oil-industry-in-an-electric-future/,"As more electric vehicles (EVs) begin to take hold in the marketplace, there will continue to be a glut of oil and natural gas, oil prices will continue to be depressed (regardless of attempts by OPEC to constrain production.) Oil sands production will continue to be pulled back, and the new pipelines will struggle to stay full.
In the longer term, I see the following:
Petro companies consider themselves energy companies, and many are already making significant investments in renewables. As EVs start to really take over, oil and gas will start to tank (see what I did there?)
This process will take place over a period of about 20 to 25 years as renewables make significant penetration worldwide. Coal is already toast. Dirty oil is next. Some pipeline companies will go bankrupt, and oil companies will scramble to convert their huge investments into renewables.
EVs will take over from conventional, internal combustion engine vehicles. Diesel will be the last to go. Gas stations will either change or disappear. Oil companies will sell off their stations to independents who can eek out the last bit of profitability in gas stations.
More importantly, as this happens, the new energy companies will buy up legacy electric utility companies and convert to new forms of micro-generation plants and local battery storage. The national energy grid will be completely transformed.

322,McConnell Challenger: ‘Folks Like Sen. McConnell Who Have Been Around for 34 Years Are Not the Answer’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/mcconnell-challenger-folks-like-sen-mcconnell-who-have-been-around-for-34-years-are-not-the-answer/,"Amy McGrath, the Democrat who just announced that she will be taking on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) in next year’s elections, is positioning herself uniquely in a red state which Donald Trump won by some 30 points in 2016.
It is McConnell who is standing in the way of a number of promises Trump made to Kentuckians four years ago, said McGrath, who ran but fell just short in an election for a House seat last year from the Bluegrass State.
“I think if you think about why Kentuckians voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, Donald Trump promised to drain the swamp, bring back jobs, do big things in infrastructure, do things like bring down drug prices, and a lot of these things are being halted by Sen. McConnell,” said McGrath, a veteran military fighter jet pilot. “For example, drug prices. President Trump has said this is his priority. He said the current system is very, very unfair and this is important for Kentucky. Kentucky has the second highest per capita spending on prescription drug medication. Over $2,000 a year. And who is stopping President Trump from doing this? Senator McConnell. Because he’s bought off by Big Pharma. He gets $1.2 million in campaign cash in his last election, it’s not rocket science. This is what’s happening and a lot of Kentuckians know this.”
McGrath raised $2.5 million in 24 hours to fund her campaign against McConnell.

323,Schumer on Epstein: ‘I Am Calling on Secretary Acosta to Resign’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/schumer-on-epstein-i-am-calling-on-secretary-acosta-to-resign/,"The top Senate Democrat is calling on Labor Secretary Alex Acosta to resign, for his role more than a decade ago in a “non-prosecution” agreement for wealthy socialite Jeffrey Epstein.
Epstein, 66, was arrested this week for soliciting sex from underage women and girls. He is charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and sex trafficking. He faces potentially up to 45 years in prison.
However, Epstein was charged with similar crimes before, back in 2008. At that time, the federal prosecutor, for reasons unknown, let Epstein off with minimal jail time. And, in violation of law, that prosecutor failed to notify Epstein’s victim’s of the deal.
The prosecutor in that case was Alex Acosta, who today serves as labor secretary in the Trump administration.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) went to the Senate floor to call for Acosta to step down, for his role in giving this sex offender such a sweetheart deal.
“The newly released evidence of Epstein’s behavior involving dozens of children is sickening, is appalling, is despicable. Epstein should have been behind bars years ago, but unfortunately Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta cut Epstein a sweetheart deal while Acosta was a U.S. Attorney in Florida in 2008,” Schumer said. “While a federal prosecutor, Acosta signed a non-prosecution agreement that allowed Epstein and his co-conspirators to remain free and evade justice despite overwhelming evidence. Mr. Acosta hid this agreement from Epstein’s victims. No one can figure out why Mr. Epstein was able to persuade U.S. Attorney Acosta not to prosecute other than that Epstein could afford high-powered, high-priced attorneys. As The Miami Herald editorial board wrote this morning, it was not just that Acosta failed to get it right in 2008. The evidence suggests he didn’t care to.

“Accordingly, I’m asking three things: First, I am calling on Secretary Acosta to resign. It is now impossible for anyone to have confidence in Secretary Acosta’s ability to lead the Department of Labor,” Schumer added. “If he refuses to resign, President Trump should fire him. Instead of prosecuting a predator and serial sex trafficker of children, Acosta chose to let him off easy. This is not acceptable. We cannot have, as one of the leading appointed officials in America, someone who has done this, plain and simple. Second, I am calling on the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility to make public the results of its review of Acosta’s handling of the Epstein case. Sens. [Patty] Murray [D-Wash.] and [Tim] Kaine [D-Va.] have called for these findings, but the Justice Department so far has stonewalled, has refused to make them public. This review cannot be kept in the dark, particularly given the new revelations, and there should be hearings. And third, the president needs to answer for his statements he has made about his relationship with Mr. Epstein. In 2002, he said he’d known Epstein for 15 years and he was ‘a terrific guy’ who enjoyed women ‘on the younger side.’ Epstein was also reportedly a regular at the Mar-a-Lago club for years. The president needs to answer for this, and ‘I don’t recall’ is not an acceptable answer in this case, particularly since President Trump appointed Mr. Acosta to such a powerful position.”
There is no indication that Trump will fire Acosta, as Trump said that Acosta is doing a “fantastic job” as labor secretary.

324,First Judicial Subpoenas Served in Emoluments Lawsuit Brought by More Than 200 Lawmakers,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/first-judicial-subpoenas-served-in-emoluments-lawsuit-brought-by-more-than-200-lawmakers/,"After Judge Emmet Sullivan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling allowing Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), and more than 200 congressional plaintiffs to proceed with discovery in their effort to hold President Trump accountable for alleged violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution, 37 judicial subpoenas were issued to a number of Trump business enterprises, including the Trump Organization, seeking information about foreign government payments accepted by six Trump properties, as well as trademarks granted to Trump businesses by foreign governments.
In a ruling rejecting Trump’s attempts to delay discovery in the case, Judge Sullivan recognized that discovery and summary judgment briefing in the case can be complete by early next year.
In response, members of Congress said that they moved swiftly in serving targeted document requests for financial documents necessary to prove the allegations in the complaint that Trump is violating the Foreign Emoluments Clause, including corporate tax returns. The members of Congress are represented in this case by the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive think tank and law firm.

The Foreign Emoluments Clause holds that no officer of the federal government, including the president, may receive gifts or payments of value from foreign sources.
Because Trump never formally severed himself from his for-profit business ventures before being sworn in, his Washington Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House is a prime source where the president can be collecting emoluments, as discovered by The Washington Post.
“Our goal is simple and straightforward – stopping President Trump from putting a ‘For Sale’ sign in Russian on the door to the Oval Office. Now that we have been rightfully granted the opportunity to proceed with discovery, we are seeking a targeted set of documents to obtain the information that we need to ensure that the President can no longer shirk his constitutional responsibility,” Blumenthal said. “Thanks to the good work of the press, we already know of foreign emoluments that President Trump has and is receiving – we simply don’t yet know the full scope of his lawbreaking. Unsurprisingly, the Trump Administration is still seeking to delay, delay, delay, but we are confident that the D.C. Circuit will recognize the well-reasoned logic of the District Court, and allow discovery to proceed.”

325,"Debate Live Dial Results Find Voters Want Action on Serious Issues, Not an Anti-Trump Campaign",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/debate-live-dial-results-find-voters-want-action-on-serious-issues-not-an-anti-trump-campaign/,"Results from a focus group using live-dial measurements during the recent Democratic presidential debate found voters are looking for movement in several key issue areas–not merely a campaign against incumbent Donald Trump.
The results, released Monday by the Washington non-profit Democracy Corps, also found that Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris were the winners of their respective nights of the two-night debate event in Miami, Fla.,
all but three of the 20 candidates on stage increased their net favorabilty among those surveyed and Democrats performed well among the so-called rising American electorate, white working-class women, and white college-educated women — all proven to be important demographic groups for Democrats going into 2020, according to materials released to announce the results of the focus group test.

Although Warren and Harris won their respective evenings, they still received less support overall than long-time front-runner, former vice president Joe Biden, the results found.
This was a debate where voters said their most important issues were health care and drug costs, climate change, and getting immigration under control. The motivation is not about getting Trump out of office – that is lower on the priorities and didn’t rise in the either night’s post survey, the live-dial results found.
Democracy Corps, founded in 1999 by Democratic strategist James Carville and Stan Greenberg, conducted live dial-meter testing of the June 26 and 27 Democratic presidential primary debates among the rising American electorate (African Americans, Latinos, white unmarried women, and white millennials), white working-class women and men, and white college women.
Data charts in PDF format from the focus group can be downloaded here.

326,Appeals Court Blocks Trump’s Border Wall in Emergency Declaration Challenge,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/appeals-court-blocks-trumps-border-wall-in-emergency-declaration-challenge/,"A federal appeals court last week denied the government’s attempt to begin construction of President Trump’s border wall using funds unauthorized by Congress. The ruling upholds two earlier district court orders that together permanently block the administration from building wall sections along the southern border in New Mexico, Arizona and California using $2.5 billion in diverted military funds.
The court issued its decision just prior to the long July 4 holiday weekend.
Trump earlier this year declared a so-called “national emergency” as a means to bypass Congress and raid existing military budgets to build the wall he and his supporters have long wanted along the southern border of the United States.
“Congress and now two courts have said no to border wall funds. For the sake of our democracy and border communities, it’s time the president come to terms with the fact that America rejected his xenophobic wall — and move on,” said Dror Ladin, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project,who argued the case before the appeals court.

The ruling comes in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU on behalf of the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition (SBCC) challenging the president’s abuse of emergency powers to secure border wall funds Congress denied.
“Today’s Ninth Circuit ruling upholds the basic notion that only Congress can appropriate funds,” said Gloria Smith, managing attorney at the Sierra Club. “We’ve seen the damage that the ever-expanding border wall has inflicted on communities and the environment for decades. Walls divide neighborhoods, worsen dangerous flooding, destroy lands and wildlife, and waste resources that should instead be used on the infrastructure border communities truly need.”
The ACLU, Sierra Club, and SBCC’s lawsuit argues the president is usurping Congress’s appropriations power and violating the clearly defined separation of powers inscribed in the Constitution. The border wall project — if carried out as directed under the president’s emergency proclamation — would cause irreparable harm to the environment and communities living at the border.
“We are pleased to see the court uphold the foundation of our democracy by denying the Trump Administration’s appeal,” said Vicki Gaubeca, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition. “President Trump’s overreach in attempting to build deadly and wasteful walls in our region — walls that greatly diminish public safety and our quality of life, walls that threaten our diverse wildlife — will not stand, and we will continue to fight for the southern border region.”
They Sierra Club and SBCC have members who live in, protect, and treasure the lands that the Trump administration has targeted for the construction, the plantiffs said.

327,Tlaib on Visit to Border Facility: ‘Literally Every Single Woman Confirmed’ They Were to Drink from Toilet,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/tlaib-on-visit-to-border-facility-literally-every-single-woman-confirmed-they-were-to-drink-from-toilet/,"Speaking about her visit to a federal detention facility where immigrants are being held, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (R-Mich) confirmed that they are being held in inhumane conditions.
“Literally every single woman confirmed what the one woman said, which is, ‘I asked for water,’ and they said,’Go drink it from the toilet.’ I think there were too many of us, I mean there was close to over 10 or 11 members of Congress, several of them were in the same cell unit where the 14 women or so was at. And then I was in another unit – area where the door they finally were able to open up the door for me to speak to a grandmother who has been there for 40 days and had not seen her grandson that she came with since then, who is also special needs.”
Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents admitted that the kinds of immigration detention they are performing at these facilities is not humane, Tlaib said.

“Three agents took me aside, away from my colleagues and said, ‘More money is not going to fix this,’ that they were not trained to separate children. That they don’t want to separate two-year-olds away from their mothers. That’s not what they were trained for, that’s not what they signed up for in their service to our country. They signed up to protect the border, not to separate children, not to put people in cages. They all said this is a broken system, this is inhumane.”
Those conditions led Tlaib have led Tlaib to agree with colleague Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to categorize these detention facilities as “concentration camps.”
“Absolutely, I mean there’s an number of experts that say this is – because it’s traumatic,” Tlaib said. “I mean I don’t know how to explain to people what we saw when we’re explaining to people and they’re kind of looking back and saying, ‘Well that can’t be true.’ I said, ‘But we were all there,’ I mean you have Congressman [Joaquin] Castro [D-Tex], Melanie, Norma, all of us were there.”

328,New York Is Investigating Whether Facebook Lets Advertisers Discriminate,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/new-york-is-investigating-whether-facebook-lets-advertisers-discriminate/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
New York state’s Department of Financial Services has launched an investigation into reports that advertisers can use Facebook’s targeted advertising tools to discriminate against protected groups of people.
The investigation, announced Monday, is the latest action against the social media company’s advertising system. In March, Facebook reached a settlement with civil rights groups and agreed to make sweeping changes to the ways landlords, employers and lenders buy housing, employment or credit ads. A week later, the Department of Housing and Urban Development charged Facebook with violating the Fair Housing Act, claiming that the ad system discriminates against certain types of users even when advertisers did not choose to exclude them from seeing ads.
In a press release July 1, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state’s investigation will explore both the tools available to advertisers and allegations that Facebook “uses machine learning and predictive analytics to categorize users to project each user’s likely response to a given ad, which may recreate groupings defined by their protected class.”


ProPublica first reported that Facebook allowed housing advertisers to exclude users by race in 2016. Then, in 2017, ProPublica returned to the issue and found that — despite Facebook’s promised changes — the company was still letting landlords exclude users by race, gender, ethnicity, family status, ability and other characteristics protected by federal anti-discrimination law.
In response to these lawsuits, Facebook has said it will create a new advertising portal specifically for advertisers buying housing, employment and credit ads, limiting the options available and removing more than 5,000 categories related to race, gender, national origin and age. These changes are to be completed by September 2019, according to a civil rights audit released this week.
In response to questions about New York’s investigation, a Facebooks spokesman pointed ProPublica to the civil rights audit. In a related blog post, COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote: “Our policies have always prohibited advertisers from using our tools to discriminate. In 2018, we went further by removing thousands of categories from targeting related to protected classes such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and religion. But we can do better.”
The civil rights audit also recommended stronger hate speech policies and stricter rules to prevent the spread of white supremacy on Facebook, a topic in the spotlight after ProPublica obtained offensive posts in a secret group for current and former Border Patrol agents. A Facebook spokesperson has refused to answer any questions about how it policed this group, citing a federal investigation.

329,"No, Trump Can’t Add Citizenship Question With Executive Order",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/no-trump-cant-add-citizenship-question-with-executive-order/,"Donald Trump might try to add the question he wants to the upcoming Census asking respondents about their citizenship, but no, it won’t hold up.
An executive order exists to inform federal agencies on how to enact the laws passed by Congress, or on how to act in a manner that matches the Constitution. In the latter instance, the Supreme Court is the sole authority that exists to determine whether something does or does not adhere to the intent behind the Constitution.
They’ve done that, and they ruled against Trump including such a question on the census.

If he attempts to invoke an executive order now to order the question included, it will likely be challenged in the courts, and the courts will sustain the objection and cancel the order, and the Census will be issued as it currently stands. One less thing for Trump to try and weaponise as a means to being re-elected.
Someone might want to let him know that the resources of the federal government don’t exist to keep him in office.

330,"Despite Jobs Rebound, Pelosi Laments Those ‘Still Struggling’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/despite-jobs-rebound-pelosi-laments-those-still-struggling/,"Although job growth in the US economy bounced back from its slump in May, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continued to rail against Donald Trump’s economic policies for leaving too many Americans behind.
The economy added a more-robust 224,000 jobs during June, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7 percent, still near a 50-year low.
However, signs are that the economic expansion is not reaching all Americans, as upwards of 40 percent say they are still struggling to pay their bills.
“The June job numbers are an improvement over May’s dreadful report, but hard-working Americans are still struggling under the Trump Administration’s disastrous special interest agenda,” Pelosi said in a prepared statement.

“As the cost of living soars, too many hard-working Americans are being forced to work multiple jobs just to provide for themselves and their families,” Pelosi added. “While the wealthy and well-connected have been further enriched by the GOP’s special interest giveaways, hard-working men and women earning the federal minimum wage are falling further and further behind.  Our economy must work for everyone, not just the wealthy and privileged few.”
Congressional Democrats are fighting for other priorities, Pelosi said.
“Our Democratic Majority is fighting For The People to lower the price of prescription drugs and protect people with pre-existing conditions, to raise wages by rebuilding America with green, modern, job-creating infrastructure, and to clean up corruption in Washington,” Pelosi’s statement said. “We will continue to work to deliver results for the American people on the issues that matter in their lives. By advancing bold legislation to protect the health and financial stability of American families, we will build a future of prosperity and opportunity for all.”

331,Presidential Historian Meacham: We Could Learn a Lot from the Dwight Eisenhower Era,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/presidential-historian-meacham-we-could-learn-a-lot-from-the-dwight-eisenhower-era/,"Contemporary US leaders, including Donald Trump, could learn a lot from how Dwight Eisenhower conducted his presidency during the 1950s, according to historian and author Jon Meacham.
“You have a Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 saying, ‘I’m not going to rip up the New Deal, it’s part of the fabric of the country,'” Meacham said. “That sets up an amazing run of prosperity, it helps set up the work of the civil rights movement. It helps set up our posture in the Cold War. And a peaceable posture. Not a single soldier died in combat under Dwight Eisenhower.
“And that is where he was asking a Republican Party to change its orthodoxy. And they didn’t like it, but they did it,” Meacham added. “And that’s an era we could go back to — that we can learn a lot from.”

For instance, current Republicans–rather than accept the Affordable Care Act approved under President Barack Obama–expended great effort to attempt to repeal the healthcare reform law, even in the face of rising public embrace of the reform law in recent years.
The Founders of the United States actually did anticipate a president like Trump when they established the federal government, Meacham said.
“I think that in some ways, this is what the Founders in many ways expected,” he said. “It would have stunned them that it took 243 years to get a demagogue as president. They would have been incredibly pleased with themselves. Now, they were thinking about Patrick Henry. They were thinking about Aaron Burr but when people say, ‘Oh, the Founders never anticipated Donald Trump,’ the hell they didn’t. It’s just wrong.”

332,Why Do Liberals Hate The United States?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/why-do-liberals-hate-the-united-states/,"Here’s a good question: Why do you hate the United States?
I’m serious.
Current polling data shows that more than 6 in 10 Americans do not approve of the job Donald Trump is doing and that about 57 percent actively disapprove. They dislike him so much that they make fun of him and say things like, “He’s not my president.”
Presidential Approval Ratings — Donald Trump
And you hate that.
But it’s America.
You want a wall built across the entirety of the southern border of the United States, no matter how much it costs, no matter how many times you’ve been shown it’s not a cost-effective solution to border security, you’d rather deride any other solution as “open borders” even though it’s not. Yet current polls show that 56 percent of Americans don’t want the wall.
Poll: Majorities oppose Trump’s wall funding demand, call for compromise
You want that wall so much. So you hate that.
But it’s America.

In America, people express themselves different ways, especially when they’re trying to get a point across. They even do things that make you really angry, like kneeling during the National Anthem, to make a point about the way young black men are treated during interactions with police. Sometimes it’s football players on your favorite football team, and it makes you so mad you can’t even enjoy football anymore.
Man, you hate that.
But even your favorite news network tells you that most Americans support their right to do so. Meaning it’s America. And you hate it.
Most Americans support NFL players’ right to kneel: Poll
You hate that people want to do things that don’t directly benefit you with the money you have to give the government out of your paycheck.
You hate that every day the meaning of the word equality seems to include more and more people, making you feel less and less in sole possession of the American Dream.
You hate that you have so few people anymore that it’s okay for you to feel superior to.
But it’s America.
I’ve been examining this odd idea that comes from the right that they have some kind of monopoly on patriotism for some time. The more I examine it, the more I see how little water it holds.
Liberals don’t hate America. Liberals love what America is and can be.
Conservatives wearing red hats with white writing love some strange perception they have of what it was at some point in the past.
In general, though, conservatives do love America. This is true.
But liberals do as well. The thing is, though, it’s a different kind of love.
Conservatives show their love of country with a sort of reverent respect, submission to ultimate authority, in a way that is best expressed by the phrase, “Love it or leave it” In other words, take her as she is, don’t try to change her.
As one loves a parent.
As one who loves their parents unconditionally, through their faults. As an aging parent, but one who you can still see as the titan they were when you were a child. You wish you could see them in all that glory again.
Liberals love America a different way, and in my opinion, a more brutally honest way. Liberals love America as one loves a child. Something to be nurtured, grown, developed. Something that is not perfect, and needs a lot of work to be improved upon. And they are willing to do that work.
When you see liberals out in droves carrying signs, shouting and chanting, you look at them derisively and ask, “Why do they hate America?”

That isn’t hate, my man. It is the greatest expression they can make of how much they love this country. In my opinion, it’s a much stronger expression of love for country to get out and act to work on righting wrongs, improving conditions, standing up against injustice than to blindly wish things were like they were back in the ‘50s before the dirty hippies messed everything up. (I hope that’s as far back as you want to go.)
Maybe you should start to show her a little more love.

333,"Trump’s Military Parade: July 4th Shouldn’t Be Turned into a Military Event, Observers Say",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trumps-military-parade-july-4th-shouldnt-be-turned-into-a-military-event-observers-say/,"Donald Trump’s plan to turn the Independence Day celebration in Washington DC into a military display is the wrong approach for a number of reasons, according to several political observers.
Unlike past recent July 4th events, Trump has turned this year’s celebration into a military parade complete with tanks, fighter jets and other vehicles.
“I think the military would prefer to have The Fourth of July be a day for the American people to enjoy themselves and their families and enjoy the fireworks and enjoy the music,” said former defense secretary Leon Panetta. “We’ve never turned the Fourth of July into a military event, and we shouldn’t do it now. I think there’s a consensus among military leaders that that’s the wrong thing to do. We are strong. We have never had to display that strength to anybody.”

MSNBC host Joy Reid ascribed a particularly dark motive to Trump’s desire for a show of hometown military might.
“Who is that message to? It’s certainly not to tyrants because he like tyrants, he loves tyrants. It’s not to [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin, it’s not to [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un, it’s not to the Saudis. Is it to our friends? Is it to Western democracies, who he doesn’t particularly like? Or is it to us?” Reid mused. “Is it to the resistance in this country? ‘I got tanks, I have this military armada.’ The message is a threat. But it’s always a threat when you roll out your military. But it’s to whom is the threat, and I suspect that the threat is to his fellow Americans. And I hate to say that, but I think that Donald Trump styles himself a tyrant, not a defeater of tyrants.”
And then there is the shady aspect to this (and, no, not the cool and comfortable sort of shady) in which Trump and the Republican National Committee (RNC) have roped off a “VIP section” which GOP bigwigs pay the Trump campaign big bucks to get into.
“… But the fact is what President Trump is trying to do here is use the men and women who are serving overseas, who are defending our country, as political props,” said Jen Psaki, who served as White House communications director for President Barack Obama. “As we know, because the RNC is selling tickets to this event. That’s not normal. When I was serving in the White House and I’m certain before I was there with past presidents, we invited men and women who were serving and their families to the White House to have a private event, we fed everyone, we gave everyone drinks and we had an event with a band and President Obama, and I’m sure President Bush and others before him, spoke to them privately. That’s appropriate. This is not.”

334,Civil Rights Groups Have Been Warning Facebook About Hate Speech In Secret Groups For Years,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/civil-rights-groups-have-been-warning-facebook-about-hate-speech-in-secret-groups-for-years/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
Facebook says its standards apply just as much in private groups as public posts, prohibiting most slurs and threats based on national origin, sex, race and immigration status.
But dozens of hateful posts in a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents raise questions about how well if at all the company is policing disturbing postings and comments made outside of public view.
Many of the posts ProPublica obtained from the 9,500-member “I’m 10-15” group (10-15 is Border Patrol code for “alien in custody”) include violent or dehumanizing speech that appears to violate Facebook’s standards. For example, a thread of comments before a visit to a troubled Border Patrol facility in Texas by Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, and Veronica Escobar, of Texas, included “fuck the hoes” and “No mames [fist].” Another post encouraged Border Patrol agents to respond to the Latina lawmakers visit by hurling a “burrito at these bitches.” And yet another mocked a video of a migrant man trying to carry a child through a rushing river in a plastic bag. A commenter joked, “At least it’s already in a trash bag” — all probable violations of the rules.
Facebook, citing an open federal investigation into the group’s activities, declined to answer questions about whether any posts in the 10-15 group violated its terms of service or had been removed, or whether the company had begun scrutinizing the group’s postings since ProPublica’s story was published. It also refused to say whether it had previously flagged posts by group members or had received complaints.
Facebook’s only response, emailed by a spokeswoman who refused to let ProPublica use her name, was: “We want everyone using Facebook to feel safe. Our Community Standards apply across Facebook, including in secret Groups. We’re cooperating with federal authorities in their investigation.”
Since April, the company has been calling community groups “the center of Facebook.” It has put new emphasis on group activity in the newsfeed and has encouraged companies, communities and news organizations to shift resources into private messaging. These forums can give members a protected space to discuss painful topics like domestic violence, or to share a passion for cookbooks. Groups can be either private, which means they can be found in search results, or secret, which means they are hidden unless you have an invitation.
This is part of an intentional “pivot toward privacy.” In a March blog post, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote, “Privacy gives people the freedom to be themselves and connect more naturally, which is why we build social networks.”
But this pivot also fosters hidden forums where people can share offensive, potentially inflammatory viewpoints. “Secret” groups such as 10-15 are completely hidden from non-members. Would-be participants need an invitation to even find the landing page, and administrators of the groups have full jurisdiction to remove a person’s access at any time.
When such groups operate out of sight, like 10-15, the public has a more limited view into how people are using, or misusing, the platform. In a secret group, only members can flag or report content that might be in violation of Facebook’s policies. The administrators of the group can set stricter policies for members’ internal conversations. They cannot, however, relax broader Facebook standards. They also can’t support terrorist organizations, hate groups, murderers, criminals, sell drugs or attack individuals.
Civil rights groups say they have been noticing and raising the issue of hateful posts in hidden forums for years — with limited response from Facebook.
Henry Fernandez, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and a member of Change the Terms, a coalition of civil rights groups pushing for better content moderation on Facebook, said the platform keeps creating features without “without vetting them for their implications for the use by hate groups or, in this case, Border Patrol agents acting in hateful ways.”
Posts in hidden groups have incited incidents of violence in the real world, most famously against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and at the 2017 white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia. The military launched an investigation of a secret Facebook group in 2017 after Marines shared naked pictures of female service members. Facebook has acknowledged the problem and has made some efforts to address it with new initiatives, such as a proposed independent review board and consultations with a group of 90 organizations, most focusing on civil rights.


ProPublica’s Border Patrol story came out the day after Facebook released an audit of civil rights issues on the platform. Recommendations included strengthening hate speech policies around national origin, enforcing a stricter ban on the promotion of white supremacy and removing an exemption that had allowed humorous posts that contained offensive content.
Facebook did not say whether it will make all of the recommended changes. But in a blog post, COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote, “We will continue listening to feedback from the civil rights community and address the important issues they’ve raised so Facebook can better protect and promote the civil rights of everyone who uses our services.”
Jessica Gonzalez, vice president of strategy and senior counsel at FreePress and co-founder of Change the Terms, said that even after the back and forth with auditors, she was not surprised that the hateful posts in 10-15 were not flagged.
“What Facebook released on Sunday is an improvement,” she said, “but I think Facebook has engaged in this all along in an appeasement strategy. They’ll do what they need to do to get the bad publicity off [their] backs.”
The civil rights audit also called for better transparency about civil rights issues on Facebook’s advertising portal, which became a priority for the company after multiple ProPublica investigations and lawsuits by civil rights groups.
Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at Tufts’ Fletcher School of Business, said the new emphasis on privacy is part of Facebook’s attempt to keep users on the platform, while reassuring investors.
“So to the extent that Facebook provides shelter to groups of all kinds — whether they are people who are sharing hateful messages or messages for the good of the world — it benefits their business model.”

335,"Despite Success, Harris Could Face Backlash for Her Biden Attack",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/despite-success-harris-could-face-backlash-for-her-biden-attack/,"Although Kamala Harris saw some initial success for her rather rough attack on former vice president Joe Biden for his civil rights record during last week’s Democratic presidential debate, the senator from California, ultimately, could pay a price, according to some political analysts.
Harris surged to third place in the crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders–and also raked in some $2.5 million in fundraising–after her surprisingly blistering rhetorical onslaught, in which she took Biden to task for his position on busing as a means to eliminate school segregation. Harris’ ambush left Biden visibly rattled.
“But there’s polling that’s coming out to support this view, in the black community it hurt her,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee and currently working as a political analyst. “This was not something that I think she’s going to walk away from with a lot of black support.”

In a separate interview, journalist A.B. Stoddard of RealClearPolitics, came to a similar conclusion, believing that ultimately Harris will come to regret her attack on Biden.
“Yes, she was very prepared to change the dynamics in this race and she was going to go — there was no question. There was no nothing. She interrupted and began launching a multi-paragraph attack with the sentence ‘You’re not a racist’ to the front-runner. He was not prepared for the ferocity of her challenge and her attack, and so he stumbled. He thought maybe this would come up, but he was ready, I guess, to be attacked ferociously by Bernie. And I think there’s a conversation going on about whether or not she is going to face a backlash to her complicated attack on Joe Biden, which was meant to show primary voters, ‘I can take on Donald Trump in a debate and I’m very tough,'” Stoddard said. “But she used that issue in a very personal way that is redounded to her benefit. She took in a gazillion contributions overnight, she’s going to get a bump in the polls, she has new endorsements.
“But the people who are with Biden, including black voters and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, are wondering if that’s the kind of thing that down the road will be looked upon as a mistake,” Stoddard added.

336,Inside the Secret Border Patrol Facebook Group Where Agents Joke About Migrant Deaths and Post Sexist Memes,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/inside-the-secret-border-patrol-facebook-group-where-agents-joke-about-migrant-deaths-and-post-sexist-memes/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
Members of a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents joked about the deaths of migrants, discussed throwing burritos at Latino members of Congress visiting a detention facility in Texas on Monday and posted a vulgar illustration depicting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with a detained migrant, according to screenshots of their postings.
In one exchange, group members responded with indifference and wisecracks to the post of a news story about a 16-year-old Guatemalan migrant who died in May while in custody at a Border Patrol station in Weslaco, Texas. One member posted a GIF of Elmo with the quote, “Oh well.” Another responded with an image and the words “If he dies, he dies.”
Created in August 2016, the Facebook group is called “I’m 10-15” and boasts roughly 9,500 members from across the country. (10-15 is Border Patrol code for “aliens in custody.”) The group described itself, in an online introduction, as a forum for “funny” and “serious” discussion about work with the patrol. “Remember you are never alone in this family,” the introduction said.
Responsible for policing the nation’s southern and northern boundaries, the Border Patrol has come under intense scrutiny as the Trump administration takes new, more aggressive measures to halt the influx of undocumented migrants across the United States-Mexico border. The patrol’s approximately 20,000 agents serve under the broader U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, which has been faulted for allegedly mistreating children and adults in its custody. The agency’s leadership has been in turmoil, with its most recent acting chief, John Sanders, resigning last week.
ProPublica received images of several recent discussions in the 10-15 Facebook group and was able to link the participants in those online conversations to apparently legitimate Facebook profiles belonging to Border Patrol agents, including a supervisor based in El Paso, Texas, and an agent in Eagle Pass, Texas. ProPublica has so far been unable to reach the group members who made the postings.
ProPublica contacted three spokespeople for CBP in regard to the Facebook group and provided the names of three agents who appear to have participated in the online chats. CBP hasn’t yet responded.
“These comments and memes are extremely troubling,” said Daniel Martinez, a sociologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who studies the border. “They’re clearly xenophobic and sexist.”
The postings, in his view, reflect what “seems to be a pervasive culture of cruelty aimed at immigrants within CBP. This isn’t just a few rogue agents or ‘bad apples.’”
The Border Patrol Facebook group is the most recent example of some law enforcement personnel behaving badly in public and private digital spaces. An investigation by Reveal uncovered hundreds of active-duty and retired law enforcement officers who moved in extremist Facebook circles, including white supremacist and anti-government groups. A team of researchers calling themselves the Plain View Project recently released a hefty database of offensive Facebook posts made by current and ex-law enforcement officers.
And in early 2018, federal investigators found a raft of disturbing and racist text messages sent by Border Patrol agents in southern Arizona after searching the phone of Matthew Bowen, an agent charged with running down a Guatemalan migrant with a Ford F-150 pickup truck. The texts, which were revealed in a court filing in federal court in Tucson, described migrants as “guats,” “wild ass shitbags,” “beaners” and “subhuman.” The messages included repeated discussions about burning the migrants up.
Several of the postings reviewed by ProPublica refer to the planned visit by members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, including Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Veronica Escobar, to a troubled Border Patrol facility outside of El Paso. Agents at the compound in Clint, Texas, have been accused of holding children in neglectful, inhumane conditions.
Members of the Border Patrol Facebook group were not enthused about the tour, noting that Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from Queens, had compared Border Patrol facilities to Nazi concentration camps. Escobar is a freshman Democrat representing El Paso.
One member encouraged Border Patrol agents to hurl a “burrito at these bitches.” Another, apparently a patrol supervisor, wrote, “Fuck the hoes.” “There should be no photo ops for these scum buckets,” posted a third member.

Perhaps the most disturbing posts target Ocasio-Cortez. One includes a photo illustration of her engaged in oral sex at an immigrant detention center. Text accompanying the image reads, “Lucky Illegal Immigrant Glory Hole Special Starring AOC.”
Another is a photo illustration of a smiling President Donald Trump forcing Ocasio-Cortez’s head toward his crotch. The agent who posted the image commented: “That’s right bitches. The masses have spoken and today democracy won.”
The posts about Escobar and Ocasio-Cortez are “vile and sexist,” said a staffer for Escobar. “Furthermore, the comments made by Border Patrol agents towards immigrants, especially those that have lost their lives, are disgusting and show a complete disregard for human life and dignity.”
The head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Joaquin Castro, reviewed the Facebook discussions and was incensed. “It confirms some of the worst criticisms of Customs and Border Protection,” said Castro, a Democrat who represents San Antonio. “These are clearly agents who are desensitized to the point of being dangerous to migrants and their co-workers.” He added that the agents who made the vulgar comments “don’t deserve to wear any uniform representing the United States of America.”
Vicki Gaubeca, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, said the postings are more evidence of the sexism and misogyny that has long plagued the Border Patrol. “That’s why they’re the worst at recruiting women,” said Gaubeca, whose group works to reform the agency. “They have the lowest percentage of female agents or officers of any federal law enforcement agency.”
In another thread, a group member posted a photo of father and his 23-month-old daughter lying face down in the Rio Grande. The pair drowned while trying to ford the river and cross into the U.S.; pictures of the two have circulated widely online in recent days, generating an outcry.
The member asked if the photo could have been faked because the bodies were so “clean.” (The picture was taken by an Associated Press photographer, and there is no indication that it was staged or manipulated.) “I HAVE NEVER SEEN FLOATERS LIKE THIS,” the person wrote, adding, “could this be another edited photo. We’ve all seen the dems and liberal parties do some pretty sick things…”

337,Trump Threatens Federal Involvement When Asked About Putin’s Comments on Western-Style Liberalism,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/trump-threatens-federal-involvement-when-asked-about-putins-comments-on-western-style-liberalism/,"Donald Trump said “maybe the federal government has to get involved” to curb liberal and progressive policies in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s public criticism of such policies.
Trump’s threat to have the federal government meddle, in some unspecified way, in the affairs of local elected officials came during his press conference following the G-20 Summit in Osaka, Japan.
Trump’s remarks came directly after Putin fired a public broadside against what the Russian leader termed liberal policies in the West.
“The liberal idea has started eating itself,” Putin said at a news conference. “Millions of people live their lives, and those who propagate those ideas are separate from them.”

Trump appeared to agree with Putin’s assessment, when asked about it during his own news conference.
“He may feel that way. He sees what is going on,” Trump said. “And if you look at what is happening in Los Angeles where it is so sad to look and what is happening in San Francisco and a couple of other ciies which are run by an extraordinary group of liberal people. I don’t know what they are thinking. But he does see things that are happening in the United States that would probably preclude him from saying how wonderful it is. At the same time, he congratulated me as every other leader of every country did for what we’ve done economically because we probably have the strongest economy we’ve ever had and that is a real positive.
“But I’m very embarrassed by what I see in some of our cities where the politicians are either afraid do something about it other they think it is votes or — Peter, I don’t know what they are thinking,” Trump added. “But when you look at Los Angeles, when you look at San Francisco, some of the other cities — and not a lot. Not a lot. But you don’t want to spread. And at a certain point I think the federal government maybe has to get involved. We can’t let that continue to happen to our cities.”
It’s not clear whether the federal meddling Trump is calling for would be even legal. Certainly, Trump’s threat of federal interference would fly in the face of the federalism which most Republicans claim to hold dear.
Editor’s Note: As alarming as Trump’s comments are, they were–in fact–based on a misreading of Putin’s remarks.
“Trump doesn’t know the difference between West Coast liberalism and Western liberalism — between supporting the Green New Deal and supporting the immortal words of the Declaration of Independence that all people are endowed ‘with certain unalienable Rights,’ including ‘Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,’” laments conservative anti-Trump columnist Max Boot told a Washington Post reporter.

338,"Trump Scored Points with DMZ Visit, But ‘His National Security Advisers Are Probably Retching’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-scored-points-with-dmz-visit-but-his-national-security-advisers-are-probably-retching/,"Although Donald Trump may have made history over the weekend by becoming the first incumbent US president to step onto North Korean soil, the elaborately staged event did nothing for the substance of Korean denuclearization.
That’s according to a variety of experts who observed the impromptu summit between Trump and North Korea strongman Kim Jong Un.
“I think it is a great historic moment, almost to the day, the 27th of July marks the 66th anniversary of the beginning of the armistice and as we indicated the first time a sitting president set foot in North Korea but when it comes to the business of negotiating here, I think that is another story,” former director of national intelligence James Clapper said, referring to the date which ended military hostilities in the Korean War.

Trump touched down on the Korean Peninsula to meet with Kim and the president of South Korea after his participation in a G-20 meeting in Osaka, Japan.
The staged event involved Trump walking up to the border, shaking hands with Kim, followed by a meeting between the two for about 40 minutes.
“What did we see here today? We saw a lot of political theater, we saw some history,” said NBC international affairs reporter Richard Engel. “I think we saw Kim Jong-Un in a totally uncomfortable environment. He was welcomed absolutely into President Trump’s space. Seemed to be a bit overwhelmed by it. This is not a leader used to being surrounded by a press scrum that is doing things improvisationally.”
The meeting of Trump and Kim at the DMZ was the third face-to-face encounter between the two men, following summits in Singapore and Hanoi.
However, like the pair’s day at the DMZ, the meetings in Singapore and Hanoi were long on stagecraft but short on actual results to curb North Korea’s nuclear program.
“So I never imagined anybody would come up with something more dramatic but you have to hand it to Trump. He knows his showbiz pretty darn well and he did that,” David Gergen, a White House counselor to presidents of both parties, said in an on-air interview. “Having said that, Ana, it’s obviously all about symbols and way over substance. The communications people in the White House may drool over this, but the national security advisers are probably retching over it. Because it promises a lot and they’re nowhere close.
“And our own CIA still believes the North Koreans don’t want to denuclearize,” Gergen added. “They don’t feel it’s in their interest. That’s at the heart at what the United States is seeking from them.”

339,Tough Debates Among Democrats Will Help Defeat Trump,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/tough-debates-among-democrats-will-help-defeat-trump/,"Sen. Kamala Harris of California scored a tremendous political moment last week when she lashed out at former vice president Joe Biden over his record on school busing for desegregation during the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami, Fla.
But one might imagine that such rough exchanges among fellow Democrats will only serve ultimately to weaken the ultimate nominee once he or she must face Donald Trump next year.
Just the opposite is true.

Because if they don’t talk about it, you bet that Trump will. And he’ll talk about things no Democrat will talk about at the debates, like Harris’ history with the late San Francisco mayor, Willie Brown. Yes, it’s 90 percent bull, but it’s effective bull. And we need to be prepared to deal with it.
There’s a huge difference between personal attacks — I don’t think people should be bringing up Willie Brown, or the Native American business in the primary debates — and issues. Bringing up Biden’s civil rights record is legitimate, as would be bringing up Harris’ record as a prosecutor.
Those things don’t invalidate the different positions they’re taking now, but people deserve an explanation for the change. A candidate who doesn’t have one will be (rightly, in my opinion) perceived as opportunistic and false.
I don’t expect people to support every position they took 20 years ago, but I expect them to have a reasonable story about their evolution away from them.

340,"Evidence Demonstrates GOP Motivated by Race, Not Immigration Numbers",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/evidence-demonstrates-gop-motivated-by-race-not-immigration-numbers/,"If the GOP is answering the “influx” of undocumented immigrants with increased border security, then they’ve got the entire issue wrong.

For the seventh consecutive year, visa overstays have been consistently outpacing illegal border crossings. Visa overstays accounted for 62 percent of new undocumented immigrants while illegal border crossers accounted for only 38 percent of those same immigrants. At the same time, illegal border crossings have been recorded at its lowest levels in the past three decades.
Sure, conservatives might care about the seriousness of illegally crossing the border, but look at the racial composition of those overstaying their visas.
Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy–largely Caucasian countries–comprise 40 percent of the top 10 countries whose citizens are responsible for visa overstays–with Canadian citizens making up over 1/7th of that population.
It makes no sense for any reasonable policy maker to ignore the massive influx of visa overstays–committed by those with a lighter skin color–to focus on a declining number of border jumpers–committed by those with a darker skin color.
Therefore, liberals default to the next reasonable explanation.
Racism.

341,Spontaneous Breakout of Spanish-speaking at Debate Turned Into Game of Gamesmanship,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/spontaneous-breakout-of-spanish-speaking-at-debate-turned-into-game-of-gamesmanship/,"Presidential hopefuls Beto O’Rourke and Cory Booker each spontaneously breaking out into riffs of Spanish speaking during this week’s Democratic debate is the result of an unusual game of political one-ups-manship between two rivals looking for any means to break out of the middle of the pack of two dozen contenders for the nomination.
Booker, an African American senator from New Jersey, has struggled to get noticed amidst the swelling ranks of Democratic competitors ever since he joined the presidential race in February.
O’Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso, Texas, enjoyed an initially powerful entrance to the campaign in March–but has been floundering for attention ever since.
So it was when both men came together on the debate stage Wednesday evening as part of the first 10-candidate cohort for what would be a two-night event to accommodate 20 of the Democratic presidential contestants: both just itching to finally break out and maybe, just maybe, join the ranks of the few fortunate front-runners.

It began when O’Rourke unexpectedly broke into Spanish mid-answer while responding to a question about tax rates.
“This economy has got to work for everyone. And right now, we know that it isn’t. It’s going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does,” O’Rourke began.
Then, in Spanish, continued: “Right now, we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes. That’s how you explain an economy that’s rigged to the corporations and the very wealthiest. A $2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality. A new democracy that is revived because we returned power to the people, no PACs, no gerrymandering, automatic and same day voter registration to bring in more voters, and a new Voting Rights Act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now. That’s how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody.”
O’Rourke is Caucasian but has spoken often the Spanish common to his native area as a means to reach out to Spanish-speaking voters and, more generally, demonstrate a comfort with potential constituents of varying cultures.
Then, after moderator Jose Diaz-Balart addressed him with a question about US border policy, Booker began in English with a curt, “Yes,” before he himself went en Espanol for the remainder of his answer.
In Spanish, Booker said, “On Day One, I will make sure that No. 1, we end the ICE policies and the Customs and Border policies that are violating the human rights. When people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border. No. 2, I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients, and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protected status can stay and remain here. And then finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place by making major investments in the Northern Triangle, not like this president is doing by ripping away the resources that we need to actually solve this problem.”

Booker’s mention of “Oscar and Valeria” was a reference to a Salvadoran migrant and his 23-month-old daughter who both drowned Sunday trying to enter the United States.
Speaking to him after the debate concluded, MSNBC political commentator Chris Matthews mentioned to Booker that those in the auditorium noticed the odd expression which appeared on his face as soon as O’Rourke broke into his Spanish riff.
“He threw down the gauntlet and I had to respond,” Booker said. “There are a number of bilingual people on that stage and it was Beto —”
“Your look on there, ‘What the heck is going on here?’ I just think it’s interesting. I guess this is going to progress now,” Matthews interjected.
“Well, you know, I was listening to him, and I was like, ‘Okay, fine. It’s good that he’s showing that. We all need to,'” Booker replied.

342,US Healthcare System Puts Profits Ahead of Patients,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/us-healthcare-system-puts-profits-ahead-of-patients/,"There are still some non-profit hospitals that really do try, physicians groups that really do try, and companies, such as Kaiser Permanente (which is a non-profit insurance company as well as a healthcare provider), that really seems to be trying to serve people with good care, and in good faith.
For the most part though, the American healthcare system is absolutely a for-profit system. Our healthcare delivery system is disjointed, and failing many. It is not uncommon for there to be three or five hospitals, multiple MRI machines, and many urgent care clinics within a couple of miles of each other. It is also not uncommon for a three county area to share one tiny hospital with no MRI, and no obstetric services. Furthermore, there is no real free market in healthcare, and there never has been. Our healthcare system is a perilous one for patients to navigate, and money is absolutely what drives much of what occurs.

When all this is added to pharmaceutical companies price gouging, thousand-dollar deductibles that make even employer-based insurance unusable for many, along with those who still have no health insurance, what we have here is an epic mess. Our embarrassingly high maternal death rate, and our lower life expectancy compared to nearly all other industrialized nations is, quite frankly, shameful. Add to this the fact that we spend more on healthcare than any other nation, and it is beyond clear that something is very badly broken. (And in case you’re curious, our healthcare system was broken long before Obamacare.)
I have spent my entire adult life providing care to ill and injured people. We have many great teaching hospitals where amazing research is done. We have many fantastic doctors and nurses. If patients do not have adequate access to our shining healthcare though, what good is any of it? If we want our country to succeed, how can we possibly do that if a large segment of our society is unable to stay healthy? How can a nation of people with inadequate healthcare continue to compete globally. If people continue needing to decide between their medicine, or feeding their family, we have failed as a society. Access to healthcare is critical not just for individuals, but for our society as a whole. It is confounding to me that this basic truism seems to be so poorly understood by so many.
The United States generally does provide excellent healthcare to those fortunate enough to afford it. Sadly though, in some areas of healthcare, the United States is woefully substandard. Take for example our dismal maternal death rates. The United States is one of the most dangerous places in the world to give birth. If simple, basic assessments and interventions, such as monitoring a woman’s rate of vaginal bleeding and a woman’s blood pressure after childbirth is not done consistently, along with quick and appropriate intervention every single time it is needed, we will keep killing new moms. Proper postpartum care, along with proper care of newborns, needs to be done correctly 100 percent of the time. As an RN, and as a mother who nearly hemorrhaged to death with her first child while no one noticed, I can say with some authority that we are failing…badly!

My primary interest as we go into the 2020 election cycle is fixing our broken healthcare system, so that every person in this country can finally have access to affordable, appropriate and safe care. To those who believe the system is fine the way it is, I flat out say that you are wrong. To those who believe that we have the best healthcare in the world, again, you are so very wrong. And to those companies who place profits over the welfare of patients, I long for the day when I can say to you good riddance, and may God have mercy upon you. You are going to need it.

343,Democratic Debate: Thoughts and Grades From Night 2,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/democratic-debate-thoughts-and-grades-from-night-2/,"Last night, I assigned grades to each Democratic candidate in the debate. I’ll repeat that here. I have not seen any analysis yet of the debate, so this is my pure, unfiltered opinion. The debate tonight was a bit of a shitshow in terms of time management and moderation, so the first set of moderators get a C from me, while Rachel Maddow and Chuck Todd get a B+.
Moving on to the candidates, in descending order:
Kirsten Gillibrand: A+
Gillibrand hasn’t been doing well so far in the polls, and I think today was a breakout moment for her. She was truly assertive, and pushed women’s health and issues as hard as they really need to be pushed. She brought up Pre-K, childcare, abortion, and more and really highlighted it. That’s important to me, and she did it without heavy pandering. She also highlighted her concrete plan on corruption, and I like how she stuck to her 2 key issues. I thought she came across as extremely well-prepared and comprehensive, focusing on the issues that matter to me. Go Kirsten!

Kamala Harris: A+
Harris also asserted herself, calling up specific actions she took in California. She confronted Biden on his past, and forced him to deal with the fact that he’s one of the less progressive candidates (which was going to happen at some point, honestly). Her record on immigration is impeccable, and she has unique experience as a prosecutor, Attorney General of California, and a senator. I thought Harris was very powerful tonight, didn’t cede ground, and didn’t jump off the left wing. I disagree with her on free college, and her gun policies, but she performed admirably. Harris stays up as a top pick.
Pete Buttigieg: A-
Buttigieg to me also held his own. He was the most reasonable moderate-type up there tonight, and he refused to be cowed by Eric Swalwell. Buttigieg has the ability to support progressive policies while also making moderates feel at home, and that’s rare. He’s also a veteran, something he alluded to while not going overboard. Buttigieg didn’t do anything outstanding tonight, which is why he’s not A or A+, but he did hold his own, and he did advocate for climate change action, for healthcare reform (while keeping a private option—- more moderate), and for, and this is a big one for me, pushing alternatives to college instead of just free college. Buttigieg remains high for me.
Joe Biden: B+
Joe Biden didn’t sink tonight, but he did appear to be playing defense. Yes, he has an outstanding record. Yes, he’s a cool dude, but tonight it felt like he was constantly defending against other candidates’ attacks and falling on his record more than being original. While I love his plan of free community college, and believe he and Obama did do a lot for healthcare and for the climate, Biden didn’t emerge as the champion of moving forward, but almost as a defender of the Obama years. I also think Harris’ call-out was fair, and he didn’t defend it well. For him to refuse to admit he was wrong all those years ago on civil rights is… not good. However, he did handle Swalwell’s “pass the torch” nonsense acceptably. I’d vote for Biden, but tonight wasn’t his best.
Bernie Sanders: B
Sanders didn’t talk as much as I’d have hoped tonight. He stuck to his guns, and kept his brand of the uncompromising socialist, and I liked that he pushed that many of the modern progressive ideas were his ideas. However, he demonized the rich, didn’t provide concrete funding for his plans, and faded into the background. I think he let the other big time candidates speak more and push more ideas, while he struggled to get to his points. I also think he was cowed by Swalwell and force to move left on guns. I disagree with that approach, and do not think a candidate like Swalwell should be influencing a prospective nominee. Biden and Buttigieg handled Swalwell far better than Bernie. I was never a Bernie fan, and unlike Warren, he didn’t convert me. Not a bad day, though.
—and our bottom 5—
John Hickenlooper: B-/C+
I think Hickenlooper would do well in the general election, and I like that he’s a scientist. Colorado also has done a lot to combat climate change, and was the first to legalize weed. However, he didn’t talk a lot, came across as forgettable, and just blended in in a way. I don’t think he’ll get much more support from this. He also demonized socialism repeatedly. While I’m no socialist, and tend to be a solid liberal rather than a leftist, I don’t think it’s productive to be going after fellow Democrats in that way.
Michael Bennet: C-
I honestly found this dude to be a discount Hickenlooper and forgettable. If someone could enlighten me on Bennet, I’d appreciate that, because I don’t remember what he said. He didn’t say anything I found offensive, so he gets a passing grade, but just barely.
Andrew Yang: D+
Argh, Andrew Yang. He has no experience, and it showed. For one, he barely talked. Second of all, his Universal Basic Income plan is his first priority, which overlooks so many issues. He also struggled to sell it, since he’d have to raise taxes to give Americans money. Yang has cool ideas, but he didn’t belong on that stage.

Marianne Williamson: F
Speaking of people who didn’t belong on that stage…. we get to Williamson. Leaving aside her failure to interrupt and speak like Gillibrand or Harris, Williamson believes some really objectionable things. Her comments on big pharma and chronic disease were indicative of a broader distrust of modern medicine, and an anti-intellectual attitude. She’s described as “lukewarm on vaccines” (10 Wild Facts About Marianne Williamson), and I guessed that as soon as I heard her talking about Big Pharma making us sick. She also believes in reparations for Black Americans, an idea so ridiculous I don’t even want to give it space here. This is not because I don’t believe in racism, institutional or personal, but because it’s logistically impossible. It shows she hasn’t at all thought the logistics of any of her plans, and is a litmus test for her inexperience. Ugh.
Eric Swalwell: F
And we get to the worst candidate of the night. Swalwell to me actively took away from the debate. He took stupid potshots at Biden for his age, Buttigieg for his inaction in a case that hasn’t been decided, and Sanders for his (very progressive) gun stance. Swalwell spent the majority of his time taking low blows at the popular Democrats, and it came across as immature and obnoxious. There are less rude ways to knock Biden for his age, Buttigieg can’t “fire the chief” during an ongoing investigation, and Bernie’s done plenty on gun control. The guy is a Milo-style provocateur, and he derails dialogue. His gun plan is also infuriatingly naive. He wants a mandatory buyback of all assault weapons. Leaving aside the varying definition of assault weapon, a mandatory buyback is exactly the ammunition the 2nd Amendment nuts need to go on about “bad gubmint takin’ muh gunz” (pun intended). You don’t get to force people to give up their property. That’s crappy. No, no, no. Swalwell’s gotta go.

344,Democratic Debate: Thoughts and Grades From Night 1,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/democratic-debate-thoughts-and-grades-from-night-1/,"We’re jumping on the bandwagon and posting thoughts of the performances in this week’s Democratic presidential debate from Miami, Fla., which was spread over Wednesday and Thursday evenings.
Being an instructor, I’ll include grades, too. These go in descending order.
We start with Part 1, or the Wednesday night matchup.
Julian Castro: A+
Castro did a fabulous job. He was able to call out specific immigration law he wanted to change, and really grilled Beto, putting him on the spot for his views on criminalizing illegal immigration. Castro also put his background as a highlight but didn’t pander. He only spoke Spanish at the end, and did it appropriately. He appeared qualified, learned, and confident. He’s one of my top picks at this point.
Elizabeth Warren: A
While I wish Warren had spoke more, what she did say, she delivered powerfully. She again was able to outline her healthcare and economic plans in a way that felt relatable, but assertive. She didn’t need to pander, and really hit home her issues. I disagree with her on guns, but she did a good job on that, too. Big disagree with Warren on quite a few issues, but she made me way more likely to vote for her. I was really shocked by how well she did.
Amy Klobuchar: A-
Klobuchar, from my perspective, did very well. She moved left a bit, but maintained her stance as the bipartisan, effective type. She has the record and credentials that a Delaney type doesn’t. I love her alternative to free college (free community college, and aid to current students). I don’t like free college because college is impractical for most people, but community college isn’t, and would let people get their feet wet and develop skills.

Jay Inslee: B+
Inslee was going to get an A- from me, but everyone apparently hates him, so I’ll drop him a letter. Inslee for me is important in the sense that he pushes climate change as the important issue it should be. No other candidate is really as passionate about climate change and I worry, once again, the disastrous future we’re careening towards will be left unsolved by candidates who don’t realize its importance. Inslee got totally cheated out of speaking time, and I feel bad for him.
Tulsi Gabbard: B+
I liked Tulsi, and she certainly advocated well for foreign policy, but she wasn’t nearly talkative enough and didn’t evoke a sense of strength in that sense. She pulled the veteran card a lot, which I didn’t like, so she was both annoying and mousy at the same time. I really liked her approach to Afghanistan (get out) and her view on Iran though.–
huge gap here…. and now our bottom 5
Bill DeBlasio: C+
I disagree a lot with DeBlasio, and his performance didn’t convince me to change those views. I thought he demonized the rich far more than he should have, as well as shilling for free stuff. Maybe this is just my political opinion, but he didn’t change my views, so he goes here. I found him very forgettable.
John Delaney: C
Everyone rips on this guy, and I’m no exception (I mean, come on, he’s barely passing), but I don’t think he was the worst. I think his ideas of bipartisanship are admirable, but he doesn’t have the cred to back it up. He seemed like an all around nice guy with nice ideas, but got totally walked over by the other candidates. He’s way too milktoast for this election, way too moderate, and he got put in his place. Nothing interesting, solid C.
Beto O’Rourke: D
Ah, Beto. I’m disappointed in you. I had high hopes for Beto, but he dodged every question. It was pro dodgeball with this guy. Castro also smoked him on immigration, his signature issue. Also, I speak Spanish. I understood Beto’s Spanish, and it wasn’t anything complex or insightful. He didn’t add to the conversation with it. It was straight pandering. Castro handled the Spanish issue correctly on all fronts, Beto did not. He came across as a wishy washy demagogue and I’m disappointed in him.

Cory Booker: D
I’m seriously irked that everyone thinks Booker did a good job. To me, he was one of the worst, if not the worst, and one of the most disappointing. He played identity politics like he was in the Olympics. Every single comment was “In my poor black neighborhood this” and “I live in the inner city” that. It really bothered me that every thought was connected to some pander point of his. Which brings me to the worst of all… his Spanish. Again, I speak Spanish. I can tell you that his content was simplistic, and his pronunciation was atrocious. “Inakkkkceptahbleh” anyone? Cory isn’t Hispanic. He’s done nothing specifically for Latino people. He should not be up there pretending to speak Spanish with the likes of Beto (a proficient speaker) and Castro (a native speaker). If you want to speak Spanish as President, great, I support you 100 percent. However, don’t try to present yourself as Mr. Spanish when you clearly aren’t. Will not be voting Booker.
Tim Ryan: F
Yeah… everyone’s got this guy already. Looked awkward as hell, nobody’s heard of him, mixed up Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and all around was just annoying. I get he was trying to be the Midwestern moderate, but that seat’s taken, buddy. He should drop out tomorrow.

345,Mueller’s Answers to Two Questions Could Put Trump’s Presidency in Real Jeopardy,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/muellers-answers-to-two-questions-could-put-trumps-presidency-in-real-jeopardy/,"Since he spent months now insisting that Robert Mueller’s report fully exonerated him of both collusion with the Russians and obstruction, one might imagine President Donald Trump would absolutely welcome Mueller’s congressional testimony next month just to emphasize the point.
Nothing could be further from the truth, with Trump once again slamming Mueller–and even accusing, with no evidence, the former special counsel of committing a crime.
Why is Trump so agitated?

Because he knows there’s a risk of two pertinent questions coming from Congress that Mueller is likely going to have to answer:
Although you did not find sufficient evidence to level charges of conspiracy against the president, are you satisfied that there were indeed acts of collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign?
In your report, you observed that, if you had confidence that the president had not commited a crime, you would have so stated. You did not so state. Do you therefore believe that there is a sufficient level of evidence to charge the president with a crime? Did you refrain from this solely on the basis of Justice Department policy?
If Mueller answers “Yes” to either of those questions, Trump’s presidency will be in significant jeopardy. Trump is well aware of this, so he’s railing against Mueller (once again) in an effort to discredit him ahead of time.
Unfortunately for Trump, Robert Mueller is far more credible then the current president has ever been. If he steps up and says that the president of the United States knowingly engaged in acts that would, for any other citizen, warrant indictment…that’s the ball game.

346,"Debate Thumbs Down: Ocasio-Cortez Mocks Democratic Candidates for Being Ill-Prepared, Speaking ‘Spanglish’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/debate-thumbs-down-ocasio-cortez-mocks-democratic-candidates-for-being-ill-prepared-speaking-spanglish/,"At least one Democrat was decidedly unimpressed with the performance of the 2020 primary candidates in their first televised debate.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert shortly after the debate wrapped, mocked her Democratic colleagues for being ill-prepared and speaking amateur Spanish. 
“I represent The Bronx, there was a lot of Spanglish in the building,” Ocasio-Cortez told Colbert. “I thought it was humorous sometimes, at times.”
The freshman Democrat then showed off her own Spanish speaking ability, saying in Spanish, “Hello, I’m running for president, I will not give you an answer to your question.”

But that wasn’t the only thing Ocasio-Cortez mocked Democrats for. She also said the candidates came off as unprepared, like students who’ve crammed for an exam.
“I think sometimes with the debate stage this big, it can kind of seem like a high school classroom, and so there are some folks that, like, didn’t seem like they read the book, and then they got called on,” she said. 
Asked if she’s referring to anyone in particular, Ocasio-Cortez replied: “It depends on the question. So— so they’ll answer the question or they’ll get called on, and I don’t think some candidates thought that they were going to get called on, on a certain question. And they’ll be like, “Yes, the hero was courageous and the protagonist of the story.”
She also attacked debate host network NBC for not asking more questions about global climate change.

“I don’t think that we are discussing climate change the way we need to be discussing climate change,” she said of the debate. “In our country. It is such a huge, broad, systemic issue, and you can’t just say, ‘Is Miami going to exist in 50 years?’ We need to say, ‘What are you going to do about this?’ And I know there’s a lot of folks, a lot of young people that have been mobilizing for an entire climate debate in the Democratic caucus. I think it’s a good idea, because when it comes to climate change — climate change is an infrastructure issue. It’s a jobs issue. It’s an energy issue. It’s a foreign policy issue. And we can’t just talk about the copacabana. You know what I mean?”
The two-night debate event wraps up Thursday evening with the second batch of 10 contenders facing off on the same stage in Miami, Fla.

347,‘It’ll Be Extraordinary’: Expectations For Mueller’s Testimony Vary Widely,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/congress/itll-be-extraordinary-expectations-for-muellers-testimony-vary-widely/,"After months of “Will he or won’t he?” House Democrats finally seem to have roped former special counsel Robert Mueller into providing testimony before Congress.
However, now the question becomes, “What will Democrats get?” And the answer may not be immediately clear-cut.
Mueller last month made a rare public appearance in which he made clear that he wanted let his report speak for itself rather than testify further about the two-year investigation he led into Donald Trump. That changed once House Democrats approved a subpoena compelling Mueller’s testimony. A former FBI director, Mueller made clear that he would not defy a lawful subpoena.
But just what will Democrats get for their trouble? Since Mueller made clear that he intends to stay within the “four corners” of his report–a redacted version of which is public–just what do Democrats stand to gain from his scheduled July 17 appearance, when he will meet with both the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees?
Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn) readily admits not expecting to learn “a whole lot new.” But relatively few Americans have actually read the 400-plus-page Mueller Report, he added. Congressional testimony will serve to refocus Americans on this issue, he said.
“I believe Bob Mueller, having watched him and known him for a long time, when he says that his testimony is his report. You should not expect, and nobody should expect that Bob Mueller is going to make any news in either of the testimonies he gives to the Congress,” said Himes, a member of the House Intelligence Committee. “Now, so you might ask, ‘Okay, what’s the point?’ The reality is that very, very few Americans have read the report. Very few Americans are familiar with the conclusions of the report, in particular Part Two of the report where Bob Mueller elaborates on 10 possible examples of obstruction of justice.

“I expect that he will be willing to discuss, using the words of the report, those examples, but of course my colleagues are going to spend a day trying to get him to say things outside of the report. I think he’s unlikely to do that,” he added.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif) readily acknowledged that he and his colleagues will ask Mueller questions beyond the contents of his report.
“Well, that is certainly what we are going to ask of him. We’re going to be asking him questions, yes, that go what’s in the report, but we’re going to be asking questions that are outside of the report,” Schiff said. “The attorney general has made it clear that he feels completely free to discuss matters not in the report, in fact the attorney general felt free to mischaracterize the report.
“And there is no law or prescription against Bob Mueller talking about other avenues of the investigation they pursued or didn’t pursue or where it led,” Schiff added. “So we’re going to have a lot of questions we’re going to ask him to answer and we’re going to expect to get answers.”
Former FBI assistant director Andrew McCabe, who counted Mueller as a colleague from their years together at the FBI, said he has high expectations for Mueller’s testimony.
“Well, Nicolle, I think it’ll be extraordinary,” McCabe said in an on-air interview with MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace. “I think you only have to look back as far as the very limited 9-minute statement that Director Mueller gave just a few weeks ago, completely changed the conversation around the report, around the investigative findings and the impact that that report has had on people in Congress and I think on the general public.

“So if you extrapolate out from that very brief statement to think about Director Mueller sitting behind the witness stand answering questions from both sides, I do agree … that he’ll likely stay within the four corners of his report, but there is incredible ground to cover there and I think the revelations that many, many people have not heard before, have not read in the report, so I think you can’t underestimate the significance of the director’s upcoming testimony.”
One group not pleased by Mueller’s impending testimony is congressional Republicans, if Rep. Mark Meadows’ reaction is any indication.
The North Carolina Republican threatened fireworks for the day of Mueller’s testimony.
“Listen, it is not a good day for America but Bob Mueller better be prepared,” he said in an appearance on Fox News.

348,Just One Reason Why You Don’t Want an Isolationist United States,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/just-one-reason-why-you-dont-want-an-isolationist-united-states/,"What is the main function the United States Navy currently performs?
If you say “strategic deterrence to prevent Russian or Chinese aggression” or “supporting the US military in the Middle East” or something like that, you’re not completely wrong, but those functions aren’t the whole of the day in, day out bread and butter of US naval action.
One of the US Navy’s most important functions, on a day to day basis, is piracy suppression.

As an American, you can buy smartphones made in China and electronics from Taiwan and cars from Japan because the US Navy prevents piracy and allows easy, cheap, and safe trade of goods.
The US Navy is the most effective piracy suppression force on the planet. It occupies a considerable amount of naval time and resources. And because it’s the US Navy, those resources can be spent in places that most protect US commercial interests.
An isolationist United States would leave piracy suppression to others. At best, that would mean those other nations would prioritize their own commercial interests, not US commercial interests; at worst, it wouldn’t happen at all.
An isolationist United States is a really dumb idea. It would harm US commercial interests and therefore the US economy. And that’s only one of many reasons it’s a dumb idea.

349,Advice to Dem Nominees: Do Not Talk About Trump at the Debate,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/democrats/advice-to-dem-nominees-do-not-talk-about-trump-at-the-debate/,"When the crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders meet for the first time in debate beginning Wednesday evening, they should avoid one big topic: that of the man they hope to replace, Donald Trump.
That’s advice from a notable Democratic pollster and strategist.
Some 20 of the 25 Democratic contenders for the 2020 presidential nomination will gather in Miami, Fla., for the first in a series of debates split over Wednesday and Thursday evenings in which 10 hopefuls will face off each night.

“If I were being paid to consult, I would say, don’t talk about Trump. I mean, you take a shot at Trump, but most of this, they’re at 2-, 3-percent support, you have to talk about yourself, you guys, you got to make the case, you have to have a moment here that breaks through, that’s about you, because most of the Democratic primary universe, they have very little idea of you unless your name is Joe Biden or Sen. [Bernie] Sanders,” said Cornell Belcher, pollster and founder/president of Brilliant Corners Research & Strategies. “If you’re one of those candidates sitting at 2- or 3-percent support, I would not waste a moment of my time talking about Donald Trump, but talk about me and why I should be the president.”
In the crowded field of more than two dozen hopefuls, aside from the top three or four front-runners, most candidates are polling at about 3 percent or less in public support.
The debates are held under the auspices of the Democratic National Committee, which narrowed the 25 hopefuls to the allotted 20 debate slots based on criteria of meeting set thresholds in public opinion polling and/or fundraising support.
The debates will be broadcast Wednesday and Thursday evenings on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo.

350,‘How Dare You Torture Children To Try To Get a Compromise out of Dems’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/immigration/how-dare-you-torture-children-to-try-to-get-a-compromise-out-of-dems/,"Donald Trump and his administration are coming to condemnation for the squalid conditions in which the government has been holding the children of detained immigrants.
Children, upwards of 2,000 at any given time, reportedly are being held without basic supplies and conditions, such no bathing, no soap or toothbrushes–and in the case of the very young–without diapers.

The children are being held as part of Trump’s Draconian policies to cut immigration across the southern border.
“Perhaps it’s not surprising this keeps happening, when the people running our nation’s [immigration] constantly denigrate, insult and dehumanize migrants,” said MSNBC host Chris Hayes.
Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) also attributed the conditions to a lack of compassion.
“This is a huge level of incompetence and lack of compassion. The standards for sanitation, food, medicine for water, for cleanliness have been violated repeatedly and seems like intentionally,” Merkley said. “I think any American would be horrified to see these conditions. These are things that are fairly easily remedied with bottles of water and soap and access to a bathroom, with taking small children who have a medical condition and getting them to medical care. I don’t think we can simply say that it’s the level of the influx.
“I just think that we need to have a thorough investigation of what has happened and hold people accountable for failures, whether intentional and deliberate. This is absolutely unacceptable,” Merkley added.
What’s worse is that the creation of such unacceptable conditions was intentional by the Trump administration to pressure Democrats to accept more of Trump’s anti-immigration agenda, according to Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif).
“You know, this is a human rights abuse. This is such a stain on our country. I have spent the last 20 plus years working to transform our nation’s child welfare system. And this is a situation, like my tweet said, if any parent did anything that is going on on the border, the children would literally be taken away and put in foster care. You can’t tell me that this problem cannot be solved,” Bass said. “You remember that President Trump just a few days ago said, well, he was going to cancel education, cancel recreation, cancel the hygiene needs. This was deliberate. How dare you torture children to try to get a compromise out of Democrats?

“And I am sorry, but hearing about children walking around in soiled diapers, hearing about children taking care of toddlers, you are talking about straight up child abuse, and I think that this needs to be condemned internationally, frankly,” she added.
Most of the immigrants being taken into custody aren’t criminals, just people seeking a better life, said CNN host Don Lemon.
“When I saw it I said, ‘This can’t be real. This is not real.’ And the alert came up. It’s real. … I have been asking people, ‘All, who are we? Who are we as people to sit and judge people who are trying to come across for a better life and conditions?’ And to cast most of them or all of them in light they’re trying to get something free. Or breaking the law. …
“For the most part, people are coming over and risking their lives because they want to have a better life. What America offers. What America offered you,” Lemon added. “And what it offered at least in the recent past to people like me. And so I don’t understand who we are. I don’t know. I don’t know how anybody can twist this into, ‘They shouldn’t be bringing kids anyway.’
“If you’re saying that to yourself, what a terrible sentiment to have. Get on your knees tonight. And ask for guidance on how to feel about this issue,” Lemon added. “And ask God to soften your heart. Or at least speak to you about who you have become as a human being.”

351,Getting to the Truth Behind Trump’s Aborted Iran Attack,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/__trashed-2/,"I’m sorry, but as much as I’d like to give him the benefit of the doubt as he describes the reasons he suddenly called off his planned attack on Iran last week, Donald Trump has lost pretty much any and all credibility he might have had when he first took office. He’s been recorded in over 10,000 lies since that time, not to mention that, with respects to Iran, he’s utterly compromised the entire United States’ credibility — after all, they can’t trust anything one president says if another can simply override it.
As far as this particular incident goes, a fourth-grader would be able to tell you that any move towards military action is likely to cost lives on the ground. Trump knew that from the outset when asking the Joint Chiefs for retaliatory options — there’s no way he couldn’t. The idea that he changed his mind because the Pentagon tossed him an estimated body count just doesn’t seem likely to my mind: and bear in mind, this is the very same president that has frequently threatened Iran with total obliteration in the event of a conflict between them.

Such obliteration would cost millions of lives (Iran has a population of 81 million people), and even though it’s arguably an idle threat, you don’t make a threat like that if you don’t intend to act on it.
Put bluntly: Trump doesn’t give a damn about Iranian lives.
As for why he actually cancelled the attack…I expect it’s because he realised that it wouldn’t play well for his re-election chances. Even his own supporters have made it clear that they don’t want another war, and the shooting of the drone didn’t generate the level of public outrage that would help Trump to justify his actions. To the rest of the world, a lethal attack on the Iranian population would be considered a staggering overreaction, considering the Iranians only blew up an unmanned flying camera, and ignored the manned aircraft that they could have shot down.
Do also note that Russian leader Vladimir Putin discouraged military action, and informed Trump that Iran remained in compliance with the JCPOA (ironically, since the US backed out of that deal negotiated during the Obama administration to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon).

Add finally that Trump had already initiated additional economic sanctions in response to the attack. Further cripple their economy and then attack their citizenry — all for a drone. There’s no way that would be considered justifiable by anyone.
To say that he did it because of the cost in lives, though — does that sound like the blustering president we’ve all come to know, distrust and feel disgusted by?

352,Elizabeth Warren Seeks to Root Alleged Racist From Federal Service,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/elizabeth-warren-seeks-to-root-alleged-racist-from-federal-service/,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent separate letters to Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Inspector General Mark Bialek expressing concern that Eric Blankenstein, who has a history of racist writings, has been hired at HUD in a position with authority over the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), according to Warren’s Senate office.
FHA facilitates more than half of the purchase money mortgage loans to Black and Latino borrowers.
In 2018, while Blankenstein was serving as the policy associate director in charge of the division at the CFPB that is responsible for enforcing the country’s fair lending laws, reports revealed that Blankenstein had previously written a blog expressing overtly racist views.
Specifically, among other troubling statements, Blankenstein used a series of racial slurs, described efforts by the University of Virginia to impose harsher penalties for acts of racial intolerance as “racial idiocy” and described the majority of hate-crimes as “hoaxes.”
Warren–who not only is one of 25 Democrats running for president but prior to joining the Senate helped first established the CFPB–called for Blankenstein to be fired at the CFPB given these troubling statements, and last month, Blankenstein resigned and left the CFPB.

At the time, Inspector General Bialek opened an investigation into Blankenstein’s racist writings, and Warren requests an update on the status of that investigation in her Monday letter:
“I am eager to see the results of your report, given the impact that a person in Mr. Blankenstein’s position could have on the availability of mortgage credit to communities of color,” Warren wrote in her letter to Bialek.
The gap between the white and black homeownership rate is larger today than it was when housing discrimination was legal and the FHA can and should play a role in reversing that trend, Warren said. The FHA plays an outsized role in facilitating homeownership in communities of color. Changes in policy or legal interpretation, however similar to those Blankenstein made at the CFPB, could rip away mortgage credit from these already underserved communities, Warren added in a statement outlining the situation.
Just as Blankenstein’s racist views disqualified him from overseeing the enforcement of lending discrimination law at the CFPB, his views also disqualify him from working at HUD — an agency with a mission that includes, “build(ing) inclusive and sustainable communities free from discrimination.”
HUD is supposed to achieve this goal in a number of ways, including by enforcing the Fair Housing Act, by distributing government housing and infrastructure funds, and by promoting sustainable homeownership — especially for first-time underserved homebuyers. His troubling views suggest that he will be unable to fulfill core parts of HUD’s mission, including fighting housing discrimination and closing the homeownership gap between white borrowers and borrowers of color, Warren asserted.
“Our country is currently in the midst of a housing crisis that disproportionately affects people of color. It is imperative that HUD recognizes the importance of addressing this crisis not just in the policies it pursues but also in the people it hires,” wrote Senator Warren in her letter to Secretary Carson. “Mr. Blankenstein’s racist writings disqualify him from working at HUD(,) and I ask that you reconsider your decision to offer him a position in your department.”

The senator has requested responses to her letter and questions to address her concerns by July 5, 2019.

353,Sanders’ Support for the 1994 Crime Bill Was Greater than He Would Like You To Believe,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/crime/sanders-support-for-the-1994-crime-bill-was-greater-than-he-would-like-you-to-believe/,"While Joe Biden has steadily taken criticism for the massive 1994 anti-crime law, one of Biden’s top rivals for the 2020 presidential nomination has been carefully concealing the full extent of his support for the measure, according to an MSNBC reporter.
Sen. Bernie Sanders’ backing for the crime bill now appears more fulsome than he has let on in recent years as the Vermont independent has mounted two progressively powered runs for the presidency.
Although largely popular at the time, the more punitive aspects of the 1994 legislation have always been controversial. That controversy only has grown in recent years–particularly among politically progressive Americans–as impacts of the law have disproportionately affected African American communities.
Biden certainly can’t hide from his role in the crime bill, given that at the time he was a chief architect as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Sanders, however, was the largely anonymous sole congressman from the small, rural state of Vermont in just his second two-year term.
Today, as he challenges presidential front-runner Biden for the Democratic nomination from the progressive left, Sanders limits his public statements on the crime bill is that he really only supported it because it had the assault weapons ban and the Violence Against Women’s act attached to it, according to MSNBC reporter Heidi Przybyla.

“However, I did go back to 1994 and look into the congressional record, and this is really just reflective of the party at the time [and] I’m not saying Bernie Sanders was any different than many Democrats, including those in the CBC,” Przybyla said, referring to the Congressional Black Caucus by its acronym.
The CBC had public misgivings about how the law would effect African Americans, even at the time the legislation was up for debate. CBC members fought for changes in the bill and many ultimately voted for passage.
“However, he did say in August of 1994, ‘On balance, its positive initiatives to control crime outweigh the negatives,’ that he supported many of these things,” Przybyla said of a younger Rep. Bernie Sanders.
“I saw coverage back in Burlington of him supporting the hiring, for instance, of more cops, voting for at least once an amendment to increase prison funding,” Przybyla added. “He, like many Democrats of the time, saw this as a good compromise at the time when the nation was facing a big crime epidemic, the crack cocaine epidemic. And Bernie fought for things in here to make this a better bill.”

354,"New Legislation Would Enable College for All, Eliminate $1.6 Trillion in Student Debt",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/new-legislation-would-enable-college-for-all-eliminate-1-6-trillion-in-student-debt/,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well as Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) unveiled landmark legislation Monday to eliminate tuition and fees at all public US four-year colleges and universities, as well as make community colleges, trade schools, and apprenticeship programs tuition- and fee-free for all. The three lawmakers’ proposal also would eliminate all $1.6 trillion in student debt for 45 million Americans. 
“This is truly a revolutionary proposal which accomplishes three major goals,” said Sanders, one of the leading candidates among 25 seeking the Democratic nomination for president. “First, in a highly competitive global economy, it makes certain that all Americans, regardless of income, can get the college education or job training they need to secure decent paying jobs by making public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free and debt-free.
“Second, in a generation hard hit by the Wall Street crash of 2008,” Sanders said, “it cancels all student debt and ends the absurdity of sentencing an entire generation to a lifetime of debt for the ‘crime’ of getting a college education. Third, it pays for these proposals by implementing a tax on Wall Street speculators. In 2008, the American people bailed out Wall Street. Now, it is Wall Street’s turn to help the middle class and working class of this country.”

Under the College for All Act, the average student loan borrower would save about $3,000 a year, and the economy would get a boost of approximately $1 trillion over 10 years, which could be used to buy new homes, cars, and open up small businesses, the legislation’s sponsors said. Student debt is also disproportionately impacting African Americans and Latinos, according to the three legislators. Twelve years after starting college, for example, the median black borrower owed more than he or she had taken out in the first place, they said.
The estimated $2.2 trillion cost of this bill would be paid for entirely by a tax on Wall Street speculation. During the financial crisis, Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the United States. Now, argue the lawmakers, it’s Wall Street’s turn to help rebuild the disappearing middle class. The members of Congress backing the legislation propose imposing a small Wall Street speculation tax of just 0.5 percent on stock trades (50 cents for every $100 worth of stock), a 0.1 percent fee on bonds, and a 0.005 percent fee on derivatives, which would raise up to $2.4 trillion over the next decade. More than 1,000 economists have endorsed a tax on Wall Street speculation and some 40 countries have already imposed a similar financial transactions tax, the lawmakers said.
This milestone legislation was endorsed by the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association, Freedom to Prosper, Social Security Works, Progress America, Progressive Democrats of America, Student Action, People’s Action, Debt Collective, the American Medical Students Association, CREDO Action, and the Council for Opportunity in Education (COE).

355,"Back In South Bend, Buttigieg Met By: ‘Stop Telling People to Shut Up!’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/back-in-south-bend-buttigieg-met-by-stop-telling-people-to-shut-up/,"Out on the presidential campaign trail, “Mayor Pete” has been lifted in public opinion polls and been the subject of flattering media coverage, with the smarts and charisma to potentially be the nation’s first openly gay president.
But last week, stepping off the trail to return to South Bend, Ind., in the wake of a deadly police shooting which left an African American resident of the city dead, Pete Buttigieg got a decidedly messier reception.
Buttigieg returned to the city he has led for nearly eight years after a white police officer shot and killed an African American male but did not record the incident on his police body-camera.
Although Buttigieg held a town hall-style meeting with South Bend residents to address the matter, the young mayor received quite a bit of angry blowback, exposing a tangible rift between the presidential candidate and his own African American community.

“How are we supposed to trust this? Mayor, when that young man got killed, run over at the stop light, what did you say? What did you say, mayor? You dang near blamed him,” one black resident told Buttigieg. “How are we supposed to trust you? And you done partnered with a lot of the stuff we done did with my organization. I understand that. But when you mess up, we have to call that out, too. When the city mess up, we have to call that out, too. And our people is hurt. Dr. King said, everybody out here want to be Martin Luther King scholars.
“I’m not encouraging a riot, but these people [are] unheard. That’s why you’re getting the reaction you’re getting,” that resident added. “Stop telling people, ‘Shut up.’ Stop telling people how to feel because you’re not feeling the same way we feeling. I’ve been fighting the same fight with these people six years.”
Some residents became incensed when Buttigieg’s staff told them to be mindful of the mayor’s time. The following day, Buttigieg flew to rejoin the presidential race with scheduled remarks at the South Carolina Democrats’ convention.
That next day, in the early-decision state of South Carolina, Buttigieg chose to address the controversy roiling back home.
“We’re living through this right now in South Bend where our whole community is grieving in the wake of a police shooting that claimed the life of a black man in our city,” he told Palmetto State Democrats. “And while the facts are still coming in on what happened, one of the reasons why we’re all in so much pain is not just the anguish of a family, but it’s the anguish of a community that knows what is at stake in police, that knows the burden that lies over every community due to the fact that through our history, many of the worst moments in racial injustice in this country were served up at the hands of law enforcement.”

356,"Trump Will Get ‘Much, Much Worse’ To Energize His Exhausted Supporters",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/trump/trump-will-get-much-much-worse-to-energize-his-exhausted-supporters/,"Since he’s facing a stream of polls showing him losing his bid for re-election, expect Donald Trump to get more “frantic” and do more to get his voter base wound up to incentivize them to turn out to vote next year.
That’s what a Pulitzer Prize-winning political commentator recently discussed during an on-air discussion on MSNBC’s morning program, Morning Joe.
Polls have been mostly a steady drumbeat of alarming news for Trump and his team, as he is no longer popular in the most important battleground states, and appears to be failing in hypothetical match-ups against various Democratic opponents.
Trump last week officially kicked off his re-election campaign with a rally in Orlando, Fla.

“I think we, if anything, underestimate how desperate he’s getting already at the signs that there’s just Trump exhaustion out there, that the base is going to take a whole lot more stoking, even more stoking than he did last time, a lot more stoking to get them out in comparable numbers,” said Eugene Robinson, columnist for The Washington Post.
“I saw some figures a few weeks ago on responses to his tweets. And that’s way down,” Robinson added. “People become desensitized over time and I think some people have become desensitized, others have just wandered away, others have been appalled by various things he’s done.
“You know, he looks really frantic right now, but I think we haven’t seen anything yet. I think it’s going to get much, much, much worse before it gets any better,” he concluded.

357,"Warren Wins Straw Poll, Surges in New Hampshire",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/democrats/warren-wins-straw-poll-surges-in-new-hampshire/,"Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren took first place in an unofficial straw poll while also surging statewide in New Hampshire.
Warren took the top prize in the straw poll held at NH Progressive Summit, organized by Granite State Progress.
Warren grabbed 34.6 percent of the vote, according to Zandra Rick Hawkins, executive director of Granite State Progress. Bernie Sanders came in second at 24 percent, with Cory Booker of New Jersey and Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii each grabbing six percent. Some 250 people took part in the summit, which took place last Saturday at Manchester Community College. 
Any “home field advantage” between leaders Warren and Sanders likely cancelled each other out, as both serve as US senators for states adjacent to New Hampshire: Warren for Massachusetts and Sanders for Vermont.

Meanwhile, a broader public opinion poll indicates Warren making real strides across first-in-the-nation-primary state New Hampshire.
Former vice president Joe Biden remains the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, with Sanders a solid second. But the CBS News/YouGov online survey also reveals what other polls the past six weeks have shown — an ongoing rise for Warren. 
Biden stands at 33 percent support in the survey, far ahead of the rest of the historically large field of nearly two dozen candidates. Sanders, who trounced opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic New Hampshire primary, is second at 20 percent.
Warren stands in third, at 17 percent, with South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10 percent, and Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 7 percent. 
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas is at 4 percent, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 3 percent. Everyone else registered at 1 percent or less.
Finally, Warren opened four field offices this week in New Hampshire, including one in Portsmouth.

358,Where Supreme Court’s Flowers Racial Bias Decision Fits Within Spectrum of Rulings,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/law/where-supreme-courts-flowers-racial-bias-decision-fits-within-spectrum-of-rulings/,"I’m fairly confident that the Supreme Court got it right in the Curtis Flowers case, in which the high court on Friday tossed out Flowers’ murder conviction.
The court threw out the conviction of Curtis, an African American from Mississippi, because of a prosecutor’s efforts to keep African Americans off the jury. The defendant already has been tried six times and now could face a seventh trial.
It should be noted that, even in today’s hyperpartisan environment, the vast majority of cases that the Supreme Court accepts are decided unanimously: 9–0. All the justices agree on the decision, usually without even separate “concurring opinions.” Sometimes without even writing an opinion, just, “Sorry, the lower court decision stands” or “Go back and rehear this case in light of …” (… being either a particular clause of the Constitution, or a previous decision of the Supreme Court).
The fact that this case was decided 7–2 is a strong indicator. The more justices agree, the more likely it is they are right.

As for bringing liberal and conservative justices together, I doubt it will have that effect. As I said, the vast majority of cases have no dissent. When the law and the facts are clear, the “liberal” vs. “conservative” distinction plays little or no role. And in fact that distinction really only matters on a few issues: abortion, First Amendment (free exercise vs. establishment), and voting rights.
On many other issues, like free speech, due process, property rights (5th Amendment “takings” clause”) the justices are divided, but not along the “liberal/conservative” axis.

359,"Trump, Lies And Golf Scores",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-lies-and-golf-scores/,"Trump’s golf habits are a fascinating look at his character.
If you examine Trump’s history, what people close to him or who work with him tell you, you can conclude one important thing, and it’s related to golf.
Trump loves golf for one reason. It gives him the opportunity to deceive. That’s what he loves. That’s his version of a perfect swing. A hobby.
Here’s the funniest thing about it.
HE SUCKS AT IT.
Trump is the worst liar since George Dillman. Martial Art Pretenders: A History of Imitators and Snake Oil
And by worst I don’t mean “the one who does the most of it,” I mean “The one who does it most poorly.”
And this is classic Trump. He thinks he’s good at 100 things he’s freaking terrible at.

But let’s focus on lying. Because it’s really his signature thing. He thinks he’s really good at it. And Holy Dogshit, does he suck at it!
So what makes a good liar?
If you look at The 18 Traits of Good Liars, and you start to read you start to think…maybe…maybe…
But then you hit No. 4. Then No. 9. Then No. 10, and once you hit that one (well preparedness) suddenly you see the problem.
Now the one thing the article touches on that it doesn’t get deep enough into is consistency. A good liar is consistent, because they can be. The best way to out a liar is inconsistencies. And it’s the one thing you can clearly point to with Trump.
You know he talks out of his ass because there are so many recorded cases of him talking out his ass on one side then talking out the exact opposite side of his ass on the other. Here are 10 examples:
10 times that Trump has contradicted himself in his first year in office
But the thing is…like so many other things he’s…just… terrible at, he appears to A.) think he’s great at it, and B.) love doing it.
What a weird guy.

360,CNN Anchor Lemon Defends Biden’s Segregation Comments: It Was Just ‘Inartfully Said’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/cnn-anchor-lemon-defends-bidens-segregation-comments-it-was-just-inartfully-said/,"Don Lemon, a prominent African American CNN anchor who hosts a prime-time program for the news network, has waded into this week’s tumult over Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden’s working relationship with segregationist senators.
Biden, consistently the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, ran into hot water this week when he discussed working with those you might not agree with. He used the example, from decades ago, working as a young senator with the racist Democratic senator from Mississippi, James Eastland.
Affecting a southern drawl in telling the story, Biden said Eastland “never called me ‘boy,’ he called me ‘son.'”
“Boy” was commonly used as a racial epithet to denigrate African American males.
In the midst of the controversy, Lemon on-air said he said Biden ought to be given the benefit of the doubt.

“I understood what, well, former vice president Joe Biden was trying to say. I understand it. He did it inartfully, and many times in conversations we do,” Lemon said.
Lemon added that he made the same sort of mistake just a few evenings earlier byo comparing Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler.
“I didn’t mean to compare Hitler to the president, but it was inartful. I was trying to speak about people who give misinformation and propaganda. And you tried to help me out,” Lemon said in an on-air discussion with colleague Chris Cuomo. “You’re like, ‘That’s an extreme. That was inartful.’ I didn’t mean in it that way and I think we have to — sometimes people say things in a conversation and you get what I’m trying to say, but people turn it into something else.
“And I get what Joe Biden was trying to say in the same vein. And what he did was inartful by saying ‘Boy,’ right? So if he didn’t say ‘Boy,’ I think it would have landed differently. What he was saying was, ‘I can work with these people who were terrible. They were beyond racist, right? They were beyond what we have in the Senate and in the Congress right now, and if I can work with them then I can definitely work with the folks there.’
“So I think, you know, as we said the other night, you and I, got to give people a little bit more leeway. We should be nicer. We should be kinder and figure that out,” Lemon added. “And if you say something that was inartful and something comes out of your mouth that’s stupid that happens when you’re live. You know that happens all the time. Probably me more than you. You say, ‘That’s not what I meant.’”
Biden is one of nearly two dozen Democrats seeking the presidential nomination, for the chance to take on Donald Trump in the general election.
At least a handful of his rivals have criticized Biden for his comments, including Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, who are both African American.

361,Andrew McCabe: It Would Be Good for Congress to Make a ‘Little More Progress’ Towards Impeachment,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/andrew-mccabe-it-would-be-good-for-congress-to-make-a-little-more-progress-towards-impeachment/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is getting a nudge to move more quickly toward impeachment of Donald Trump.
But, this time, it’s not a noisy member of the Democrats’ left flank. Or even one of the usual progressive advocacy groups.
No, it is a former deputy director of the FBI.
“Let’s talk about Congress. Under these circumstances, knowing what they know confronting the sort of resistance that they are getting from the administration, if they don’t act now, when would they ever? That’s the question,” said McCabe, referring to the growing number of instances in which current or former Trump administration officials are refusing to comply with lawful congressional subpoenas to either testify personally under oath, or turn over requested documents.

In an on-air CNN interview, McCabe was asked directly, “Simply yes or no, do you think they’re acting too slowly?”
McCabe replied, “I think that they should be moving forward. I think they should be moving forward in a deliberate and careful fashion. They claim to be doing that. But I think it would be good for them to make a little more progress.”
That includes such high-level officials as Attorney General William “Bill” Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn.
McCabe served as deputy director of the FBI for nearly two years, including a stint of a few months as acting director in 2017, after Trump fired Director James Comey.
McCabe, who worked his way up the FBI ranks over about 20 years, was a frequent target of Trump’s Twitter ire and ultimately was fired. McCabe has denied any wrongdoing and said his dismissal was politically motivated.

362,The ‘Safe’ Country Solution to the Immigration Crisis: It’s Really Worth Considering by All Sides,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-safe-country-solution-to-the-immigration-crisis-its-really-worth-considering-by-all-sides/,"Let’s be realistic: President Donald Trump probably doesn’t want any more immigrants in this country, especially from south of the border. And whether he has racial justifications for excluding hispanics is rather beside the point.
Out-of-control immigration is a genuine concern for a country–any country–that is having difficulty protecting its borders.  Early in his presidency Trump blamed Mexicans for the influx, yet did not acknowledge statistics that showed the numbers had cratered compared to the last decade. (A working NAFTA was a big factor, as Mexican maquiladoras–factories supplied and supported by American manufacturers, were humming, and still are).
Yet a major campaign promise was to build an impenetrable wall. Both conservatives and liberals could see the folly of it, yet Trump could not. It would deter only a few desperate Hispanics who could not find work and not the drug smugglers and rapists often cited who found entry points  across the border via tunnels, border crossings themselves, and planes–even submarines and ships! It was the ultimate folly and led nowhere. And Mexicans simply weren’t the lion’s share of the illegal entries.

The countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, just south of the Mexican border, were experiencing drug gangs, violence in general–and, as was recently reported, a collapse in their coffee industry prices. Trump probably didn’t even know where they were on a map, and many Americans do not either. (I have traveled to Mexico dozens of times and built a house in the upper Baja. And, admittedly, for a long time I thought Honduras was an island off the coast somewhere).
Our border problem really boils down to a “foot” vs. “head” problem. The “foot” is the three Central American countries a thousand miles south that are funneling immigrants northward. The “head” is the northern Mexican border adjacent to the United States where the major “head” ache lies–thousands of hispanics seeking asylum and not enough resources to cope with them.
Trump finally became aware of some of this and cut off most aid to the “foot” countries. Wrong strategy. He threatened tariffs with Mexico if that government didn’t do more to police the southern border with them. The threats worked, but were misguided. To his credit he has now come up with a solution that should work, which is to  support these countries–specifically Guatemala–in becoming  “safe” countries, with the means to keep people within their borders.
“It’s outrageous to think that Guatemala would be considered a safe third country for asylum seekers from El Salvador and Honduras, given the high number of Guatemalans who are fleeing due to unbearable levels of violence, persecution and corruption,” stated Maureen Meyer, head of the migrant rights program at the Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy group.
And would taxpayers even support sending funds that might improve Guatemala’s infrastructure and social services when there is a perception that our own infrastructure is crumbling?
Maybe, maybe not. But many are aware of the dictator Maduro’s looting of Venezuela and leaving his countrymen in poverty with little choice but to flee the country in droves. The leaders of the three hispanic countries have incentives to retain their populace–if not, at this point, the means.  (Maybe there is even oil within them.)  Their coffee growing industry could be immediately subsidized to stanch the northward migrations.
Americans need to look at a map. These countries are not landlocked hellholes, they astride the Caribbean ocean. Not far away is Cancun. English speaking Belize, quite close, is a darling of American tourism and investment. Even Costa Rica, where many older American expats reside, is nearby and a gorgeous tropical country with bordering Atlantic and Pacific shores.  The three countries are in relatively “good” company.

Investments in these countries may not necessarily pay off, but they could eventually when the countries develop as tourist meccas. U.S. government support of efforts to eradicate crime there and develop their economies would cost much less than trying to integrate their people into an America that does not want them, really–a country which has already doubled in population itself in the last 75 years to 330 million.
Mexico recently signed the USMCA agreement. That is an act of good intentions that should help the process along.  And Mexico can be a partner in the safe country proposal.

363,Frustrated Dems on Hope Hicks’ Testimony: Who Objects on Questions About Telling the Truth?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/frustrated-dems-on-hope-hicks-testimony-who-objects-on-questions-about-telling-the-truth/,"Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director and close confidant to Donald Trump, left Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee frustrated over the lack of information and cooperation she offered Wednesday, even after meeting with committee members behind closed doors.
Accompanied by White House and other attorneys, Hicks refused to answer even the most basic of questions, according to Judiciary Democrats.
Specifically, the committee wanted to question Hicks–who left the White House last year–about her knowledge about the obstruction of justice on Trump’s behalf by special counsel Robert Mueller.
“I called the hearing or the interview a farce because she had White House counsel, her own personal counsel, about six different lawyers there telling her that she could not answer anything objecting to every single thing from, you know, answering a question where she sat relative to the Oval Office, later she was asked by the chairman, ‘Did you tell the truth to Robert Mueller?’ And they immediately said, ‘Objection.’ Who objects to whether or not somebody is telling the truth to the special counsel?” a clearly exasperated Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash) asked during a TV interview. “So this was clearly the White House trying to … stymie the American people from getting information they deserve to have. We did not get a lot from Hope Hicks because of the absolute immunity claim and one thing that was interesting, John, they did not claim executive privilege. They didn’t claim executive privilege because they can’t.
“They have already waived executive privilege so what they did is claimed this absolute immunity, which is absolutely it and they kept using that but what we were able to do importantly is show the American people which will be seen as the transcript is released that the White House is blocking even a witness that would like to come and comply and let’s give Hope Hicks the benefit of the doubt,” Jayapal added. “She was there. The reality is that we weren’t able to get a lot of information because the White House locked it. Ongoing obstruction of justice.”
Attorneys went so far as to block Hicks from even divulging whether she had told the truth in previous testimony, according to Judiciary Committee member, Rep Ted Deutsch (D-Fla).

“I can give you two examples. And it will help explain the range of issues. On the subject of the obstruction of justice, laid out by Mueller, that is the president asked his personal lawyer to fire the special counsel, then when that was reported, the president asked him to lie about it, then he asked him to create a false record. Well, Hope Hicks knows about all of that, given the role that she played in the White House,” Deutsch said. “And I asked her about each of those. And we have a right to hear from her to fill in what was missing from the Mueller Report, and in each instance the White House lawyer jumped in and said, ‘No, you can’t answer that.’ Those were really troubling. But to show you how absurd it is, she couldn’t even answer a question about whether she told the truth to the Mueller team, whether she might have perjured herself to the Mueller team.”
The committee is expected to release to the public its transcript of the Hicks encounter this week.

364,"What’s a ‘Concentration Camp’? Of Definitions, Immigration, Politics and The Holocaust",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/whats-a-concentration-camp-of-definitions-immigration-politics-and-the-holocaust/,"For most Americans, the term “concentration camp” conjures names like Auschwitz, Dachau and others which dotted the European countryside during World War II: places where millions of Jews, gays and others targeted by Adolf Hitler and his Nazis were sent to their horrific exterminations.
When it comes to “concentration camps,” they were hellish places liberated by American forces and their allies. In other words, when most Americans think about the US role related to concentration camps, they think, “We were the good guys.”
So perhaps the political firestorm Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) created when she called the caged detention facilities used to hold mass numbers of detained immigrants “concentration camps” should have been expected.
For the remark, the freshman congresswoman has faced criticism from a variety of quarters–even receiving a scolding from Chuck Todd, the nonpartisan MSNBC host.
“If you want to criticize the shameful treatment of people at our southern border, fine. You will have plenty of company, but be careful comparing them to Nazi concentration camps because they’re not at all comparable, in the slightest,” Todd said, in on-air remarks. “But here’s what is as upsetting as her comments. Some Democrats have been reluctant to condemn her remarks. They don’t want to get criticized on Twitter. Fellow New York congressman Jerry Nadler tweeted in response, ‘One of the lessons from the Holocaust is ‘Never again.’ We fail to learn that lesson when we don’t call out such inhumanity right in front of us.’ Jerry Nadler surely knows that migrant detainment camps are not the same as concentration camps. So why didn’t he just say that? Why are we so sheepish calling out people we agree with politically these days?

“Obviously this isn’t a Democratic Party thing. It’s an even bigger problem on the Republican side of the aisle when it comes to President Trump and the reluctance there. Are we really so ensconced in our political bubbles, liberal versus conservative,that we cannot talk about right versus wrong anymore? Some things are bigger than partisanship. At least they used to be. And in the interim, the crux of what is truly at stake is lost. What is this country going to do about what’s happening at the border in this humanitarian crisis? We will get to that at some point, I guess, after we have this debate.
“I have no doubt Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez cares deeply about what’s happening at the border,” Todd concluded. “But she just did the people there a tremendous disservice by distracting from their plight. She said she didn’t use those words lightly. Well, neither did I.”
However, given a chance to clarify her remarks, Ocasio-Cortez made clear that–despite colloquial understanding–she wasn’t bringing up “concentration camps” in the context of the Holocaust.
“There is a very clear academic consensus on what constitutes a concentration camp, and that is the mass detention of a community of people without a trial or due process,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I think it’s pretty universally noncontroversial to say that the administration is doing exactly that and meets the academic requirement for what a concentration camp is.”
Asked specifically if she was comparing current US immigration detention to what happened in World War II, Ocasio-Cortez replied, “No, no.”
As a matter of definition, Ocasio-Cortez is not alone. Wikipedia, the worldwide and community-driven online encyclopedia and network of knowledge websites, last year added US immigration facilities to its own definition page for “concentration camps.”
And the debate opens old wounds for Japanese-Americans who, during World War II, were rounded up from their homes and sent to mass camps in the US interior. No, they were not subject to extermination, but they were held forcibly in substandard conditions. Decades later, the US government was forced to apologize for this internment.

“Part of what the toll of the Holocaust did was to reset the bar [for atrocity] so that anything short of that wasn’t even in the same universe,” Andrea Pitzer, author of One Long Night: A Global History of Concentration Camps, told The Washington Post. But, she added, “what I can tell you is, across history, every single camp system has said, ‘We are not like those other camps. Also, these people are dangerous,’ or ‘these people deserve it.’ Since the Nazi camps, since World War II, people don’t want to use ‘concentration camps’ because they don’t want to be associated with [Nazis.]”
While Ocasio-Cortez steered clear of a Holocaust analogy, others embraced the comparison.
“In 1933, there were concentration camps. In 1941, they were death camps, and that is where we are going if our consciouses are not quickly pierced,” said Angela Rye, attorney and CEO of IMPACT Strategies, a political advocacy organization based in Washington DC. “It is a problem. Do not laugh it off. Do not laugh it off.”

365,New Bill Aimed at Helping Conservatives on Social Media Called ‘Hot Garbage’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/new-bill-aimed-at-helping-conservatives-on-social-media-called-hot-garbage/,"Although some conservatives have long grumbled about how tech firms–and social media providers, particularly–treat their content unfairly, the freshman Republican senator from Missouri has finally put his legislation where his mouth is.
Sen Josh Hawley, the youngest serving US senator on Tuesday introduced his Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act, a major update to the way big tech companies are treated under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA).
Sen. Hawley’s legislation would remove the immunity big tech companies receive under Section 230 unless they submit to an “external audit that proves by clear and convincing evidence that their algorithms and content-removal practices are politically neutral.”
Affected tech firms would be policed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Hawley said legislation would not apply to small and medium-sized tech companies.
But what is truly extraordinary–aside from the obligatory and expected statements from industry, like this and this, hostile to further regulation–is just how bipartisan and across-the-board the venom is for this bill.
That’s particularly true for conservatives, save for those who feel similarly aggrieved as Hawley, who absolutely savaged this proposal.
“Man, we’ve known the Josh Hawley Section 230 force-tech-companies-to-be-politically neutral bill has been coming for a long time, we’ve known it was gonna be bad, but I don’t think I suspected it would be THIS level of hot garbage,” conservative writer Andrew Egger tweeted.

Hawley’s bill even incurred the wrath of Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy organization backed by the wealthy Koch brothers.
“Senator Hawley’s misguided legislation sets the table for stricter government control over free expression online,” said Billy Easley, a policy analyst for Americans for Prosperity. “Eroding the crucial protections that exist under Section 230 creates a scenario where government has the ability to police your speech and determine what you can or cannot say online.”
It fell to Daphne Keller, of the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law in California, to point out perhaps the most Orwellian aspects of what Hawley has proposed.
“This Hawley Bill to amend CDA 230 is wacky in a dozen little ways and in one huge way: It assumes there is such a thing as ‘political neutrality’ and that the FTC can define and enforce what that is,” Keller tweeted.
Egger, the conservative journalist who branded the Hawley bill “hot garbage,” absolutely took it apart in a piece he wrote for his employer, the website The Bulwark.

In particular, Egger explained how Hawley has Section 230–which the senator describes as a “sweetheart deal” for tech firms–all wrong.
“Here we may note in passing that Hawley’s gloss of Section 230 bears no resemblance to the actual law in question: Far from being a ‘sweetheart deal,’ Section 230 simply codifies the common-sense notion that you’re not responsible for my criminal speech just because you sold me a product that helped me say it,” Egger said. “Furthermore, nothing in the statute makes that exemption of liability contingent on ‘providing a forum free of political censorship,’ a quote Hawley and others have lifted entirely from a completely different section of the law.
“In fact, not only is it from a different part of the law, Section 230 explicitly protects providers regarding ‘any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.’ In other words, companies have the right, and are specifically encouraged, to moderate the content users post or share on their sites.”
Hawley’s announcement of the Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act makes no mention of any Senate colleagues who support the measure. Also, it is silent on any outside advocacy groups who back it.
The bill is not likely to be enacted into law anytime soon–at least in its current form.
Not only is its support in the Senate unclear, there is no way the Hawley bill would make it through the Democratic-controlled House.

366,"Ahead of Campaign Kickoff in Town, Orlando Sentinel Says ‘No Trump’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/ahead-of-campaign-kickoff-in-town-orlando-sentinel-says-no-trump/,"While his supporters were lined up outside of the Amway Center Tuesday to greet Donald Trump at his campaign kickoff rally that evening, elsewhere in Orlando, Fla., the editorial board of the Orlando Sentinel newspaper were busy preparing a very different sort of greeting.
Hours before Trump touched down aboard Air Force One, the newspaper published an extraordinary early endorsement–or more accurately, non-endorsement.
Titled “Our endorsement for president in 2020: Not Donald Trump,” the newspaper made clear that there is no chance it could support a second term for Trump.
“Some readers will wonder how we could possibly eliminate a candidate so far before an election, and before knowing the identity of his opponent,” the editorialists wrote. “Because there’s no point pretending we would ever recommend that readers vote for Trump.
“After 2½ years we’ve seen enough,” they said.
The Sentinel‘s choice is not partisan. Indeed, the paper has a long history of backing Republicans for president, endorsing Mitt Romney’s challenge as recently as 2012.

It has to do with Trump’s character and conduct in office.
“Enough of the chaos, the division, the schoolyard insults, the self-aggrandizement, the corruption, and especially the lies.
“So many lies — from white lies to whoppers — told out of ignorance, laziness, recklessness, expediency or opportunity,” the editorial explained.
The editorial board wrote that it is equally concerned with the ability of so many Americans simply to accept and swallow all of Trump’s falsehoods.
There was a time when even a single lie — a phony college degree, a bogus work history — would doom a politician’s career.
“Not so for Trump, who claimed in 2017 that he lost the popular vote because millions of people voted illegally (they didn’t). In 2018 he said North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat (it is). And in 2019 he said windmills cause cancer (they don’t),” the editorial said. “Just last week he claimed the media fabricated unfavorable results from his campaign’s internal polling (it didn’t).”
This editorial doesn’t mean the paper automatically endorses whichever Democrat will oppose Trump, the editorial explained. It could choose to sit out this election, as it did in 1980 when it refused to back either President Jimmy Carter or Republican Ronald Reagan.

“It wasn’t your typical rally,” Sentinel opinions editor Mike Lafferty told the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit journalism center. “Somehow the idea emerged that maybe we could just go ahead and put down our markers as to where we’re going to head next year. We already had come to the conclusion based on the first couple of years of the administration that we weren’t going to be able to endorse him, so we thought we might as well go ahead and say that while there was some attention focused on Orlando.”
As of late Tuesday afternoon, Lafferty said reader reaction to the Sentinel’s stance was running about “50-50.”
Trump won Florida in his Electoral College win in 2016, but recent polling puts him behind Democrat Joe Biden in the Sunshine State.

367,Howard Dean: ‘Brilliant’ Pelosi Is ‘Letting the Momentum Build’ for Impeachment,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/howard-dean-brilliant-pelosi-is-letting-the-momentum-build-for-impeachment/,"While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has long worked to tamp down a push toward impeachment of Donald Trump among her House Democrats, that is not because she’s absolutely opposed to impeachment.
Rather, she’s exercising “strategic patience,” according to Howard Dean, a former presidential hopeful and ex-chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
“But the fact of the matter is, what I think what Pelosi’s doing is brilliant, actually, she’s letting the momentum build,” Dean said in an on-air TV appearance. “I don’t think she’s resisting it at much as you said she was. That’s the story line.”

Pelosi has continued to resist impeachment even as a growing number of Democrats are pushing for it in recent weeks as current and former Trump administration officials resist lawful congressional subpoenas.
Publicly, the speaker talks about how “divisive” impeachment could be for the nation.
“I think it’s strategic patience. Look, Pelosi has not missed a step. She’s the one person who has got Donald Trump’s number in Washington,” Dean added. “She hasn’t missed a step yet. I think it’s great that people are calling for impeachment in the House. I don’t think that’s a problem. I think Pelosi’s playing her hand exactly right.”

368,CNN’s Harlow: Why Hasn’t ‘Homophobic’ Crowder Been De-Platformed?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/media-press/cnns-harlow-why-hasnt-homophobic-crowder-been-de-platformed/,"Given his recent announcement of new content restrictions for YouTube aimed at reducing what he termed “borderline” content, why hasn’t Google CEO Sundar Pichai and his team done more to crackdown on Steven Crowder, the homophobic YouTube-based commentator?
That’s what CNN’s Poppy Harlow wondered on-air, after she herself interviewed Pichai.
The controversy stems from the homophobic remarks Crowder made on YouTube about Vox journalist Carlos Maza.
“Guys, YouTube has taken a lot of heat also for these homophobic videos, specifically ones aimed at this Vox journalist, that are still on, even after they put out these new guidelines,” Harlow said. “I asked him directly, ‘Why is that still there, those videos, are you going to take them down?’ And they are in the middle of reviewing their guidelines, again, meeting with outside groups and they’re considering it, but they don’t know at this point.

“I mean, if this is fundamental to your business, they have to make the decision about where that line is between hate and free speech,” Harlow added.
In an attempt to take some action against Crowder, YouTube did remove Crowder from some online advertising.
In the end, however, that move did not satisfy Crowder’s critics while stirring up support for him among some on the right, including public backing from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex).
And after the YouTube action, Crowder reportedly saw a boost among those signing up for his feed, to more than 80,000 in one week compared to about 15,000 the week prior.
Tech giants, like Google and social media providers have come under scrutiny in Washington, including for alleged biases in what content the companies will allow. That scrutiny goes up to, and including, Donald Trump.

369,Elizabeth Warren: Her Intensity About Actually Wanting To Be President and Govern Is Breaking Through,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-her-intensity-about-actually-wanting-to-be-president-and-govern-is-breaking-through/,"From offering a uniquely specific raft of policy proposals, to simply showing an intense enthusiasm to actually do the job of the high office that she is seeking, Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren has begun to surge in the polls and actually gain some of the traction which had eluded her since she announced for president early this year.
Warren, a US senator from Massachusetts, in recent weeks has begun to experience what precious few among this year’s crowded field of presidential contenders have: actual upward mobility in a variety of public opinion polls.
In the process, Warren has attracted the attention of the man who had made a habit of mocking her on Twitter and who she ultimately wants to replace: Donald Trump.
“What Elizabeth Warren is doing is showing people she really wants this job. So she’s really expressing this hunger that people in small settings in her campaign appearances are responding to,” said RealClearPolitics editor and columnist A.B. Stoddard. “She doesn’t just want to be president, she wants to do president. I don’t know that President Trump wanted to, I think he wanted to, you know, win. But there are days when he doesn’t act like he wants to do the job. Maybe Joe Biden is not showing up enough on the campaign trail. But her intensity about wanting to actually be president and govern and make all these changes is clearly breaking through.”

Despite all of her recent success, there remains at least one barrier to winning the Democratic nomination and the chance to take on Trump: the aforementioned Biden. Because while Warren has surpassed rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont for second place in some polling, the former vice president has remained the undisputed front-runner.
“I certainly think Elizabeth Warren is surging. I think her message is getting through. It has to be of some concern to the Biden campaign,” said former Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY). “But I also know that some internal numbers, in terms of the African-American population and its polling clearly shows that Biden has a significant advantage in that field. You know, this is very fluid and certainly no one should take anything for granted. I mean, I still think it’s a bit of a jump ball.”

370,Progressive Group Targets Susan Collins Over Kavanaugh Vote,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/progressive-group-targets-susan-collins-over-kavanaugh-vote/,"A well-known national progressive organization has come out for a fundraising campaign to back the new Democratic challenger of Sen Susan Collins (R-Maine).
Democracy for America (DFA) specifically is fundraising for Maine Democrat Betsy Sweet as a means to target Collins for Collins’ crucial vote to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Sweet, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2018, announced her candidacy for US Senate late last week.
“Remember when so-called ‘moderate’ Senator Susan Collins betrayed women everywhere and cast the deciding vote to confirm Brett Kavanuagh to the Supreme Court?” asked Yvette Simpson, chief executive of DFA, which grew out of former Vermont governor Howard Dean’s 2004 bid for president.
“I’ll personally never forget how I and millions of other women felt that day: infuriated, devastated, and terrified over what this reckless, immoral decision meant for our country, our lives, and our freedom,” Simpson added.

Collins provided the crucial vote to confirm Kavanaugh, after delivering a speech from the Senate floor defending Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh faced credible allegations of sexual assault. The pro-choice Collins also assured Americans that Kavanaugh would not overturn Roe v Wade.
“Confirming a man accused of sexual assault to the highest bench in the nation is a stain on our history and on Collins’ Senate career,” Simpson wrote in an email to supporters. “When I finally moved past the emotions I felt above, one single thought stuck in my mind: we need to defeat Susan Collins in 2020.
“Today, Democrat Betsy Sweet announced her campaign to take on Collins for this Senate seat in Maine, and I’m letting you know right now that Democracy for America has her back in this critical fight, starting on Day One,” Simpson added in boldface, in her email sent several days ago.
Her vote for Kavanaugh could make Collins vulnerable when she is up for re-election next year. While Maine has been something of a “purple” state, it also lately has been trending more Democratic.
Flipping Collins’s seat will be critical if Democrats want to retake the Senate majority after the 2020 elections.
“No doubt, this will be an uphill battle. Collins is a long-time incumbent, and she’s got the power of the GOP establishment and dark money groups backing her up,” Simpson said. “But Betsy has us, and the power of more than one million grassroots members like you to help her do the unthinkable.”

371,Democrat Cunningham Jumps Into Contentious NC Senate Race With National Reach,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/democrat-cunningham-jumps-into-contentious-nc-senate-race-with-national-reach/,"A former state senator and veteran of military service in Afghanistan, who presently serves as vice chair of Gov. Roy Cooper’s crime commission, jumped Monday into the contentious–and a bit crowded–race for the US Senate seat currently held by freshman Sen. Thom Tillis (N-NC).
Although Cunningham is not the first Democrat in the race, the others have not gained traction, according to news accounts from the Tar Heel State.
Cunningham, however, jumped in with a big splash, going out nationally with a fundraising message on Day One of his campaign.

“I was born and raised in North Carolina, so I understand the challenges and opportunities our state faces every day — I’ve lived them my whole life,” he said in his fundraising email. “I was called to serve our state early in my life and was one of the youngest elected state senators in North Carolina at the age of 27.
“While in office, I fought hard for critical education priorities like smaller class sizes, teacher pay increases, and better funding for our universities and community colleges,” he added. “I was also a leading advocate for landmark clean air legislation, land preservation efforts, and campaign finance reform.”
Tillis is seen as one of the most vulnerable incumbent senators of the 2020 cycle, so much so that he faces a competitive primary from North Carolina Republican Garland Tucker III.
The seat Tillis currently holds is well-known for trading hands from one single-term incumbent to the next.
Tillis won the seat in 2014 by defeating one-termer Kay Hagan (D-NC), who took the seat from Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R-NC) after Dole’s single term. Before Dole, the seat had been in Republican hands for decades with Sen. Jesse Helms.
The nominees of both parties for this seat going forward will be decided in March 2020.

372,Former Acting FBI Chief: No Equivalence on How Hillary and Trump Acquire Opposition Info from Foreigners,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/former-acting-fbi-chief-no-equivalence-on-how-hillary-and-trump-acquire-opposition-info-from-foreigners/,"Some Republicans are feverishly attempting to defend Donald Trump’s shocking comments that he would accept political dirt on his opponents from foreign powers by saying, “Hillary Clinton did the same thing.”
The only problem is that just isn’t true, according to the official who headed the FBI in the interim after Trump fired Director James Comey.
Certain top Republicans, including Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, are pointing a finger at Clinton because her 2016 presidential campaign hired the firm FusionGPS to conduct opposition research against Trump. The firm ultimately hired British operative Christopher Steele to compile a dossier of dirt on Trump.

That is disingenuous and a false equivalency, said Andrew McCabe, who served as deputy director of the FBI for nearly two years, including a stint of a few months as acting director in 2017.
“There’s no equivalence between the two examples. To openly invite foreign intelligence officers representatives from a hostile foreign government to steal information, to acquire opposition research in anyway, any illegal way they might do that is one thing. For a campaign to hire a law firm, an American law firm that then turns around and hires an American research company that then contracts out with a foreign individual, that is not illegal,” said McCabe, who worked his way up the FBI over about 20 years before becoming a favorite political target of Trump’s before being fired for alleged wrongdoing which McCabe said were politically motivated allegations.
“Campaigns are allowed to hire individuals, foreign individuals and to pay those individuals for the services that they provide and I would add too, Chris, that the example of the Clinton campaign it is that very foreign individual that stepped forward and provided the information he had collected to the FBI because he was so troubled by what he was seeing,” McCabe added in an on-air interview with CNN host Chris Cuomo. “It’s odd that a foreign individual involved in the campaign process was familiar enough with the threat and with the concerns that that information posed that he stepped forward and provide it to the FBI and not something obviously that the president and his staff would be willing to do.”

373,Former GOP Rep: Trump’s Saying that He’d Accept Info from a Foreign Power Is an ‘Impeachable Moment’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/former-gop-rep-trumps-saying-that-hed-accept-info-from-a-foreign-power-is-an-impeachable-moment/,"When Donald Trump announced from the Oval Office that he would accept political dirt from foreign sources this week, he unambiguously became unquestionably impeachable, according to a former Republican member of Congress from Florida.
Trump ignited a new political firestorm when, during an on-camera interview with ABC News, he said that he would look at political dirt on his opponents from foreign powers, if offered–without necessarily alerting the FBI.
Former Rep. David Jolly (D-Fla.), who has been an outspoken critic of Trump, was unequivocal in how Congress must respond to the president’s statement.
“Yeah, he has conditioned us to accept moments like today, and we almost don’t feel the outrage we should. And, Brian, I think today’s moment, taken in isolation, what the president said behind the Resolute Desk, in and of itself is an impeachable moment,” Jolly said in an on-air appearance with MSNBC host Brian Williams. “This was not the president of the United States being cavalier. This was Donald Trump suggesting he’d be willing to engage in a commission of a crime to benefit his own re-election. That he would entertain collusion, if you will, support from even an adversary for his own benefit, in an adverse interest to our democracy. And the eyes of the nation tonight must look to Nancy Pelosi.

“It is not her fault that this moment has occurred. She did not have a hand in Donald Trump’s behavior, but she occupies the highest constitutional office outside of the White House. This is the moment where we’re begging for leadership,” Jolly added. “I understand Speaker Pelosi is tired of this. She said yesterday she doesn’t even want to speak about Donald Trump. The nation is weary right now of this. We can’t feel the outrage on a daily basis.”
A growing number of Democrats (and one incumbent Republican congressman) are calling for Trump’s impeachment, but Pelosi has strenuously worked to avoid that outcome to this point, calling it divisive to the nation.

374,McConnell Admits GOP Willing to Deny Americans Their Rights to Avoid ‘Two New Democratic Senators’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/mcconnell-admits-gop-willing-to-deny-americans-their-rights-to-avoid-two-new-democratic-senators/,"Donald Trump has found himself in the midst of a political firestorm this week for revealing that he would consider taking political dirt against his opponents from a foreign source.
Less publicized perhaps, however, is the fact that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell finally–after decades of lies of obfuscation and downright falsehoods–told the truth why Republicans are happy to deny basic American rights to the 630,000-plus residents of the District of Columbia.
DC residents are the only Americans who are required to pay federal taxes but–because DC is not a state–have no voting representation in Congress.
They have elected Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, but while she can make all the speeches that she wants, she has no vote.
It seems to me that we fought our first war a couple centuries back against that very tyranny. We called it “taxation without representation.”

DC residents, city officials and their allies have been laboring to rectify the situation for well more than 30 now. They’ve tried to have DC statehood recognized for nearly that long.
Opponents, largely Republicans, have stymied these efforts at every turn. And–up to now–they’ve done so with technical, lawyerly and supposedly high-minded arguments.
The worst was that offered a number of years ago by then-Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex) when she said, essentially, “DC doesn’t need its own senators, you have all 100 of us here to look out for you.”
I’ve never heard anything so condescending, patriarchal–and disingenuous.
If there ever was a conflict with the priorities of District residents and the folks back home, who did you think Hutchison sided with? Yeah, of course, better believe it was the Texans who could actually vote for her.
DC became so vexed that city officials chose to add “Taxation Without Representation” to DC-issued license plates.

But now on Laura Ingraham’s show on Fox News, McConnell finally got honest with what we all knew is real reason Republicans are pleased to impose taxation without representation on their fellow Americans. It’s simply that DC residents vote overwhelmingly for Democrats.
“They plan to make the District of Columbia a state. That would give them two new Democratic senators,” he said.
McConnell is just as wrong to hold his view as Trump is to hold his on getting political dirt from foreign powers.
The only correct, patriotic and intellectually honest answer is to provide DC with the full representation that all taxpaying Americans enjoy and have come to expect. If Republicans don’t want Democrats to hold those congressional and Senate seats, then fight for DC’s voters.
And just as conservatives should be just as outraged by Trump’s comments as anyone, all Americans should be just as bothered and outraged as are citizens of DC.
This is an issue which should matter to all Americans, not only those who reside within the District of Columbia.

375,Experts on Trump Saying He Will Still Accept Intel from Foreign Nations: It’s a Welcome Mat,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/experts-on-trump-saying-he-will-still-accept-intel-from-foreign-nations-its-a-welcome-mat/,"Donald Trump’s bombshell admission that he would openly accept foreign help to influence next year’s presidential election prompted an outcry of shock and deep concern.
In an interview with ABC News Wednesday from the Oval Office, Trump said that he would look at political dirt on his opponents from foreign sources–and would do so without necessarily contacting the FBI.
“The Russians are doing — they’re going to repeat what they did in 2016. They’re going to repeat it in 2020 and now what President Trump has done is encouraging them to do so,” said James Clapper, who served as director of national intelligence for President Barack Obama. “Again, it’s just — it’s — it’s stunning.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump’s admission “an insult to our democracy.”
What Trump is saying on this matter sets a poor example for young people, said progressive activist and CNN commentator Van Jones.

“The power of the example of the president to tell the whole world, to tell children and students who are listening right now, ‘Hey, listen, yeah, I might tell the FBI, but first I want to get the dirt. That’s just how the world works,'” Jones said. “He’s making the world worse by saying that. He’s driving down the standards by saying that.”
Trump has been hinting at this for some time, as his defense over cooperation with the Russians in the 2016 campaign has shifted over time, said Juliette Kayyem, CNN national security analyst.
“That’s the businessman Donald Trump which you can ask yourself, ‘Why did he never call the FBI if he saw something illegal showing that he has never morphed into the commander in chief and the person the Constitution expects to protect the United States democratic system. So I’m kind of over shock at this stage,” she said. “In other words, this has been — this has been hinted at for a long time by the Trump people. First defying the meetings then the meetings were about adoptions. Then they said the meetings didn’t matter and then they said well, they mattered but not that much. And now they’re the meetings are totally fine. Let’s have future meetings.

“They’ve been laying this out, quickly to think about it both in terms of offense and defense,” Kayyem added. “Offense is this is a welcome mat. It’s a come, hid, they’re not just for the Russians but for the Chinese and not just for Donald Trump but for every Republican running that he wants to win in the House or Senate.”

376,"Bernie Sanders: People Like Trump Are Also Socialists, But They Are Corporate Socialists",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/bernie-sanders-people-like-trump-are-also-socialists-but-they-are-corporate-socialists/,"While Donald Trump and his Republican allies frequently tag Democrats as socialists, they actually are merely socialists of a different sort: corporate socialists, according to Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is one of nearly two dozen candidates running for president as a Democrat.
“Trump are also socialists except they are corporate socialists. They are prepared and do provide hundreds of billions of dollars every single year in subsidies, and tax breaks to large corporations and the wealthy. Anderson, you will remember very well the Wall Street bailout and Wall Street is the epitome of unfettered capitalism except when the greed and behavior nearly destroyed the economy,” Sanders said in an on-air interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “They went begging and they said we need help, give us $700 billion from the treasury and trillions of dollars in low-interest loans from the Federal Reserve.”

The major oil companies are another guilty party, taking billions of dollars in tax breaks annually, Sanders added.
“You got the fossil fuel industry today which is literally destroying the planet and they get billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks,” he said. “You have Amazon owned by the wealthiest person in this country. Jeff Bezos made $11 billion last year and that’s what Amazon made in profits. They didn’t pay a nickel in federal income taxes.
“Donald Trump himself as part of his housing endeavors received tens and tens of millions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks,” Sanders added. “So you do have socialism in this country except as Martin Luther King reminded us, it’s individualism for the poor.”

377,"Top Democrat: US Southern Border Today, ‘by Every Measurable Standard,’ Is Much Less Secure than When Trump Took Office",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/top-democrat-us-southern-border-today-by-every-measurable-standard-is-much-less-secure-than-when-trump-took-office/,"While Donald Trump and his Republican allies regularly blame Democrats for a so-called crisis at the southern border of the United States, a top Senate Democrat has turned the tables by pointing the finger back at Trump for border insecurity.
Meanwhile, independent fact-checking confirms Trump has been exaggerating the problems with immigration through the border with Mexico.
Trump has long thumped Democrats for not going along with his plan to build a wall along the southern border as a means to curtail immigration.
However, at a hearing Tuesday, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, pointed his finger at mismanagement by Trump and members of his administration.
“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department,” Durbin said of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “We have before us today an acting secretary who’s been on the job for more than two months. We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership of the Department of Homeland Security.

“In fact, every position at DHS with responsibility for immigration and border security is now being held by a temporary appointee who’s not been confirmed by the Senate,” Durbin added. “The White House has not even submitted nominations for these positions. Despite all of President Trump’s tough talk and meanness, our southern border today by every measurable standard is much less secure than when he took office.”
Democrats have, for some time, criticized Trump for such cruel anti-immigration policies as family separation in which immigrant children were forcibly removed from their parents.
At the same time, an independent fact-checking organization finds that Trump has been exaggerating the immigration situation through Mexico, particularly as it relates to immigration from the “Northern Triangle” nations of Central America.
“Mexico has consistently been apprehending and deporting people in large numbers since the implementation of the Southern Border Program in 2014,” Rachel Schmidtke, program associate for migration at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, told FactCheck.org.

378,‘The Strongest Candidate Right Now Is Joe Biden’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-strongest-candidate-right-now-is-joe-biden/,"After a week in which he appeared to stumble over whether he supports federally funded abortions and other issues, Joe Biden roared into Iowa Tuesday to return taking his fight directly to Donald Trump.
“There’s a lot of ways Trump fails the basic standard to be president — but one of them is this: Donald — it’s not about you. It’s about America,” Biden exclaimed. “Everywhere we turn, it’s clear that Trump is shredding what we believe in most. I believe we have to restore those basic values. I gather some people think that’s a return to the past.
“I don’t see it that way. I see it as embracing the enduring values that have made America,” Biden added. “I don’t think that’s taking us into the past. For me, it’s the only way America is going to have a future.”
Observers noted both that Biden’s strategy of staying above fray from his many Democratic rivals and concentrating his rhetorical fire on Trump could well be smart–but also holds risk.

“What we see from the remarks that Joe Biden’s campaign released today he’s planning on calling back and saying that [Trump is] an existential threat to the country, that he employs childish tactics, that the cashier at Target knows more about the economics in the country than does Donald Trump,” said CNN Political Director David Chalian. “That’s an approach that Hillary Clinton tried as well. It didn’t work for her. Maybe Joe Biden will have more success with it, I don’t know, but it’s one approach.”
However, John Kasich, the former Ohio governor who ran for president himself in 2016 against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, said Biden’s plan certainly is the right one.
“That’s what I would do. No, that’s what I would be doing. I would be acting as though it was a general election. And frankly, look, the strongest candidate in my opinion–and I’m not here to do anything other than to give you my analysis–the strongest candidate right now is Joe Biden,” Kasich said. “He has to watch if he has gas. They’re starting to attack him that he’s too old, but you know what? Donald Trump is three years younger. It’s not like he’s 20 years younger. And age is different today. So I think for Joe Biden to be presenting himself as the standard bearer against Trump, I happen to think it’s really smart strategy.”
Finally, Biden will continue leaning on his association with President Barack Obama, as Obama’s vice president.
“The news of his speech tonight in Davenport was that while all the Democrats last weekend were at that cattle call getting five minutes a piece to talk to the democratic activists in Iowa and Biden was getting a little bit of heat for not being there. Not only was he at his granddaughter’s graduation but his best friend is Obama’s daughter and the Obamas and the Bidens hung out together and had this wonderful families meeting together. He just casually dropped that in his speech and said, ‘Please don’t criticize me for hanging with the Obamas,'” said journalist Ryan Lizza. “He’s going to play that card until he can’t play it anymore. It’s a very powerful card in democratic politics.”

It does seem as though it is working for Biden, according to a new national Quinnipiac poll. Although the poll found several Democratic presidential hopefuls defeating Trump in hypothetical match-ups, Biden crushed the incumbent by “landslide proportions,” of 13 points.

379,Even Republicans Begin to Grow Weary of the Senate’s ‘Legislative Graveyard’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/even-republicans-begin-to-grow-weary-of-the-senates-legislative-graveyard/,"While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) has been stalwart in his vow to play “grim reaper” to virtually all legislation to emerge from the Democratic-controlled House, even some Senate Republicans are losing patience with McConnell’s near-total obstructionism.
The House has approved some 140 bills since the 116th Congress convened in January, and that number continues to rise. The legislation ranges from improving access to healthcare and gun safety, to election security and more.
However, breaking a pledge he made in 2014, McConnell now refuses to bring any House-approved bills up for consideration in the Senate, apparently in an attempt to deny Democrats any legislative accomplishment.
Borrowing from McConnell’s “grim reaper” metaphor, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has taken to calling the Senate a “legislative graveyard.”
However, the strategy has begun to wear thin for at least some Senate Republicans, who would like a chance to work on legislation.

“We have completed almost 25 percent of the time allotted to this current Congress. And what have we done? Other than nominations, which are important … we have done nothing–zero, zilch, nada,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said in remarks on the Senate floor on May 22.
In those same floor remarks, Kennedy added, “I am saying we need to do more.  There are issues where our Democratic friends and my Republican friends have more in common than we don’t. We need to bring the bills to the floor of the Senate. Everyone has their own list, and everyone in the Senate knows what I am talking about, whether they will say it or not.” 
Interviewed that same day on MSNBC about his remarks, Kennedy was asked why he hasn’t rectified his concern over lack of legislating.
“Because I can’t bring a bill to the floor of the Senate. Only the majority leader can,” Kennedy replied.
Amplifying his thoughts further, Kennedy was quoted on Monday by Politico, saying, “We ought to be less risk-averse. And I don’t think I’m the only one who believes that. I just think I’m just the only one foolish enough to say that.” 
Kennedy is not the only GOP member to feel this way.
The Hill on May 24 reported: “Asked how he felt about the pace of legislation in the Senate this year, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) shot back: ‘What legislation?’ ‘So it’s pretty slow, isn’t it?’ he asked.” 
Politico this week quoted other frustrated Republicans speaking out, as well, including Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.
“I appreciate the fact that we have to do the personnel side of the business,” Murkowski said. ‘But as one that wants to get to the policy, I’d like us to be moving on some of these pieces of legislation.”

Potentially vulnerable senators in next year’s elections, such as Sen. Cory Gardner, also told Politico that they’re speaking up.
Politico reported: “Gardner said he had encouraged McConnell ‘to vote on more things, to have more debates.’”

380,"CNN Iowa Poll Shows that Abortion, Climate Change and Guns Are the Top-Driving Issues",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/cnn-iowa-poll-shows-that-abortion-climate-change-and-guns-are-the-top-driving-issues/,"A new CNN/Des Moines Register poll offered both good and bad news for Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, while also laying out the top issues for Democratic voters.
“We asked Biden supporters, ‘Are you extremely enthusiastic about this choice?’ Twenty-nine percent of them said they are. Compared to the rest of the candidates combined, we are at 39 percent that say they are enthusiastic about the choice. So there is a bit of an enthusiasm gap there,” said CNN Political Director David Chalian.
“We also checked in on this issue of electability, and when we asked Iowa Democrats, ‘Are you looking for someone who can beat Trump or for someone to agree with you on the issues,’ it’s not even a close contest. Take a look at that: 65 percent want someone who has a strong chance to win. Thirty-one percent shares your issue position,” Chalian added.
“And in brand-new numbers releasing right now in this next installment of our CNN/Des Moines Register Iowa poll, we looked at the qualities that some of these candidates have, personality traits if you will, to find out which one voters thought was the biggest advantage,” Chalian continued. “Look at this: Washington experience comes out on top. Fifty-two percent say that is an advantage for the candidate. That’s good news for Joe Biden. But look at the bottom end of that scale. Only 1 percent said being over the age of 70 is an advantage. So there is perhaps a negative potentially for Joe Biden.”

The pollsters also asked about issues–“What’s driving you to support someone?”–Chalian added.
“What’s most important? Look at that: The right to an abortion — 79 percent call it a must-have. Climate change as the greatest threat — 75 percent. Restoring an assault-style weapon ban — 57 percent. Abortion, climate and guns are the top-driving issues.”

381,"Google CEO: New YouTube Restrictions Coming, We Want To ‘Really Prevent “Borderline” Content’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/media-press/google-ceo-new-youtube-restrictions-coming-we-want-to-really-prevent-borderline-content/,"Google’s CEO said he wants to see YouTube expand its crackdown on content.
The company’s chairman, Sundar Pichai, said he’s hoping to take Google’s model of prioritizing of “quality content” over to YouTube.
Pichai spoke with Axios’ Ina Fried, who expressed concern the tech company wasn’t taking a harder line against offensive content, pointing out a video she had seen of a “teenager who appeared to be donning Muslim garb, spewing a lot of anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, homophobic hate.”
“I don’t know all the details of this specific video, but in general, look, I mean all of us, you know, none of us want harmful content on our platforms,” Pichai said. “Last quarter alone we removed 9 million videos from the platform.”

Pichai’s comments come as social media and related content is coming under political scrutiny in Washington, with some Democrats saying the tech companies are too large and need breaking up while Donald Trump and other conservatives accuse these companies of discrimination against conservative-oriented content.
The CEO then said he wants to expand YouTube’s view of what’s prohibited. 
“And so we are bringing that same notion [from Google] and approach to YouTube, so that we can rank higher quality stuff better and really prevent borderline content — content which doesn’t exactly violate policies, which need to be removed, but which can still cause harm.”
In a move Pichai acknowledged would be controversial, “fact checkers” will be brought in to monitor YouTube videos.
“The thing we are trying to do is to bring more authoritative sources and fact checks on videos, which may be controversial,” Pichai admitted. “It’s a case where we got it wrong, but that’s what we are trying to do and we are working hard to improve.”
The interview aired on Axios’ HBO show, Axios on HBO.
 (Editor’s Note: Axios has updated its report to note than the interview was conducted before YouTube’s recently announced restrictions.)

382,Judiciary Committee Member: ‘I Don’t Have Any Difficulty’ with Calling for Trump Being Locked Up,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/judiciary-committee-member-i-dont-have-any-difficulty-with-calling-for-trump-being-locked-up/,"A member of the House Judiciary Committee said he has no “difficulty” with saying Donald Trump should be in prison.
Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) made his remarks in response to an on-air question regarding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s comment last week that she wants to see Trump “in prison.”
“These are criminal acts, obstruction of justice, clearly impeachable offenses,” Cicilline said of the Mueller Report. “And so, you know, it’s kind of rich to hear the president complain about this when he began a campaign with ‘Lock her up’ as his bumper sticker and, you know, led an effort to delegitimize the first African-American president by claiming he wasn’t born in this country.”
Asked specifically about Pelosi’s remark about seeing Trump “in prison,” Cicilline replied, “Look — look, I don’t have any difficulty with those words. I think what we’re really — what is really at stake here is the responsibility of the Judiciary Committee to conduct oversight, to demonstrate to the American people that no one is above the law–including the president of the United States. We’re going to get to the truth and we’re going to demonstrate that this president must be accountable for his own conduct.”

383,Trump Critics: US Can’t Have a Trade Policy Based on Threats and Tweets,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-critics-us-cant-have-a-trade-policy-based-on-threats-and-tweets/,"Democrats and others are criticizing the deal with Mexico which Donald Trump arranged late last week in order to avoid imposing tariffs which Trump had previously threatened.
Although Trump appears to have won concessions from Mexico to reduce immigration as he demanded, many critics argue that the measures Mexico agreed to were actions that government would have taken anyway–and it’s not clear those measures will actually reduce immigration.
“That’s right. And it is a pattern we have seen repeatedly with this president. He sort of creates a crisis, has some sort of a fairly general resolution to it that is lacking any details,” said Mark Landler, White House correspondent at The New York Times. “And then declares victory this is what he did with the north Korean nuclear crisis in Singapore. In this particular situation, there is some very important sort of unresolved business. The most important of which I think is this concept of third stay country, the United States wanted Mexico to agree to this.

“The Mexicans have not, in part because doing so would require them to get their own Senate to ratify this measure, and I think is a great deal of concern in Mexico that announcing something like this before it is ratified would lead to a renewed surge in migrants,” Landler added in an on-air appearance Sunday. “So there are key parts of this that are unresolved, but you have to say, from an economic point of view from the market’s point of view, from the potential impact on the economy, he stepped back from the brink. I think he will probably be rewarded with a very strong market opening tomorrow morning. And in some sense he is right. He has resolved for the moment the sense of crisis. He hasn’t resolved the problem longer term.”
The United States should not be conducting its trade policy in such an erratic way, according to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), one of nearly two dozen hopefuls running for president as Democrats.
“You can’t use it to threaten. You can’t have a trade policy based on tweets. What you need is a comprehensive trade policies which represents the working people of this country and not just the CEOs of large corporations,” said Sanders. “So do we need to change our trade policies so that we protect jobs in America? Yes. Do we need to work with other countries to lift up the poorest people around the world? Yes, we do. But Trump’s erratic threats and trade policies are not the way to go.”

384,Senators Introduce Resolution Supporting Two-State Solution in Middle East,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/senators-introduce-resolution-supporting-two-state-solution-in-middle-east/,"A group of Democratic senators are introducing a new Senate resolution expressing continued support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The resolution highlights the U.S.-Israel relationship while acknowledging the Palestinian right to self-determination. It seeks to renew commitment to a two-state solution as the best way to achieve a lasting peace between the two parties, the senators said.
The senators involved include: Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, and Elizabeth Warren, along with Sens Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.).
Warren and Sanders also are among nearly two dozen running for president as Democrats.
The Trump administration’s anticipated Middle East “peace plan,” drafted by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, may not adhere to the principles of past roadmaps for peace that reflected longstanding, bipartisan U.S. policy promoting a negotiated two-state solution that supports the self-determination of both Israelis and Palestinians, according to the senators.
“The Trump Administration has never missed an opportunity to undermine a potential two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians,” said Sen. Warren. “This resolution calls on us to push towards both self-determination for Palestinians and security for Israel.”

The Democrats’ resolution notes the strong alliance between the United States and Israel, the long history of support from American presidents of both parties for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the fact that administrations of both parties have recognized settlement expansion as an impediment to peace. 
The resolution calls for U.S. policy to support preserving conditions conducive to a negotiated two-state solution, and to explicitly endorse a two-state solution as the U.S.’s goal in peace negotiations. It also notes that unilateral annexation of portions of the West Bank would jeopardize prospects for a two-state solution and could undermine Israel’s security, and that a two-state solution is the best hope to preserve a secure Israel while fulfilling Palestinians’ right to self-determination. The resolution is supported by J Street, the Israel Policy Forum, and Mercy Corps.
“The United States needs to be an honest broker in the Middle East. We need to defend Israel’s right to live in peace and security, while at the same time, end the occupation and protect Palestinians’ right to security and self-determination,” said Sen. Sanders. “I am proud to cosponsor this resolution to make clear that a two-state solution based on international law remains the best path to achieving a just and lasting peace, and is firmly in the interest of the United States.”

385,Democratic Senators Push Bank Chief To Do Away With Forced Arbitration,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/congress/democratic-senators-push-bank-chief-to-do-away-with-forced-arbitration/,"Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) on Friday sent a letter to JPMorgan Chase Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon urging the bank to eliminate a forced arbitration clause from its credit card agreements.
Despite initially removing it in 2009, JPMorgan Chase has recently informed its customers of updated account terms that now, once again, include a forced arbitration clause. The new provision will be imposed on consumers unless they send Chase a physical letter within 60 days of receiving the notice.
“Forced arbitration is unfair and unjust to consumers,” wrote the senators. “One of the fundamental principles of our democracy is that everyone should get their day in court. Forced arbitration deprives Americans of that basic right. It limits the ability of consumers to seek justice and accountability before a judge or jury, and it prevents consumers from banding together to increase their power through class action lawsuits.”

A copy of the letter can be found here.
JP Morgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and ranked sixth-largest in the world with recorded assets of approximately $2.6 trillion.
Harris also is one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for president.

386,"After Abrams Campaign: ‘Suppression Is Real,’ ‘You’ll Clearly See that Georgia Is Blue Again’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/after-abrams-campaign-suppression-is-real-youll-clearly-see-that-georgia-is-blue-again/,"More than six months later and Democrats continue to be haunted by Stacey Abrams’ razor-thin loss to become governor of Georgia–and the first African American woman elected governor anywhere in the nation.
What so angers Democrats is what they see as systemic suppression of African American voters in that election, on the part of Republican Brian Kemp who simultaneously served as the GOP candidate for governor and as secretary of state in a position to oversee his own election.
“Stacey Abrams ought to be the governor of Georgia. When racially motivated voter suppression is permitted, when districts are drawn so that politicians get to choose their voters instead of the other way around, when money is allowed to outvote people in this country, we cannot truly say we live in a democracy,” said Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., and one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for president.

Among the irregularities flagged as voter suppression in Georgia’s 2018 gubinatorial election were 3,000 people who were wrongly flagged by the state as being ineligible to vote, and 53,000 voter registrations were delayed by Kemp’s office without adequately notifying the applicant.
In the end, Kemp was elected governor by a margin of less than 55,000 votes over Abrams out of approximately 3.9 million in total cast.
“I think that we all have to make our own decisions. And I can’t begin to — to speak for what her decision-making is. I know that she’ll do what she thinks is best for herself,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) said of Abrams and Abrams’ future. “But I think the reality is that suppression is real. But more importantly, we can’t stay home and we can’t rely on thin margins. We have to get more people registered to vote. We have to actually turn out more people to vote. Because when you rely on thin margins, then there is always going to be a question on — on what could have happened, but we have to put the work in and people have to recognize that elections matter. When you look at the thin margin of the last presidential election, and you look at where our country is now, it matters.
“My race for mayor in Atlanta almost 100,000 votes cast, 832 votes made the difference,” Bottoms said. “And so I think if we register, continue to register more people and turn out more people to vote, then I think that you’ll — you’ll clearly see that Georgia is blue again.”

387,Ocasio-Cortez Says She’s ‘Encouraged’ By Unlikely Bipartisan Talks with Ted Cruz: ‘Super Bizarre’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-says-shes-encouraged-by-unlikely-bipartisan-talks-with-ted-cruz-super-bizarre/,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said she is “encouraged” by her ongoing legislative efforts with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex), even while acknowledging that it is “super bizarre” to be working with such a conservative legislator.
Ocasio-Cortez and Cruz are working on drafting legislation which would ban for life any former member of Congress from becoming a lobbyist.
The duo’s effort began uniquely enough. The pair are known as regular antagonists on Twitter but in this case their tweets led to common ground and a partnership.
“And what we found was that out of all these members, only two are actual registered lobbyists. So there’s still a question here that we’re trying to figure out in this collaboration, is: How far he’s willing to go. Is it just a matter of the law or is he serious about really banning lobbying in spirit? So I’m really looking forward to seeing where and how far they’d be willing to move on that. And I’m encouraged.”
Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex), who represents the Austin area, once worked as Cruz’s chief of staff, “and he reached out to us as well,” said Ocasio-Cortez, who has been chiefly known in her brief tenure as the leader of the progressive Green New Deal.

“You know, I think there’s some wiggle room here. It’s super bizarre, really weird. I never thought in my life that one of my first pushes would be alongside Ted Cruz, but I think it really shows what the true spirit of not being partisan is, and that bipartisanship doesn’t mean let’s come together to go to war and lower taxes on the rich,” she said. “But bipartisanship means: Okay, I will swallow all of my distaste in this situation because we have found a common interest. And common cause, I think, can transcend partisanship and I think that’s the way that we should go.”

388,"Pelosi Slams Sluggish Jobs Report, Saying Trump Policies ‘Hollowing Out’ US Economy",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/pelosi-slams-sluggish-jobs-report-saying-trump-policies-hollowing-out-us-economy/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed Donald Trump and his policies for a new federal report which found US employers added a paltry 75,000 jobs in May.
The jobs report, out Friday, is a significant slowdown from the 224,000 jobs added the prior month and indicates potential skittishness over Trump’s imposition of tariffs. The government’s unemployment rate remained at a 50-year low of 3.6 percent. Wage growth was disappointing, however.
“The May jobs report is a disturbing sign that the Administration’s disastrous special interest agenda is hollowing out our economy, fueling instability and jeopardizing the financial security of working families across America,” Pelosi said in a statement.
“While the wealthy and well-connected enjoy massive windfalls from the GOP Tax Scam for the rich, countless hard-working Americans are one unexpected expense away from financial ruin,” Pelosi added. “Families across the country need decisive action to strengthen their health and financial well-being, not more special interest giveaways and reckless threats from the President that threaten to sow chaos in our economy.”

House Democrats are working to move the US economy in a different direction, the speaker said.
“House Democrats are fighting For The People, delivering results on issues that matter in their lives,” Pelosi said. “Our House Majority is acting to lower the price of prescription drugs and protect health benefits for Americans with pre-existing conditions, to raise wages by rebuilding America with bold investments in green, modern, job-creating infrastructure, and to clean up corruption to make Washington work for the public interest, not the special interests.  We will continue to advance progress so that our communities, our economy and our nation can grow and thrive.”

389,Repealing the Hyde Amendment: ‘It’s About Equal Opportunity for All Women’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/repealing-the-hyde-amendment-its-about-equal-opportunity-for-all-women/,"While Republicans are busy enacting strict new abortion restrictions, Democrats running for president are looking to move in the opposite direction by pushing for the repeal of the so-called Hyde Amendment.
First enacted in 1976 and named for its primary sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), the Hyde Amendment is a federal legislative provision which bans the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases related to rape, incest and life of the mother.
Repeal of the Hyde Amendment would provide low-income women covered by Medicaid access to abortion services, which are guaranteed by the Roe v Wade Supreme Court decision.
“This is not about politics. What this is about is about health care, about reproductive freedom, about economic freedom and about equal opportunity for all women. That’s what this is really about,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for president.

Repeal of the Hyde Amendment would be of particular importance if, as many expect, conservatives succeed in having a conservative-dominant Supreme Court now overturn Roe v Wade.
Were that to happen, it would fall to individual states whether abortion would be legal. It would be legal in some states and illegal in others.
“Women of means will still have access to abortions,” Warren said. “Who won’t will be poor women. It will be working women, it will be women who can’t afford to take off three days from work, it will be very young women.
“It will be women who have been raped, it will be women who have been molested by someone in their own family. We do not pass laws that take away that freedom from the women who are most vulnerable,” Warren added.
The potential for Roe v Wade to be overturned and the need for low-income women to find accessible abortion services in such an environment prompted former vice president Joe Biden to change his mind this week and come out for repeal of the Hyde Amendment.
“If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code,” said Biden, who, according to most opinion polling, is the current front-runner among Democrats seeking the presidential nomination.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), another of the Democrats running for president, also supports Hyde Amendment repeal particularly for its effect on African American women along with Republican-led states enacting their new limits on abortion access.
“This assault on women’s reproductive rights is an assault on women, but it’s particularly assault on African American women,” he said. “And the Hyde Amendment to deny people through Medicaid and Medicare abortion rights, that is an assault on African American women, too.”

390,The Soldiers in the Tank: Unsung Heroes of Tiananmen Square,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/ethics/the-soldiers-in-the-tank-unsung-heroes-of-tiananmen-square/,"Thirty years ago, after weeks of student-led protests, tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square in Beijing. When the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators tried to block them from entering the Square, the 200,000 Chinese soldiers accompanying the tanks, were ordered to open fire. Hundreds of people died, possibly thousands. In the three decades since the tanks have become perhaps the most poignant symbols of the harshness of the Chinese government’s response to what is referred to by the government as the June 4th Incident and what most of the world refers to as the Tiananmen Square Massacre.
The entire episode is rife with potent imagery, gifting posterity with real human symbols of resistance and bravery. The picture of one million people packed into the square, punctuated by tens of thousands of pro-democracy placards vying for space with an equal number of bright red flags of the People’s Republic of China, a testament to the power of those people. 

Bloodied protesters, carried away from the carnage by their compatriots. Bicycles, a symbol of Beijing life if ever there was one, crushed by tank treads. Demonstrators staring down the troops sent in to enforce martial law, framed by massive white banners proclaiming “Give me democracy or give me death!” 
Above them all, one skinny man in a white button-up shirt and black pants, armed with nothing but his groceries, defiantly facing a row of tanks. 
This person, known to the world only as Tank Man, has emerged an unidentified hero; a symbol of the power of human freedom. He has become a meme, a hashtag, a faceless icon of resistance against oppression. Nowadays people around the planet celebrate the anniversary of the events by posing with bags on social media in homage to his anonymous courage.

Heroes are not so hard to come by as many people think, as Mr. Rogers may say, “Look for the helpers.” There are always heroes in every tragedy. Each horror a fresh opportunity for strangers to demonstrate the best that humanity has to offer. The events of June 1989 offered no small number of helpers, unsung heroes who offered everything and asked for nothing. 
Tank Man is one such hero, whoever he is or was. We will likely never know his name, what his purpose was, or what he said to the soldiers in the tanks he was blocking. 
Tank Man seemed to be a normal guy, going through a normal routine on an abnormal day. As he crossed the street, on the crosswalk like a normal person on a normal day, he was obviously not a part of the protests. For some reason, that we will never know and can only speculate on, he swerved halfway across the street and walked towards the lead tank. He stopped, facing the tank, and waited for it. 

The tank stopped just feet away from him. Cheers erupt from the throngs of thousands, Tank Man seems to wave their chants away. Gasps of fear and terror can be heard from the foreign observers.
The tank tried to move around him. Tank Man sidestepped in front it again. 
The tank stopped again. Tank Man climbs up onto the turret and appears to try to speak with the soldiers inside. Gunshots ring out, rifle fire emanating from nowhere in particular but further describe the chaos and danger of the situation. 
One of the soldiers waves Tank Man away and closes the turret hatch. Tank Man keeps speaking and motioning for the tanks to go the other way. More gunfire. 
The tank moves forward again. Tank Man resumes his position in front of the tank, arms at his side. The video ends there. 

We know from eyewitness accounts that two other civilians rushed towards him at this point and swiftly escorted him to safety. Two more heroes. 
There are at least two more heroes that we know of from that day but are never recognized. They too are anonymous, they too are silent, they too saved at least one life that day.
The soldiers in that tank were faced with a choice. A series of choices really. They were told to end the protests. In the pursuance of their duty, a single stubborn man prevented them from doing so. Multiple times. 
Over and over again, this little man challenged them. And every time they took the humane way out. 
The tragedy of Tiananmen Square, whatever its name, is mitigated by the humbling humanity of the men inside that tank. Soldiers are supposed to follow orders. They didn’t. Chinese soldiers spent that day and the day before shooting hundreds, possibly thousands, of unarmed civilians. These men didn’t. 
We don’t know their names. We never will. 
The world is appropriately awed by acts of self-sacrifice like those of Tank Man. Boldness in the face of possible death and dismemberment should be valorized, praised, and emulated. People like Tank Man risk their lives for others, usually strangers. 

But so did the soldiers in that tank. No one knows what happened to them afterward but nobody thinks they received promotions and accolades from their superiors. The chances are high that they were imprisoned for their compassion — they may even have been executed. 
The image of the Tank Man is not one of a solitary hero. He’s just the only visible one. There were other heroes in that picture and video, inside the tank. Risking your life to protect others is heroic but sometimes the decision to spare someone’s life is the most heroic of all. We can never remember their lives but we should always honor what they did.

391,"Conservatives, Republicans Go to War Over Trump Tariffs–With Each Other",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/conservatives-republicans-go-to-war-over-trump-tariffs-with-each-other/,"Conservatives and Republicans have erupted into a virtual intraparty civil war over Donald Trump’s plan to slap new tariffs on goods coming from Mexico in an attempt to somehow push the Mexican government to stem the immigration coming over its border with the United States.
Trump’s plan calls for imposing tariffs of 5 percent–and perhaps rising to 25 percent–on goods coming from Mexico until such time as Mexico takes steps to the Trump administration’s satisfaction to cut immigration across the border.
Not all Republicans are pleased with Trump’s approach, which carries with it economic risk.
“Well, there is not much support in my conference for tariffs, that’s for sure, but we appreciate the — we had an opportunity at lunch to talk to a number of representatives from the White House about this particular strategy,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky). “I think I can safely say most of us hope that this Mexican delegation that’s come up here and discuss the challenges at the border and what the Mexicans might be able to do to help us more than they have …”

McConnell’s Blue Grass State colleague, Republican Sen. Rand Paul, went further by predicting a congressional vote to overturn Trump’s Mexico tariffs.
“Well, my understanding is that in order to use this emergency power that there will be a privileged vote. A privileged vote means it can’t be blocked and anyone can demand it. I think there will end up being a vote on this, and I really do think that there may be enough numbers of people who think that we shouldn’t be allowing one person to make this decision, that we actually may have enough to override a veto on this,” Paul said. “And so I think it sends a bad signal when we’re trying to get a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada which the Trump administration has actually been successful with, that then to go back and say, ‘But oh, but by the way, we’ll heap on other tariffs outside.’ I think this goes a long way towards destroying the trade deal that they were so proud of.”
But make no mistake: Trump also has conservative supporters for his tariffs–and they could be fierce in unloading against Republicans who have broken with the president over these tariffs.
Lou Dobbs, a Fox Business host and ardent Trump supporter, angrily and in no-uncertain terms, backed the president on his program.
“I’ve talked with a number of people today, all of them off the record, but I can tell you tonight I fear for the republic. The Republican Party is being led on, well, in the U.S. Senate, on Capitol Hill by cowards. They don’t represent the Americans who sent them there,” Dobbs said. “… Instead, they are clearly led by multi-nationalists, big business and Wall Street and the lobbies that represent those multi-nationals and business interests. In fact, the senators are afraid the president will do exactly what he was voted in to do and what he set out to do; that is, to shut down illegal immigration and secure our southern border. To force Mexico to stop the illegal immigration that the chamber of horrors desires for its members.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who once was among Trump’s fiercest critics, today has become one of his most reliable defenders.
And, while he didn’t match the fire of Dobbs, Graham once more played that role on this issue: choosing to mostly blame Democrats for immigration issues.
“Tariffs would be tough on the economy. Borders are broken that need to be fixed. If tariffs is what it takes for Mexico to do better, I’m all for tariffs. Trump is not the problem, Mexico is the problem. Republicans are not the problem,” he said. “Democrats won’t vote to change the laws. Now, why do we have a million people coming here from Central America? They know if they read a card claiming asylum, you’re entitled to a hearing. It takes three or four years to get a hearing. We don’t have enough space so we let you go. You just have to claim asylum.
“I have a bill says you have to claim asylum in [their] home country or Mexico. You can’t do it here. We ship you back if you claim it. You can bring a small child with you, we can’t send that child back. We’ll change that law, 90 percent of this will stop,” Graham added. “Mexico provides buses to these people. Mexico is doing better. But I’m not blaming President Trump here. I’m blaming the Congress because we can’t do our job. And I’m blaming Mexico.”

392,O’Rourke Notes Media ‘Disconnect’ on Issues in Campaign Coverage,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/orourke-notes-media-disconnect-on-issues-in-campaign-coverage/,"Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke would like the news media to focus more on the issues and less on what he calls the “horse race” and “Twitter” stories.
“But we’ll have incredibly powerful town hall meeting, 10 or 12 amazing questions, people sharing their own stories, their testimonials that help us to understand some of the challenges we face on affordability of prescription medication or this crisis in opioid overdose and abuse and death. And then, afterwards, there will be members of the media who are there, especially the national media, who will ask me a horse-race question or some kind of sensational dynamic going on that does not connect to the lives of the people that we all just had a chance to listen to and to meet,” the former Democratic congressman said in an on-air interview after MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace asked him to play media critic. “So this is kind of like the question you asked about the disconnect between Twitter and what we see in these town halls. I think more engagement on those fundamental issues.”

O’Rourke jumped into the presidential race in March, largely on the strength of his 2018 campaign for US Senate in Texas, where he nearly ousted incumbent Sen Ted Cruz.
The ranks of Democrats seeking the presidential nomination have since swelled to nearly two dozen. After his strong launch, O’Rourke has fallen to the middle of the pack in most recent polling.

393,Biden: Fastest Way to End Transgender Violence ‘Is to End the Trump Administration’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/biden-fastest-way-to-end-transgender-violence-is-to-end-the-trump-administration/,"Former vice president Joe Biden pointed the finger squarely at Donald Trump and his administration for a string of transgender women murdered across the country.
“We’ve already had five, just this year, five black transgender women killed violently in 2019. It’s outrageous. It must, it must, it must end,” Biden said to applause, speaking over the weekend at a gala dinner in Ohio put on by the Human Rights Campaign, a LGBT advocacy organization. “And the fastest way to end it is end the Trump administration.”
Aside from his overall divisive rhetoric, Trump has been no friend to the LGBT community–and transgender Americans in particular.
He imposed a ban on transgender servicemembers from serving openly in the US military. Further, Trump would roll back Obama-era protection such that healthcare providers could simply decline to offer care to trans patients.

Chynal Lindsey, 26, a Black transgender woman, is most recent trans murder victim. She was found dead in White Rock Lake, Dallas, with signs of “homicidal violence” on June 1, according to police. The Dallas Police Department has reached out to federal law enforcement to aid in the investigation. As of June 4, no further details were were available.
Biden is currently the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to most opinion polling.
Biden has long been a supporter of LGBT rights. He is acknowledged as pushing his then-boss, President Barack Obama, to come out publicly for marriage equality.
Further, Biden publicly supported trans woman Danica Roem in her ultimately successful race in Virginia in 2017 to defeat a Republican incumbent to win a seat in the state legislature.

394,"Contempt Vote for Barr, Ross Set for Withholding Documents in Census Investigation",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/contempt-vote-for-barr-ross-set-for-withholding-documents-in-census-investigation/,"Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md), on Monday sent letters notifying Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the committee is moving forward to hold them in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with bipartisan subpoenas issued more than two months ago for documents relating to the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.
“Unfortunately, your actions are part of a pattern. The Trump Administration has been engaged in one of the most unprecedented cover-ups since Watergate, extending from the White House to multiple federal agencies and departments of the government and across numerous investigations,” Cummings wrote. “The tactics of this cover-up are now clear. The Administration has been challenging Congress’ core authority to conduct oversight under the Constitution, questioning the legislative bases for congressional inquiries, objecting to committee rules and precedents that have been in place for decades under both Republican and Democratic leadership, and making baseless legal arguments to avoid producing documents and testimony.
“This cover-up is being directed from the top. Several weeks ago, President Trump vowed publicly, ‘We’re fighting all the subpoenas.’  Since then, he has refused to work on legislative priorities, such as infrastructure, until Congress halts all oversight and investigations of his Administration,” the chairman added. “Although he has suggested that all subpoenas from Congress are partisan and somehow related to the Russia probe, neither claim is true. The subpoenas in this investigation were adopted on a bipartisan basis, and this investigation has nothing to do with Russia.”

Cummings sent the letters in the wake of new documents unearthed last week suggesting that the real reason the Trump administration sought to add the citizenship question was not to help enforce the Voting Rights Act, as administration officials have claimed, but rather to gerrymander legislative districts in overtly racist, partisan, and unconstitutional ways.
These documents include a secret study authored a year before the 2016 election by Thomas Hofeller, a Republican gerrymandering expert who is now deceased. One of the principle conclusions of this study is that counting voting-age citizens in legislative districts—rather than counting all persons—“would be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.” 
The committee has been engaged in extensive efforts to obtain key documents from the Justice and Commerce departments for many months, including through multiple letters, phone calls, and meetings, but both agencies have withheld unredacted copies of high priority documents.
More than two months ago—on April 2, 2019—the committee voted on a bipartisan basis to issue subpoenas for these documents, but despite repeated efforts by the committee to resolve this impasse, both agencies are still refusing to fully comply, according to Cummings.
The committee is giving Barr and Ross until Thursday to produce unredacted copies of the documents they are withholding in order to avoid a contempt vote, which would initiate the process of bringing a civil enforcement action to obtain compliance with the subpoenas.

395,Gillibrand on How To Prevent Va. Beach Shooting: ‘Ban Stocks … Universal Background Checks’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/gillibrand-on-how-to-prevent-va-beach-shooting-ban-stocks-universal-background-checks/,"Saying “Americans are feeling ripped apart by the gun death we have seen year after year, month after month,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York reacted to last week’s mass shooting in Virginia Beach, Va., which left a dozen dead.
“We need to do something about it. I think the most outrageous thing that has happened to our democracy is how much fear and division and hate has been spread,” said Gillibrand, one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for president. “I think the [National Rifle Association] is the worst organization in this country for doing exactly that. They care more about their profits than the American people.
“They care more about selling guns to someone on the terror watch list or someone with grave mental illness or someone who has violent criminal background, they are against universal background checks,” she added. “… So we need as Americans need to stand up to the greed and corruption of the NRA and we know why, it’s because of the money and politics.

“Money and politics is the name of the game, it’s why the first thing that I’ve done as a presidential candidate is put forth a very comprehensive platform for publicly funded elections so that your voice is as loud as any Koch Brothers and your voice is not drowned out by the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on negative campaign for special interest across this country,” Gillibrand added, referring to the wealthy brothers known for funding conservative causes.
“So I will do three things as president: First, I will make sure we have universal background checks. Second, I will make sure we banned the bump stocks, the large magazines, the assault rifles, the military style weapons. I will make sure we have a federal anti-trafficking law and once we get money out of politics, the NRA will end its chokehold on members of Congress who have no courage to stand up to them and do the right thing on behalf of the constituents and the American people,” she concluded.

396,"CNN Should Consider Leaving Ga. Over Abortion Law, Swalwell Says",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/cnn-should-consider-leaving-ga-over-abortion-law-swalwell-says/,"Cable news network CNN should think about following the lead of fellow media titans Disney and Netflix by considering leaving Georgia over new state-level abortion restrictions enacted by the Republican-led Peach State.
So says Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for president.
The issue erupted after Netflix and others expressed concern when Georgia joined a growing list of GOP states which have steadily enacted abortion restrictions at the state level.
“And CNN may have to move. There’s a lot of young women who work at CNN that will be affected,” Swalwell said during a town hall event broadcast on CNN itself.

A CNN departure from Georgia would be an even bigger deal than for most other media companies, as entrepreneur Ted Turner headquartered the original cable news outlet in Atlanta, Ga., from the day he launched it back in 1980. Today most US-based CNN programming originates out of New York. The CNN Center in Atlanta now only provides weekend programming.

397,"Why Despite Inaccurate Reporting, Media Trust is Rising",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/why-despite-inaccurate-reporting-media-trust-is-rising/,"Murray Gell-Mann, Caltech Professor of Theoretical Physics, Emeritus, winner of the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics, and the man who coined the word ‘quark,’ passed away last week, four months shy of his 90th birthday. 
Gell-Mann helped bring order to the field of particle physics in the 1950s and 1960s — a time when a bewildering array of new particles was being found in “atom-smashing” experiments. He devised a new method for sorting the particles into simple groups of eight, based on their electric charge, spin, and other characteristics. Gell-Mann termed his method the “eightfold way” after the Buddhist Eightfold Path to enlightenment, and for this research and related work he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.

I take it for granted that pretty much anyone whose name is associated with Theoretical Physics is smarter than me and probably just about anyone I’ve ever met. I’m not particularly stupid. Neither are you. We’re just ignorant. Professor Gell-Mann was ignorant too but his ignorance differed greatly from our, my, average ignorance.
More of us should accept the fact that most of us are ignorant about most of what happens in the world and, in fact, of the world itself. Where a person like Murray Gell-Mann differs from most of us is that he was, like most good scientists I would hope, profoundly aware of the limits of his knowledge and of the need for reliable information in a democratic society. 
I believe most Americans share my value in the importance of objective journalism but right now people think that trust in the media is at an all-time low. There’s a lot of blame to go around for this but part of the problem is that the media gets a lot of things wrong. Not #fakenews, just real stories reported by well-intentioned reporters but nonetheless filled with inaccurate information, sometimes due to bias but usually negligence or various forms of incompetence. 

Professor Gell-Mann, a scientist that he was, observed the world around him, including the media. What he noticed was a phenomenon that most people reading this probably have as well. We all have a specialty, expertise born of practice or profession, that we know well enough to teach, and that we have seen be badly represented in the media. We’ve all read or heard a story in the news and thought “Wow, this reporter has no idea what they’re talking about. I work in this industry and they’re getting everything wrong.”
This by itself isn’t terribly insightful, again, we all know someone who can explain why this reporter got health care insurance wrong or how that anchor falsely described the differences between soldiers and marines or whatever the journalistic mistake happened to be. Murray Gell-Mann thought about this and observed related phenomena. He developed a hypothesis, lending his name to a concept coined by his friend, best-selling science-fiction author Michael Crichton:
“Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray’s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward-reversing cause and effect. I call these the “wet streets cause rain” stories. Paper’s full of them.”

In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.” 
For some reason, we expect someone who was wrong about the thing we know well to be right about the things we don’t know well. The Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect describes our repetitive acceptance of repetitive incompetence and untrustworthiness. We don’t apply the same rigorous standards of research and credulity to our news diet as we do to our professional tasks and end up deliberately believing demonstrably false things. 
We expect more from our media but are much more forgiving of their errors, in fact. This may explain why a study of 3,600 newspapers across the country 10 years ago showed that only 2 percent of papers correct their flawed stories. Compounding the problem is the fact that almost exactly half of all the surveyed news stories contained more than one factual error. The media gets plenty wrong and doesn’t correct the vast majority of it.
Three years ago, a former Obama administration official explained how easy it was to mislead DC reporters around the ongoing Iran deal negotiations: 

“The average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That’s a sea change. They literally know nothing.”
To be fair, the Obama official was talking about overseas stories, which are demonstrably more difficult to cover. But the point remains for nearly every other subject as well. The news industry is competitive, reporting is complicated, and there is a lot of pressure to be first to print. Corners are cut, standards are relaxed, and the industry is hemorrhaging staff at unprecedented levels; all of which have been contributing to a worrying decrease in the quality of and trust in journalism. 
This narrative is incomplete however because something strange has happened in the last three years. After years of relatively steady decline trust in mass media has actually been rising. Gallup reports that since a historic low in 2016, trust in the mainstream media is up for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Contrary to popular belief, trust in the media is going up and has been the entire time Trump has been president, so far.
What are we to make of this? Some commentators have suggested that Donald Trump is so uniquely mendacious that a truth-hungry public is providing the media with an opportunity to restore their credibility. This ignores, however, the fact that trust in mass media for Republicans is going up as well.

This may be where the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect has some explanations for us. Most every one of us will be awful judges of veracity for reporting on subjects that we are not expressly educated or experienced in and will happily buy whatever the non-expert reporter is selling. We forget that generally unless they’re specialists in the field, journalists don’t know what they’re talking about and can really only repeat what others have told them. (The problem identified and exploited by that former Obama official and politicians throughout history —  and I’m sure well into the future.) 
Much like the Dunning-Kruger effect, the MGM Amnesia effect is a cognitive bias and a psychological safety mechanism. We want and need to believe that we have a trustworthy news industry; conveniently forgetting about the manifold inadequacies of that industry protects us from acknowledging that most of us really have no idea what the hell is going on. We accept the facts and go on with our lives. 
So why is trust in the media going up? 

Maybe because the election of 2016 and the subsequent two years of breathlessly inane and cartoonish behavior by the 45th president have shocked us so badly that we desperately yearn for objective gatekeepers of democracy and are willing to forgive past inaccuracies. This is a popular theory.
Perhaps because the election of 2016 and the years since are as noticeable as much for the egregious half-truths and blatant lies of the media as of those of President Trump. Maybe we have been so stunned by the consistently inaccurate reporting on Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Jussie Smollett, Russia, and a host of other things that we’ve adopted a curious form of Stockholm Syndrome and convinced ourselves to ignore the evidence before us.
Or it’s the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect and we just forget. It’s not deliberate, just a Pavlovian response from a society that has been conditioned to suspend its incredulity and believe that Satanists are in our kindergartens. It seems as good an explanation as any other as to why we keep giving trust to a media industry which doesn’t really deserve it.

398,Don’t Blame Liberals and Democrats for Social Media Bans,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/law/dont-blame-liberals-and-democrats-for-social-media-bans/,"Democrats aren’t “banning conservatives for their political preference on social media.” The Democratic Party doesn’t own Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube. The people who run those companies for the benefit of their shareholders made the decisions.
In fact, no one is “banning conservatives for their political preference on social media’. The people being banned are being banned for violating the terms of service of the platforms, terms of service that are set up by the owners of said platform to discourage content that they believe will drive away users (and therefore damage the property of their shareholders).
(Aside: If you go to the websites of any of these conservatives who run their own, such as Alex Jones, you’ll find a fascinating thing. They have their own terms of service, which generally look very much like the ones they complain about at other sites. At InfoWars, for instance, you’ll find that they reserve the right to remove any content you post if they don’t like it, and to delete your account if you violate the terms. So if you’re really looking for “double standards,” there’s a good place to start.)

In general, if you’re a private business in the US, you have the right to choose who you do business with on pretty much any grounds you want. I say “pretty much,” because we’ve decided that there are some reasons, largely due to a history of discrimination, that can’t be used for this. Most of them — race, national origin, sexual preference — are immutable characteristics. The one exception we recognize is religion. And the law is fairly strict; to prove discrimination, you have to show that you were discriminated against because of one of the named characteristics. If you run a sports bar in Boston and have a rule that you don’t allow anyone wearing Yankees logos and a black guy wants to come in wearing a Yankees hat and you don’t let him, you’re not going to run afoul of the law.
Political affiliation or ideology is a chosen characteristic, and is not protected under the law. So even if social media platforms were kicking people off because of their ideology rather than their behavior (Narrator: They’re not) they wouldn’t be in any trouble with the law. Nor would it be a double standard, as the two things (ideology and sexual orientation) are clearly fundamentally different in that one is innate and one is chosen.

399,New Trump Tariffs on Mexico: ‘This Puts the Um in Dumb’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/new-trump-tariffs-on-mexico-this-puts-the-um-in-dumb/,"Donald Trump’s new political bombshell–a plan to levy tariffs against neighboring Mexico–not only opens a new front in Trump’s trade wars but has set off alarm bells among economists, Democrats and even other Republicans.
Trump’s plan to slap 5 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico comes just weeks after he racheted up existing tariffs against China. And under the Trump plan, tariffs against Mexico could skyrocket to 25 percent.
Furthermore, Trump’s decision to hit Mexico with tariffs wasn’t even spurred by any trade issue; rather they were imposed due to his ongoing fury with immigration across the southern border.
“The president has been so agitated by the flow of migrants at the border by the increase of numbers over the last few months, and very frustrated by the inability of his administration stop it and change the trends down there,” said Washington Post reporter Philip Rucker. “And he sees tariffs as one area where he can unilaterally act. It’s why he likes tariffs so much. It’s something he can impose as the president and put out there and pull back at a whim, basically impulsively. That’s what we’re seeing this week with this decision.
“And there’s some familiar with the patterns who say maybe the president is bluffing. There’s a period of time before they take effect,” Rucker said Friday. “Even the new president of Mexico suggested today that there’s a chance Trump could reconsider and pull back this threat before it takes place. I don’t know if that’s going to happen or not, but that’s also a consideration.”

These tariffs only will cause economic pain for Americans, according to a number of economists.
“This policy toward Mexico is incredibly stupid. It is both a tax on American consumers of billions of dollars. It is also a direct tax on American manufacturing. The people who are the most opposed to this, who are looking at each other saying, what are you talking about, are American automakers, because the cars they’re making in the United States employing thousands of Americans have high parts content that’s coming from Mexico,” said Austan Goolsbee, who served as a top economist in Barack Obama’s White House. “And it’s a tax on American car makers, not foreign car makers because more of our parts come from Mexico than Korean cars, Japanese cars, et cetera. This puts the um in dumb as they would say.”
At least one veteran Democratic lawmaker doubts Trump’s legal authority to impose tariffs on Mexico.
“Well, when I heard the news this morning, I was stunned. I thought, ‘What is this authority to do this?'” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif) said. “And when I learned it was a 40-year-old bill that requires a finding of unusual and extraordinary threat, I thought, ‘You know, once again, the president’s idea of an emergency is something that he wants to do without the legal authority, just as he did with the wall and now the courts have stopped him.’ So, I think this is very questionable legally.
“He doesn’t have a lot of respect for the democratic system of government and the rule of law here, and I’m glad to hear that Senator [Charles] Grassley [R-Iowa] is also calling him on this.”
Grassley is among those usual Trump allies who not only criticized Trump’s tariffs but warned that they could jeopardize Trump’s follow-on trade agreement to NAFTA, known as USCMA.

“Trade policy and border security are separate issues. This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent,” said Grassley, who has been in the Senate for decades and serves as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “Following through on this threat would seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA, a central campaign pledge of President Trump’s and what could be a big victory for the country. President Trump should consider alternatives, such as imposing a fee on the billions of dollars of remittances that annually leave the United States to Mexico, which only encourage illegal immigration and don’t help the U.S. economy. It could fund border security measures and would put economic pressure on Mexico without imposing a financial burden on U.S. consumers or harming American jobs. I’ve long supported reforms to remittance law, which haven’t become law because of opposition from big banks and other financial interests.
“Mexico must help get the border crisis under control and the president should use appropriate authorities to apply pressure. I’ve also called for a Safe Third Country Agreement so that Mexico cannot simply pass the buck to the United States. Mexico has a leading role to play here when asylum seekers are traversing their country without regard to the law and without consequence. Congress must also immediately fully fund border security and interior enforcement,” Grassley added. “Democrats should come to the table in a reasonable way and work to put an end to the security and humanitarian crisis on the border. I support nearly every one of President Trump’s immigration policies, but this is not one of them. I urge the president to consider other options.”

400,Dem Opponent: ‘Everything that People Dislike in Politics … We See in this New Version of Lindsey Graham’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/congress/dem-opponent-everything-that-people-dislike-in-politics-we-see-in-this-new-version-of-lindsey-graham/,"Sen. Lindsey Graham has drawn a Democratic opponent in his bid for re-election next year.
The South Carolina Republican’s opponent, Jaime Harrison, said he is running because he doesn’t like Graham’s transformation from John McCain-style Maverick, to avid Donald Trump defender and toady.
“Everything that people dislike in politics today, the political opportunism, just doing things that is in your best interest instead of in the best interest of the people that you represented is what we see in this new version of Lindsey Graham,” said Harrison, a former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. “I used to look up to Lindsey Graham as someone that even though I disagreed with him on the policy and sometimes political positions, I still thought that this was someone who was above the fray, a statesman who could work with both sides. But this new version of Lindsey Graham, we can call him Lindsey Graham 2.0, it is exactly what people hate about politics.”
Graham has noticably changed positions in recent years, particularly on Trump himself. When both men were Republican presidential candidates in 2016 and afterward as Trump was in the White House, Graham often was Trump’s fiercest critic.

However, just recently, Graham left many Democrats and others aghast as he recommended that Donald Trump Jr “plead the Fifth” in testimony before a Senate committee.
Harrison threw his hat in the ring this week and reportedly began a successful fundraising haul, bringing in about $270,000 in the first 24 hours of his campaign. That total came from about 9,500 donations, mostly small-dollar ones.

401,Missouri Congressman’s Video Aimed at Ending GOP Roadblock on Aid,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/missouri-congressmans-video-aimed-at-ending-gop-roadblock-on-aid/,"Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.) recorded this week’s Democratic address to the nation in an attempt to break the House Republicans’ logjam on legislation to provide assistance in the wake of serious natural disasters.
House Republicans have blocked the legislation–already approved by a bipartisan basis in the Senate–three times in the past week.
Cleaver opened his short address by talking about the torrential rainfall experienced this week around his hometown of Kansas City, breaking the record for rainfall in the month of May, and causing more than 300 road closures across the state of Missouri, from local roads to major highways. 
“Over the past four months, Democrats in the House have worked hard to reach across the aisle to pass two supplemental funding bills that would help address not only the needs of the Midwestern communities I’ve been speaking about, but communities in California dealing with wildfires, towns in Alabama ravaged by tornados, and Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still rebuilding from the disastrous hurricane that occurred in 2017,” Cleaver said. “Last week, our colleagues in the Senate were able to reach an agreement, with 85 senators, almost unheard-of in terms of bipartisanship in these tribalistic times, voting to support the $19 billion deal that would bring relief to American communities from sea to shining sea.

“But unfortunately, a select few of our Republican colleagues in the House have decided to put politics over the needs of the American people, choosing to object and obstruct the disaster bill while we are back home serving our constituents in the district,” the congressman added.
“These individuals understand that they are a small minority of the House of Representatives and that they are simply delaying the inevitable. That’s why I find is so unfathomable and unconscionable that they have chosen this moment to try to score putrid political points when Americans all over the country are pleading, pleading for our help.

402,Penn. Congresswoman Says ‘There Has Been a Shift’ Among Her Constituents Towards Impeachment,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/penn-congresswoman-says-there-has-been-a-shift-among-her-constituents-towards-impeachment/,"A Democratic freshman member of Congress attending a town hall meeting in her swing district has detected a noticable shift among her constituents towards impeachment of Donald Trump.
In a television interview, Rep. Madeleine Dean said voters in her district–which centers on the wealthy Philadelphia suburbs of Montgomery County, Penn.–expect Congress to simultaneously legislate key issues and conduct investigations of Trump and his administration.
“Guess what, they want us to do both and that was my great takeaway. And there’s been a shift in the conversation in my community, in my district. So last night what came up were gun violence, health care, prescription drug pricing, climate change, Social Security, cost of student loan debt, all of those important things,” said Dean, whose district has been traded between Democratic and Republican representatives for several decades now. “They want to talk about that. But I bet it wasn’t two or three questions in from the audience, then the question of holding this president accountable.
“The man asked for impeachment. That’s why I took the time to explain why I went for an impeachment inquiry,” Dean added. “The room mostly, I would say 99 percent of the room, applauded in terms of impeachment inquiry. They absolutely did. That is a shift from four or five or six weeks ago.”

Dean said that she also has noticed an increase in the interest among her Democratic colleagues in the House.
“I’ve had colleagues either call me on the telephone or stop me on the floor, as we’re involved in voting, and say, ‘What’s going on? Why is it that you made the shift a couple of weeks ago now to say that we should call for an impeachment inquiry?’
“And the thing that I say is that I feel on [the Judiciary Committee] that we are foot soldiers and then when we issue lawful subpoenas for the constitutional oversight we ought to be doing and they are ignored, blocked, thwarted by this administration, by this president, by this attorney general, enough is enough and I believe we should start an impeachment inquiry.”

403,"Kamala Harris Goes Beyond Impeachment, Will ‘Absolutely’ Go After Trump Legally If She’s President",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/kamala-harris-goes-beyond-impeachment-will-absolutely-go-after-trump-legally-if-shes-president/,"Most of the debate over special counsel Robert Mueller’s extraordinary public statement Wednesday centered around the potential for that statement to spark impeachment of Donald Trump.
One Democrat running for president took it much further, pledging that if she is elected next year, she will pursue legal action against Trump even after he were to leave the White House.
Mueller Wednesday made his first public statement as special counsel, indicating that–despite intense interest in his testimony before Congress–that he does not want to make any statements beyond what are in the report he filed in March with the Justice Department.
“On the issue of impeachment, let’s be clear. You know, I’ve read the Mueller Report and they outline in that report — and it was a team of some of the best career people in the Department of Justice who were a part of that, career people who had been in the Department of Justice,” said Sen. Kamala Harris of California. “There are at least 10 separate instances of obstruction of justice. I am also clear from reading what he wrote in that report that the only reason they did not return an indictment against this president on obstruction of justice is because of an opinion from the Department of Justice that suggests that you cannot indict a sitting president. But there is no question that the evidence supports a prosecution of that case. So taking it to the point of your next question, absolutely.

“Listen, I believe that there needs to be transparency, there needs to be accountability. There is a clear track record of this president and members of his administration obstructing justice, not to mention what we have seen from the current attorney general of the United States, who I questioned in connection with the Judiciary Committee, who clearly thinks his job is to represent the president and his peculiar interests as opposed to representing the people of the country in which we live. So there is a lot of work to do and I plan on seeing it through,” Harris added, to a round of applause during a televised town hall meeting.

404,Mueller Statement ‘Will Amplify’ Calls for Impeachment,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/mueller-statement-will-amplify-calls-for-impeachment/,"Although House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has long had an attitude that she would “rather stick a fork in her eye” than pursue impeachment of Donald Trump, special counsel Robert Mueller’s extraordinary public statement Wednesday may well change all of that.
“Yeah, the message really is: ‘Over to you, Congress.’ Look, a lot of people were waiting to see if Mueller would charge the president. What he reminded everyone, he is part of the [Justice Department] that says you can’t, which means his option wasn’t ‘charge or don’t charge.’ It was: ‘Clear or don’t clear’ the president,” said Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for president. “And he made a decision to not clear the president based on the evidence he gathered.
“He made clear that the procedures in the DOJ won’t be enough to establish accountability, but procedures do exist for a sitting president to be held accountable,” Buttigieg added. “And if the Justice Department can’t charge a sitting president with an actual crime, then it goes over to Congress to decide whether they charge the president with a high crime. This is as close to impeachment referral as you get under the circumstances.”
Mueller Wednesday made his first public statement since finishing his investigation as special counsel, indicating that–despite intense interest in his testimony before Congress–that he does not want to make any statements beyond what are in the report he filed in March with the Justice Department.

Mueller’s team did not find enough that rose to the level of criminal conspiracy in any collusion between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign. Moreover, on obstruction of justice, Mueller said that he was not exonerating Trump. However, because of the Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president, Mueller said he felt he could not charge Trump.
“Today was the first day that we have heard from Mueller himself in his own words, and honestly, the consequence of hearing from him today for the first time is I think what is now the widely held expectation that the Democratic-controlled Congress will have no choice but to open an impeachment inquiry into President Trump,” MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said on her program Wednesday night. “Not because they want to. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been blunt and consistent and insistent in making sure she would frankly rather stick a fork in her eye, but now we know that what Congress didn’t fully appreciate when they all initially cheered the appointment of Robert Mueller, when they praised him personally, when they praised the decision of the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to look into this matter, what I think Congress didn’t fully grasp at the time was that the regulations under which Mueller was appointed meant that if this investigation turned up serious evidence of serious misconduct, if it turned up evidence of potentially criminal behavior by the president, the only and inevitable outcome of that determination by the special counsel would be that Congress themselves would have to do something about it.”
Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee and another Democrat running for president, agreed that Mueller’s statement seemed to be setting up impeachment in the House.
“It certainly, I think, will amplify those calls. It’s a road that I’ve always said that we’re going to be on and end up at anyway. But taking a step back, the call that I also heard from Mr. Mueller was for every American to care about what the Russians did,” Swalwell said. “That includes you, Mr. President, because he is the only leader in our country who has not acknowledged what the Russians did to our democracy. I also believe there’s a call for future presidents to get rid of the DOJ rule that says a president cannot be indicted. I have said that if I win, day one, I will tell the DOJ to lift that policy. I hope every Democratic nominee makes that pledge.
“No president should be immunized in the way that this president has been immunized because he would be indicted right now is what the special counsel told us,” Swalwell added.

405,Amash at Town Hall: We Cannot Let Trump’s Actions Go ‘Unchecked’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/amash-at-town-hall-we-cannot-let-trumps-actions-go-unchecked/,"The first Republican member of Congress to come out in favor of impeaching Donald Trump described how he arrived at that decision at a hometown town hall meeting in Michigan.
Rep. Justin Amash made headlines when he joined Democrats seeking Trump’s impeachment.
Amash, who has been subjected to harsh criticism from his his GOP colleagues for his decision to speak out, came to his decision after reading the publicly available, redacted report compiled by special counsel Robert Mueller.
“But, I think it’s really important that we do our job as a Congress, that we not allow misconduct to go undeterred. That we not just say, ‘Someone can violate the public trust and that there are no consequences to it,'” Amash said. “And if you get a chance, I encourage you all to read the tweet where it lays all of this house. Mueller’s report lays all of this out. And I’m confident that if you read Vol. II, you’ll be appalled at much of the conduct. And I was appalled by it.
“And that’s why I stated what I stated. That’s why I came to that conclusion, because I think we can’t go — we can’t let conduct like that go unchecked,” Amash added. “Congress has a duty to keep the president in check … “

At the town hall, Amash won applause as he defended his choice in an interchange with a female constituent wearing a red, pro-Trump MAGA cap.
“First, I have one of the most constitutionally conservative and fiscally conservative voting records in the whole Congress,” Amash said to applause. “In fact, I have voted to spend less than any member of Congress in either chamber since I’ve been in Congress. So I voted for less spending. When I got elected as part of the Tea Party movement, people cared about limited government, they cared about fiscal conservatism, making sure that our government wasn’t spending too much. Under the current administration, spending is skyrocketing. Spending has gone way up. And Republicans, unfortunately, have not said that much about it. And I continue to vote to reduce spending at the federal level. I talked earlier about how I think we did too many things at the federal level.
“If you look at my scorecards from conservative groups, I’m at the top of nearly all the scorecards,” Amash said to further applause. “I’m not even a middle-of-the-road Republican when it comes to these scorecards. I’m at the top or near the top of every scorecards. So I haven’t changed. I’m who I said I was. I’m a constitutional, principled conservative who has stayed consistent regardless of whether we have President Obama in office or President Trump. Now, I heard your comments about the Mueller Report, but you haven’t stated any facts. What are the facts you’re disputing? I tweeted about 70 times over a course of four threads, and I have yet to see anyone really refute the points that I make in the threads. So what are the specific points you’d like to refute? I’d be happy to hear it.”
In separate remarks, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) praised Amash and said that the nation needs more lawmakers like him who would put their country ahead of party.
“Yeah, and what he has done is what we need more people in the United States Congress to do, which is to put country before party. Put country before party. We are looking at a system right now where, you know, and this is where I derive optimism but also concern. You know, the framers of our country they designed a beautiful system in terms of our democracy,” said Harris, also one of about two dozen Democrats running for president. “They designed a system where they said, ‘Okay, then they presupposed in some branch of government there might be abuses.’ So they designed our democracy, our republic in a way there would be three co-equal branches of government and then a free and independent press with the idea that each would then be the check and balance against each other.

“So when we talk about a process of impeachment, it is about the checks and balances that the framers imagined would be in place to be a check against abuses, and that is another reason why I support that process,” Harris added. “And what he is talking about is right. We must put country before party on a fundamental interest that is about the integrity of our democracy.”

406,Tester: I Have Not Seen a Democratic Candidate Who Appears Capable of Winning Back Rural America,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/tester-i-have-not-seen-a-democratic-candidate-who-appears-capable-of-winning-back-rural-america/,"Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, a moderate Democrat who just last year was re-elected to his third term, surveyed the crowded field of fellow Democrats running for president.
But despite the size of the Democratic field, the 62-year-old rancher from the Big Sky State said that he doesn’t see anyone who could speak to rural America.
Tester’s assessment is even more remarkable given that Tester’s fellow Montanan, Gov. Steve Bullock, recently joined the pack of nearly two dozen Democrats running for president.

“No, but I have seen some policies come out of some Democrats that fit that description. And I think it’s important that we stay connected with reality,” Tester said. “College is too high. We need to figure out ways to drive it down, but I’m not sure that there doesn’t need to be skin in the game if you go to college. The same thing with health care. And one other proposal that was put out said you’re going to have a job, the job’s going to pay livable wages. You just can’t do that. It’s not that easy. It would be great — it’s great to say it, but it’s hard to implement it. Let’s be grounded in common sense and move forward.”

407,Buttigieg: ‘Kim Jong Un Is a Murderous Dictator and Biden Served This Country Honorably’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/buttigieg-kim-jong-un-is-a-murderous-dictator-and-biden-served-this-country-honorably/,"One Democratic presidential candidate is rising to the defense of a rival against a scurrilous attack by Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump reinforced an attack against former vice president Joe Biden as “low IQ” while Trump was traveling overseas.
“Well, Kim Jong-un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual. He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that,” Trump said.
Trump and the autocratic Kim developed a rapport over the course of two international meetings on the denuclearization of North Korea which have yielded no concrete results.

According to most public opinion polls, Biden is leading a crowded field of about two dozen Democrats running for president.
Out on the campaign trail, Biden found himself defended by rival candidate Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind.
“My thoughts on that are that Kim Jong-un is a murderous dictator and Vice President Biden served this honorably,” Buttigieg said. “It’s just one more example, though, of the way this president tries to draw attention to himself by saying things that shock the conscience to distract us from his deep unpopularity and the deep unpopularity of the Republican governing agenda.”

408,Impeachment Advocate Steyer: Republicans Are Going To Show up in 2020,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/impeachment-advocate-steyer-republicans-are-going-to-show-up-in-2020/,"Democrats who are worried that impeachment of Donald Trump would motivate Republicans to turn out to vote in next year’s elections should stop because those voters will turn out regardless, according to a wealthy, determined advocate for impeachment.
Congressional Democrats should merely do what’s right and stand up for American values, said Tom Steyer, a wealthy financier who has held nationwide town hall meetings and paid for TV advertising drumming up support for impeachment.
Despite his efforts, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continues to tamp down talk of moving forward with Trump’s impeachment.
“I think for people who are worried that Republicans may show up in 2020, they should stop worrying, because Republicans are going to show up in 2020,” Steyer said. “If you look at what happened in 2018, the number of people who voted Democrat from four years before, in 2014, 35 million people voted for Democrats and 40 million people voted for Republicans. In 2018, 50 million people voted for Republicans but 59 million people voted for Democrats.

“What really happened was, sure, 10 million more people voted for Republicans, but 24 million more people voted for Democrats. We should stop worrying about what Republicans think and start thinking what the American people, the overwhelmingly number of whom agree with us think, and make sure that they hear something strong and positive about who we are and the values that we stand for. That’s what a winning solution is in 2020,” Steyer added.

409,Rendell: Biden’s Lengthy Record Is Not Problem for His Candidacy,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/rendell-bidens-lengthy-record-is-not-problem-for-his-candidacy/,"Although Joe Biden has come under criticism for aspects of his long record since he’s been running for president, the totality of that record actually makes the former vice president an attractive candidate.
That’s according to a former governor of Pennsylvania and ex-chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
“Yeah, there’s no question about it. But the record cuts both ways. I’ve heard a lot about problems with the crime bill, and there were problems and Joe Biden admitted those problems,” said former governor Ed Rendell, who is also a contemporary of Biden’s. “But the crime bill actually passed an assault weapons ban. It passed a ban on high-capacity magazines, something progressives die for.

“We would give our right arm for an assault weapons ban on high-capacity magazines. So I think Joe Biden has a terrific record, a terrific record if you look at the totality of his career,” Rendell added. “He has nothing to apologize for. In fact, there wouldn’t be an [Affordable Care Act] without Joe Biden. There wouldn’t be an economic stimulus without Joe Biden.”
Biden was a Democratic senator from Delaware for decades before being elected vice president in 2008.
Biden is one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Most public opinion polls have put Biden has the unquestioned front-runner for that nomination. A new poll confirms that status.

410,Tulsi Gabbard: We Are ‘on the Brink of War with Iran’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/tulsi-gabbard-we-are-on-the-brink-of-war-with-iran/,"With Donald Trump committing to send 1,500 US troops to the Middle East, the United States is moving toward a war footing with Iran, according to Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii).
“We’re unfortunately, and very concerningly, on the brink of war with Iran. These escalating tensions have brought us here,” said Gabbard, also one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for president. “And like I said, my experience as a solder having deployed twice to the Middle East, service in Congress on the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees for over six years, I’m very familiar with the region, the cost of war and where this path leads us. And the American people need to understand how devastating and costly such a war would be, how it would impact almost every part of our lives.

“It would undermine our national security, it would strengthen terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda, it would take a terrible human toll,” added Gabbard, who also serves with the rank of major in the Hawaii Army National Guard. “The cost of countless American service members’ lives. My brothers and sisters in uniform. The cost to civilians in the region. Increasing the refugee crisis across Europe and it would cost trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars that would come out of our pockets, taxpayers’ pockets to pay for this endless war, resources that we would not be able to use for things like rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.”
Trump, however, when he ran for president, campaigned against US military involvement in the Middle East, particularly the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

411,Trump’s Mental Stability Once Again Questioned,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trumps-mental-stability-once-again-questioned/,"Donald Trump’s blow-up earlier this week at a planned White House meeting with congressional Democrats has once again opened the question of Trump’s ongoing mental stability.
Trump Wednesday abruptly blew up and walked out of a meeting intended to advance a $2 trillion infrastructure plan. A short while later, Trump angrily announced that he would not move forward on the infrastructure program until congressional Democrats end their oversight efforts on him and his administration.
“Well, I have felt for some time that the mental stability of the president of the United States is in question. And I suggested invoking the 25th Amendment way back when, when he was calling the leader of North Korea ‘Rocketman,’ and trying to gin up a war with North Korea,” said Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), referring to an amendment which can be used to declare a president incapacitated and not able to carry out the job. “And I think that what we have here is someone who is obsessed. He is obsessive in his behavior in terms of talking about the investigation, about impeachment. He is also very compulsive. So there have been plenty of psychiatrists and psychologists who have observed him now for over two and a half years that have made the diagnosis from afar that he is a malignant narcissist.”

It’s not only Democrats who are voicing concern.
“The president during the campaign, we’ve said it, people closest to him told us that they feared that he was in mental decline. People very close to him told us that that he feared he was predementia, that he had changed,” said Joe Scarborough, a former Republican member of Congress and currently host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe. “You watch Donald Trump in the late 1980s, even in the 90s, you watch him now, he is completely changed.”
This isn’t the first time Trump has faced these kinds of questions. He faced them often early in his presidency until he declared himself a “very stable genius.”

412,Lawmakers’ Legislation Would Protect Abortion Rights Nationwide,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/lawmakers-legislation-would-protect-abortion-rights-nationwide/,"With Republican-led states enacting new tight restrictions on abortion access in those states, lawmakers in both houses of Congress have introduced federal legislation to guarantee equal access to abortion, everywhere.
Sens Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn), and Reps Judy Chu (D-Calif.), Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) and Lois Frankel (D-Fla), joined leading women’s health advocates to announce the introduction of the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA).
This follows enactment of new state-level laws aimed at restricting access to abortion services, particularly in Alabama which enacted a virtual ban on all abortions, threatening prison terms of up to 99 years for those physicians found to have provided an abortion.
However, the WHPA would guarantee a pregnant person’s right to access an abortion—and the right of an abortion provider to deliver these abortion services—free from medically unnecessary restrictions that interfere with a patient’s individual choice or the provider-patient relationship, according to the bill’s sponsors.

The legislation was introduced with historic support in both chambers, with 42 co-sponsors in the Senate and 171 co-sponsors in the House, supporters said.
From Roe v. Wade in 1973 to Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt in 2016, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized abortion as a constitutional right. However, anti-abortion advocates have worked for years at the state-level to pass laws meant to undermine or eliminate access to abortion care. Just in this legislative session, 34 laws that restrict and impede access to abortion have already passed in 15 states this legislative session and another 350 restrictive laws have been introduced. WHPA would stop these attacks and ensure that abortion access first guaranteed under Roe is a reality for everyone, everywhere, supporters of the legislation said.
A recent Politico-Morning Consult national tracking survey found that a majority of registered voters oppose the restrictive laws passed in Georgia and Alabama, including 59 percent of women and 55 percent of independents. The same survey also found that 52 percent oppose overturning Roe v. Wade—including 48 percent of Republican voters.
“Right now in states across this country, Roe v. Wade is under attack and millions of women are at risk of losing the freedom to make their own personal health decisions,” said Senator Baldwin. “It is past time to stand up to these extreme threats to women’s constitutionally-protected reproductive rights, which is why I’m championing the Women’s Health Protection Act. Every woman, regardless of where she lives, deserves the freedom to make her own, personal decisions about her health care, her family and her body.”
WHPA is endorsed by leading women’s health and civil rights organizations, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, NARAL Pro-Choice America, and the ACLU.

“With an alarming number of states enacting abortion bans and President Trump’s pledge to overturn Roe, we’re taking nothing for granted,” said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. “The Women’s Health Protection Act will ensure that a woman’s ability to access abortion care does not depend on her zip code, and we will work tirelessly to guarantee that in law.”

413,Trump Slammed For WH Tantrum, Clinton Kept Working Under Investigation,The BiPartisan Press,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-slammed-for-wh-tantrum-clinton-kept-working-under-investigation/,"Donald Trump was widely panned for blowing up and storming out of a Wednesday meeting with congressional Democrats trying to hash out a $2 trillion national infrastructure initiative.
Trump blew up complaining about House Democrats’ multiple, ongoing investigations of Trump, his administration and private business dealings. He said he would not work on any infrastructure plans until the Democrats dropped their investigations.
“If you want to talk about a representative government, shouldn’t leaders lead on behalf of the people as opposed to self-interest? … We cannot abandon our democracy for the sake of appeasing somebody who is completely focused on his interests only,” said Sen. Kamala Harris of California, one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for president.
It’s up to Trump whether he wants to put the work into being president during the remaining time left in his term.

“Being president isn’t another round of golf at Mar-a-Lago,” said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. “It is a tough job for any president and this president has had share of problems that he created for himself. And the question now is whether he wants to govern in the closing two years. He has the power and the opportunity and if he’s willing to use it.”
MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, a former Republican who served as an official in the White House under President George W Bush, characterized Trump’s situation as a “downward spiral.”
“He started the day deeply agitated by what he heard from Nancy Pelosi, in his mind he’s got some bond with her, whether real or imagined, where she has good manners, he thinks she treats him with respect, she does treat him with respect and it really seemed to unravel him psychologically for her to accuse him of a cover-up first thing this morning,” Wallace said on-air later Wednesday.
Even Republican David Urban, who helped manage Trump’s 2016 campaign, appeared to criticize the president by making an unfavorable comparison to President Bill Clinton’s ability to continue to work productively with a hostile Congress even during his impeachment.
In his impeachment era, Clinton signed more than 100 bills into law, including legislation in education and health. Clinton pro-actively worked to project an air that he would continue the nation’s business.
“Because Chris I heard you say like you said earlier, it is difficult to compartmentalize and keep that animus under wraps and difficult to work through those things,” Urban told CNN host Chris Cuomo. “I think Bill Clinton was extraordinary in his ability to compartmentalize during this incredibly difficult time but realistically this is a much more partisan Congress than it was back then … “

414,"Poll: American Jews Sour on Trump, Ready To Vote Democratic",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/poll-american-jews-sour-on-trump-ready-to-vote-democratic/,"Big majorities of American Jews are disappointed with Donald Trump as president and are ready to vote Democratic in next year’s presidential election, according to a new national opinion survey.
Some 71 percent disapprove of Trump’s overall job performance, 70 percent view him unfavorably, 67 percent would vote for a generic Democrat over President Trump, and 65 percent would vote for Democratic candidate Joe Biden over President Trump, according to the results of the Greenberg Research survey conducted on behalf of the Jewish Electorate Institute.
The results demonstrate that domestic issues dominate the policy priorities of the Jewish community as they determine which candidate to support in the 2020 election, as opposed to issues related to Israel, which remains the lowest policy priority of Jewish voters. The results also demonstrate that the Jewish American electorate remains overwhelmingly opposed to President Trump, motivated largely by the Jewish community’s positions on domestic policy issues.  These include immigration and health care, as well as concerns about rising anti-Semitism, gun violence, and rise of white nationalism, which respondents partially attribute to President Trump. 

Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of Jewish voters believe Jewish Americans are less secure than they were two years ago, 71 percent disapprove of the way President Trump has handled anti-Semitism, and nearly 60 percent believe that he bears at least some responsibility for the shootings at synagogues in Pittsburgh, Penn., and Poway, Calif. Two-thirds of the Jewish electorate remains firmly aligned with the Democratic Party, and there has been no change in the percentage of Jewish voters identifying as Republicans since JEI’s October 2018 poll; it remains at 25 percent.
Key Findings:
Healthcare remains a top policy priority for Jewish voters. As JEI found in its October 2018 poll, a broad majority within the Jewish community prioritize protecting Medicare and Social Security, as well as health care, above other policy issues when determining which candidate to support. These policy priorities are consistent with values long-held by leading Jewish organizations and the Jewish community overall.
Israel is the lowest policy priority for Jewish voters. What is striking in this poll, as well as JEI’s 2018 poll, is that a candidate’s stance on Israel ranks at the bottom of a list of 16 policy priorities of Jewish voters. Overall, the Jewish community continues to identify as strongly pro-Israel and views the Democratic Party as pro-Israel, but Israel remains the lowest policy priority when determining which candidate to support. Similar to the October 2018 poll, while approximately 90 percent of Jewish voters identify as “pro-Israel,” more than half (53 percent) of those polled are critical of at least some of the current Israeli government’s policies.
Anti-Semitism and violent threats to the Jewish community are a growing concern. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given recent attacks against synagogues and other hate crimes,this survey shows increased intensity and prioritization of anti-Semitism and other security threats targeting the Jewish community. Enacting gun safety laws, as well as combatting terrorism, anti-Semitism, and white nationalist threats have all grown in importance as political issues for Jewish voters compared to the October 2018 poll.
This survey was conducted online and took place May 6-12 among 1,000 Jewish voters nationally. Interviews were conducted online though a randomly selected panel. All respondents were screened for Jewish identity and current registration status, and key demographics in the final sample were weighted to reflect the Jewish electorate, pollsters said.
The margin of error is +/-3.2 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level. The pollsters noted that the numbers have been rounded by computer and occasionally will add up to slightly above or slightly below 100 percent.

415,Ocasio-Cortez Makes Case That Roe v. Wade Prevents Tech Companies from Using Facial Recognition Technology,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-makes-case-that-roe-v-wade-prevents-tech-companies-from-using-facial-recognition-technology/,"Although the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v Wade commonly is used to fight the nation’s abortion wars, a prominent freshman House Democrat is applying it toward a more futuristic privacy battle over the use of facial recognition technology.
Often seen by many Americans applied on their television screens as a high-tech tool employed by Hollywood scriptwriters to help their favorite fictional cops catch the bad guys on TV, facial recognition is a real and emerging advanced biometric screening technique which identifies an individual based on the unique geometry of their facial features.
There are currently no federal regulations regarding the use of facial recognition technology for commercial or government use.
The use of facial recognition technology by the government poses potential questions of constitutionality under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution. These questions are yet untested as the Supreme Court has not directly ruled upon the constitutionality of police use of facial recognition technology upon citizens.
In addition, Congress has found that facial recognition technology misidentifies women and minorities and a much higher rate than white males, increasing the risk of racial and gender bias.
Prominent Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York used the basic findings of Roe v Wade to argue Wednesday that the decision offers Americans a measure of privacy as it relates to use of the new technology.
Roe v Wade in 1973 established that the Constitution provides Americans with a right to privacy during a back-and-forth with Neema Singh Guliani,
Senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union during a congressional oversight hearing on use of the technology, particularly by private-sector technology companies.

“Right. So, you know, we don’t just have — because that right to privacy is alluded to, part of the case, in our right to privacy, is that this doesn’t just give us a right to my uterus; it gives me a right to my hand and my shoulders, my heads, my knees, my toes, and my face. So in some ways, part of the case, although there’s not all of it, there’s a great deal alluded to in the 14th Amendment with search-and-seizure, but in our right to privacy we also see here that this is about our entire body, our right to our entire body,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “The similar principle that keeps the legislator out of my womb is the same principle that would keep Facebook and algorithms out of all of our faces.”

416,Pelosi Cites ‘Examples of Progress’ in Trump Accountability After Briefing,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/pelosi-cites-examples-of-progress-in-trump-accountability-after-briefing/,"Although House Democrats have been increasingly frustrated as they attempt to investigate Donald Trump, his administration and his private business, they have seen several “examples of progress” in recent days, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Trump administration officials at the highest levels, including Attorney General William “Bill” Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn, have ignored multiple subpoenas from the Democratic-controlled House, to the consternation of a growing number of Democrats.
Pelosi met Wednesday with House Democrats on recent court successes and Democrats’ oversight efforts.
Five House committee chairs who are leading oversight of the Trump administration presented to their House Democratic colleagues, Pelosi told reporters after the meeting.
In particular, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) talked about a major decision Monday in federal court which was very favorable: the court ruled in favor of that Trump’s accountants must abide by a subpoena and begin turning Trump’s financial information over to House Democrats as early as next week.
House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) discussed the status of a similar court case, in which that committee is seeking Trump financial data from Deutsche Bank, a case which is being heard in court in New York Wednesday. Deutsche Bank reportedly been Trump’s primary lender for years.

Lastly, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif) briefed on a new agreement with the Justice Department on documents that Justice officials now have decided are willing to present to the intelligence panel — on the condition that the committee, in return, hold off on taking contempt action against Barr.
“So, there were three current, within the last 72 hours, examples of progress that was made to get the truth and the facts for the American people,” Pelosi said.
Another briefing, by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), on the as-of-yet unresolved matter of requesting Trump’s tax return information from the IRS, per a 1924 federal law which requires the IRS to comply.
However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig continue to flout that law by refusing to turn over the requested tax data.
“It was a very positive meeting, a respectful sharing of ideas and a very impressive presentation by our chairs,” Pelosi said. “We do believe it’s important to follow the facts, we believe that no one is above the law, including the president of the United States, and we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up – in a cover-up. And that was the nature of the meeting.”

417,"Trump Blows Up at Infrastructure Meeting, Declaring He Can’t Work With Democrats ‘Under These Circumstances’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-blows-up-at-infrastructure-meeting-declaring-he-cant-work-with-democrats-under-these-circumstances/,"Despite the fact that Wednesday was to be a bipartisan day at the White House to craft a major infrastructure initiative, Donald Trump reportedly exploded in rage and ended the get-together early with no real results.
“To watch what happened in the White House would make your jaw drop,” the Senate’s top Democrat, Sen Chuck Schumer of New York, told reporters afterward.
Trump had his own 10-minute talk with reporters in the White House Rose Garden.
“Instead of walking in happily to a meeting, I walk in to look at people who said I was doing a coverup,” Trump said, adding that he can’t work on infrastructure “under these circumstances.”
Despite this mention of a “cover up,” Pelosi actually tamped down impeachment talk for what was to be the second in a series of meetings in which congressional Democrats and Trump were to hammer out a legislative $2 trillion deal to rebuild and renovate the nation’s aging infrastructure.
Work on a plan for improved highways, roads, bridges, rail systems, electrical grids and more seemed the rare occasion where the two sides could have come together for a joint legislative win.

“For some reason, maybe it was lack of confidence on his part . . . he just took a pass, and it just makes me wonder why he did,” Pelosi said. “In any event, I pray for the president of the United States, and I pray for the United States of America.”
People familiar with the abortive Wednesday meeting said Trump entered the meeting angrily, declining to shake hands.
This has not been a good news week for Trump as a federal judge struck down Trump’s lawsuit which means financial information which he has long almost seemed desperate to shield may well begin getting turned over next week to House Democrats.

418,Democrats Vow To Press Progressive Goals Working With Trump on Big Infrastructure Plan,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/democrats-vow-to-press-progressive-goals-working-with-trump-on-big-infrastructure-plan/,"Wednesday will be a day to “press pause” on talk of subpoenas and impeachment as top congressional Democrats meet with Donald Trump and his team in what will be the second meeting toward hammering out agreement on a massive, $2 trillion program to update and rehabilitate the nation’s sagging infrastructure.
However, in a joint statement ahead of the meeting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) promise to press progressive ideas in dealing with Trump.
“Three weeks ago, we were pleased to have had a productive meeting with the President, during which he agreed to a $2 trillion plan to rebuild America’s infrastructure and to provide ideas for pay-fors. On Wednesday, we look forward to hearing the President’s plan for how to pay for this package.
“In our conversations with the President, Democrats will continue to insist on our principles: that any plan we support be big, bold and bipartisan; that it be comprehensive, future-focused, green and resilient; and that it be a jobs and ownership-boost with strong Buy America, labor, and women, veteran and minority-owned business protections,” Pelosi and Schumer said in the statement.

At issue is producing legislation which would enable renovations on America’s aging highways, roadways, bridges, as well electrical grids, sewers, telecommunications networks and other systems in order to improve economic growth and enhance quality of life for all Americans.
“America has an historic opportunity to forge the infrastructure of the future, and an urgent responsibility to create good-paying jobs, promote commerce, protect public health and public safety, and improve quality of life,” the Democrats’ statement added. “The American people demand and deserve transformative action – and Democrats are proud to work to deliver results in their lives.”

419,Fmr. Prosecutor: Trump Is ‘Quite Desperate’ To Prevent Public from Knowing What Is in His Financial Records,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/congress/fmr-prosecutor-trump-is-quite-desperate-to-prevent-public-from-knowing-what-is-in-his-financial-records/,"There are a number of “red flags” with Donald Trump’s finances as Trump reels from the defeat a federal judge handed the president Monday in Trump’s long time effort to keep his financial records under wraps.
In a 41-page decision, Judge Amit Mehta ordered Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, Monday to comply with a subpoena to turn over subpoenaed records to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
“Well, certainly, there are some red flags. And, of course Congress has also served a subpoena on Deutsche Bank to get those bank record and try to get a better understanding of President Trump’s entanglements with Russia. And we know he has filed a lawsuit to prevent that disclosure,” said former federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade, currently a legal analyst for MSNBC. “He is clearly very concerned about what those records might show. And so we know that Deutsche Bank paid $600 million settlement in January of 2017 for allegations that it was laundering Russian funds, more than $10 billion in Russian assets.
“And so I think there are certainly some red flags here. And it — it appears that the President Trump is quite desperate to prevent the public from knowing what is in those records,” McQuade added.

In breaking news Tuesday, Trump’s attorneys appealed Mehta’s decision to the federal appeals court in Washington. However, that appellate court would have to act fast as Judge Mehta refused to grant any stay, and Mazars USA will have to begin turning over documents as early as next week under Mehta’s decision.

420,McGahn’s Defiance Could Be Impeachment Trigger,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/mcgahns-defiance-could-be-impeachment-trigger/,"Former White House counsel Don McGahn’s decision–on Donald Trump’s say-so–to defy an order to testify before a congressional committee could be the line which finally tips House Democrats to begin impeachment against Trump, according to prominent Democrats in Congress.
Leaving an empty seat before the committee Tuesday morning, McGahn defied a subpoena to testify before the House Judiciary Committee about the Mueller Report.
McGahn, who had been a key witness in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, was told to skip the hearing by Trump.
McGahn’s defiance is just the latest among current and former Trump administration officials failing to heed the authority of Congress. And his absence from Tuesday’s hearing likely sets up another vote to hold a Trump official in contempt of Congress.
The committee has already voted to hold Attorney General William “Bill” Barr in contempt, also for defying a subpoena.
The White House is trying to shield McGahn from congressional testimony based on some claim of immunity, which is baseless since McGahn already offered his testimony to the Mueller team, Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI), a member of the judiciary panel, said in an interview ahead of Tuesday hearing.
“This claim of immunity, which is really a newly created claim, I think the White House recognizes executive privilege doesn’t apply since Mr. McGahn testified for 30 hours and of course, you can’t apply executive privilege after you disclosed the communications,” Cicilline said. “So now they’re making this really broad claim that essentially says the president and his team are immune from ever coming before Congress. That’s legally incorrect and certainly a court will ultimately have to decide that.

“But I think, let me be clear, if Don McGahn doesn’t testify, it is time to open an impeachment inquiry,” Cicilline added. “The president has engaged in an ongoing effort to impede our ability to find the truth, to collect evidence, to do our work, and this is preventing us really from ultimately finding the facts and doing our work in terms of oversight, and I think we now have seen a pattern where the White House is continuing an effort to really impede our search for the truth. No one is above the law, including the president of the United States, and we expect Mr. McGahn to come before the committee and testify.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, thus far, had worked assiduously to tamp down any serious moves toward impeachment of Trump, largely due to the unknown political consequences of impeaching Trump in the House with the knowledge that the Republican Senate will never vote to remove him from office.
But Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) also believes continued stonewalling could create a path to impeachment. Gillibrand is one of nearly two dozen Democrats running for president.
“Yeah, I think what the Trump administration is doing is fundamentally blocking our constitutional right for oversight and accountability over his administration. And they’re doing it aggressively, certainly ignoring the contempt proceedings against Barr is a step, telling witnesses like McGahn that they are not supposed to testify,” said Gillibrand, also in an interview ahead of McGahn’s Tuesday no-show. “You know, I think it’s something that Speaker Pelosi — she has six committees of jurisdiction now that are trying to do oversight investigations and I think she will continue to push very hard to get testimony and documents. But if the president keeps stonewalling, it may actually force the House’s hands and they might decide to start a future proceedings because they need to get access to the truth and the American people have a right to know the facts.”

421,"Kasich Blasts Trump for Pulling Out of Iran Nuclear Deal, TPP Just ‘Because It Was Obama’s’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/kasich-blasts-trump-for-pulling-out-of-iran-nuclear-deal-tpp-just-because-it-was-obamas/,"Two of the thorniest problems facing the nation at the moment actually have been created by Donald Trump and his odd, lingering resentment of the past accomplishments of his predecessor and his administration, according to a Republican former governor and congressman.
The current ongoing trade war with China and the attendant tariffs which are hurting US farmers and many other businesses is due to Trump deciding not to follow through on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, negotiated by President Barack Obama and members of his team, suggested John Kasich, who also ran for GOP presidential nomination against Trump in 2016.
Meanwhile, the nation could go to war with Iran specifically because Trump tore up the nuclear weapons deal the Obama administration set in place, in concert with several key US allies, Kasich offered.
“Again, I hate to say this, but we have a bunch of countries that are connected to us through the World Trade Organization. It is the way in which we manage this trade relationship. If you don’t have good trade relationships it can lead to conflict. The president was right to go after them from the standpoint of them stealing our intellectual property, not having a level playing field, having state subsidized businesses, but the best way to resolve this was to work with all of the nations in the West who share the same view we have to increase the leverage and the pressure on China,” Kasich said in an on-air appearance on CNN. “Furthermore, we also withdrew — we never ratified the Pacific trade agreement. You know why? Because it was Obama’s. You know what we’re doing with Iran? Because it was Obama’s. There are some things that people in the other party do that make sense. And so here we are in this trade war. It’s hurting farmers. If there’s one thing that farmers want, it’s two things. They want great weather and they want access to international markets. And they’re not getting it now. And they wake up in the morning and say: ‘What’s going to happen to my family, what’s going to happen to my business?’ It’s serious stuff, because other countries are going to fill in the gap for the things we’re not exporting, other nations will do it.”

Both the trade war with China and the standoff with Iran could have negative results which come back to haunt Trump as he seeks re-election.

422,Oversight Chairmen Warn TSA Not To Divert Agents to Southern US Border,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/oversight-chairmen-warn-trump-not-to-divert-tsa-agents-to-southern-border/,"Chairmen on House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are admonishing Trump administration officials not to go through with a reported plan to pull Transportation Security Agency workers off their core jobs at the nation’s airports, to join administration activities along the southern border.
Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the committee, and Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), chairman of the committee’s national security subcommittee, sent a letter to the TSA warning about the potential dangers of alarming new reports that the Trump administration is planning to divert hundreds of TSA employees to the southern border just as airline travel begins to increase for the summer.
“We are deeply concerned that pulling hundreds of TSA employees away from their critical missions at our nation’s airports and sending them to the southern border will weaken aviation security and significantly increase the risks faced by the American people,” the chairmen wrote.  “An obvious and enormous problem with this plan is that TSA employees already have full-time jobs, and the agency needs them to fulfill their critical mission at our nation’s airports, as well as to address vulnerabilities identified by the Government Accountability Office and the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security.”

CNN reported that the Trump administration plans to send TSA employees “to help with efforts to deal with migrant inflows on the southern border just as the busy summer travel season begins.”  Citing an internal email and multiple sources, this report stated that “TSA plans for the deployments to involve up to 175 law enforcement officials and as many as ‘400 people from Security Ops.’”  The article cited an email from one senior TSA official, who warned:  “We also understand we are accepting some risk as we enter a very busy summer.”
For the past year, the Oversight Committee has been examining airport security, and the results of this review have been troubling. For example, last month, in response to a bipartisan request from the Committee, the Government Accountability Office issued a newly declassified report warning that TSA has failed to address existing security vulnerabilities at our nation’s airports.  
“Based on our work, we have grave concerns about the wisdom of any proposal to pull hundreds of TSA employees away from their critical security mission at our nation’s airports to fulfill the President’s immigration policies,” Cummings and Lynch wrote.
Trump has been increasingly fixated on immigration on the southern border of the United States since before the 2018 midterm elections.
Earlier this year, Trump declared a “state of emergency,” so as to bypass Congress and construct the border wall he has long wanted.

423,"Sanders: ‘Beating Trump Is Not Good Enough, You’ve Got to Beat the Fossil Fuel Industry’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/sanders-beating-trump-is-not-good-enough-youve-got-to-beat-the-fossil-fuel-industry/,"Sen. Bernie Sanders said he not only has his sights on defeating Donald Trump next year but at overcoming a fossil fuel industry which has steadfastly stood in the way of comprehensive reform to grapple with global climate change.
“I think Democrats have to do a couple of things. No. 1, it goes without saying that we have to defeat Donald Trump, who in my view is most dangerous president in the modern history of this country. He’s a pathological liar. He’s a sexist, a racist, etc., etc. But that is not enough,” said the Vermont independent, who often polls right behind Joe Biden in a crowded field competing for the Democratic presidential nomination.
“If we’re talking, for example, about climate change, what the scientists tell us is that we have 12 years before irreparable damage is done to this planet. Beating Trump is not good enough. You have to beat the fossil fuel industry,” Sanders told host Chuck Todd in an appearance on the NBC News program Meet The Press. “You have to take on all of those forces of the status quo who do not want to move this country to energy efficiency and sustainable energies. Chuck, what the scientists tell us is that the future of the planet is at stake and we have a moral responsibility to make sure that our kids live and our grandchildren live in a healthy and habitable planet. That means massive investments in wind, solar, and so forth. So taking on Trump, of course you’ve got to do that, but you need a real plan to transform our energy system.”
Sanders said that he may not be the favorite of the Democratic establishment, but there are millions of Democrats not of the establishment.

“What [you] should know is that a recent poll that came out had me, if I’m not mistaken, eight points ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania. We’ve had polls which had me way ahead of him in Michigan and Wisconsin and, in fact, all over this country. The reason that we can beat, that my campaign can beat Donald Trump is we’re going to create the kind of excitement that we need to bring out the large voter turnout,” said Sanders, now in the midst of his second run for president.
“We’re going to bring out young people who not only are interested and have to fight for real climate change, they want to raise that minimum wage to $15 an hour. A fight that I have been helping to lead,” Sanders added. “They want health care for all through our Medicare-for-all single-payer program. They understand that it is absurd that young people should be leaving college 50, 60, $100,000 in debt. They want public colleges and universities tuition-free. They want criminal justice reform, they want immigration reform. And the truth is that our campaign, I think, can generate that excitement. Our generation can talk to some, some of the Trump supporters who now know that they were lied to when Trump said he was going to provide health care to everybody and then try to throw 32 million people off their health care. I think we are the campaign that can beat Donald Trump.”

424,Biden: ‘Trump Inherited Economy … Just Like He Inherited Everything Else in His Life’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/biden-trump-inherited-economy-just-like-he-inherited-everything-else-in-his-life/,"Some themes of former vice president Joe Biden’s campaign for the White House began to come into focus at a weekend rally in Philadelphia.
One such theme revolves around Biden, easily the front-runner of a crowded pack seeking the nomination for president, making an appeal for unity. Biden said that he doesn’t believe Democrats need to be “angry” to win the nomination.
“Folks, I know some of the really smart folks say Democrats don’t want to hear about unity. They say Democrats are so angry, that the angrier a candidate can be, the better chance he or she has to win the Democratic nomination. Well, I don’t believe it. I really don’t. If Democrats — I believe Democrats want to unify this nation, that’s what our party has always been about,” Biden said to cheers and applause. “That’s what it’s always been about, unity. If the American people want a president to add to our division, lead with a clenched fist, a closed hand, a hard heart, to demonize your opponents, to spew hatred, they don’t need me, they’ve got President Donald Trump.”
That didn’t mean Biden was above taking a swipe at Trump for taking credit for the condition of the US economy, which recently registered the lowest unemployment rate in half a century.

“One more aside. I know President Trump likes to take credit for the economy and economic growth and low unemployment numbers. But just look at the facts, not the alternative facts. President Trump inherited an economy from Obama-Biden administration that was given to him. Just like he inherited everything else in his life,” Biden said to more cheering and applause. “And just like everything else he’s been given in his life, he’s in the process of squandering that as well.”

425,Klobuchar: ‘Pro-Life’ Voters Tell Me They Don’t Support Abortion Restrictions,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/klobuchar-pro-life-voters-tell-me-they-dont-support-abortion-restrictions/,"The spate of new stringent restrictions on access to abortion enacted at the state level are outside of the mainstream and do not represent the opinion of most Americans, according to Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
The Minnesota Democrat, one of nearly two dozen Democrats vying for the presidential nomination, made her remarks Sunday in an on-air interview by Chris Wallace on Fox News.
Some eight states, controlled by Republicans, have in recent weeks enacted sweeping new limits on abortion with a goal of sending one or more of these state laws to the US Supreme Court with the goal of overturning the landmark 1973 decision Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal nationwide.
Perhaps the toughest, Alabama would ban abortions at any point except on matters of the extreme health of the woman and impose harsh prison sentences on any physician found to provide an abortion.
“If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, I would make sure that we are codifying Roe v. Wade into law,” Klobuchar said.
“But I think it’s really important for the Fox News viewers to understand exactly what’s happening here. These aren’t nuances anymore. This is a case where the laws that they have passed in these states would actually make it so that no one could get an abortion, and at the same time, while we would reduce the number of abortions because of making contraception more available all over the country through Planned Parenthood and other ways, they’ve also moved to defund Planned Parenthood,” she continued.

“So, this is dangerous. It is a place that we have never seen. I think people have always warned that this could happen and it’s actually happened,” Klobuchar added. “And when I talk to people, whether they are pro-choice or they are personally opposed to abortion, a lot of them, Chris, don’t think we should go this direction. Seventy-three percent of Americans don’t want to overturn Roe v. Wade.
“You have a situation here where they would actually put doctors in prison 99 years, that’s what the Alabama law says. This is a law that they passed that would mean that if someone was raped, if a college student was raped, she wouldn’t have a choice in the pregnancy from a rape,” the senator said.
“I don’t think the majority of Americans are where the Republicans are on this issue right now,” Klobuchar concluded.
On this point, Klobuchar appears correct. A new Kaiser Family Foundation poll found 65 percent of Americans want Roe v Wade maintained. Just 32 percent want it over turned.

426,The Rockiest Democratic Presidential Launch Yet,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-rockiest-democratic-presidential-launch-yet/,"It’s become a surprisingly familiar ritual this year: yet one more Democrat steps up and declares that he or she is running for president.
So, you would think that after nearly two-dozen times, the candidates would have it down and highly scripted.
And, for most of the Democratic herd, that’s just how it went.
But, for Democratic Candidate No. 23, his planned announcement went off the rails in a way that is any politician’s worst nightmare.
As the mayor of New York City, Bill deBlasio in some ways should have had the easiest campaign launch.
After all, he and his wife could make a camera-ready entrance just to walk to the street-level studio of ABC’s morning show, Good Morning America, and simply tell the entire nation he’s on the road to the White House.
And that’s where things just fell apart.

As deBlasio sat for his on-air interview, protesters just outside of the studio out on the street chanted, “Liar! Liar!”
Protesters specifically from the city police union started their own chant, “Can’t run the city! Can’t run the country!”
DeBlasio had to acknowledge that, and lamely called it “a little serenade.”
If all of that wasn’t bad enough, when they reported on his presidential campaign launch, news organizations included the results of a Quinnipiac Poll released Wednesday: 76 percent of New Yorkers don’t want deBlasio running for president.
Finally, of course, there was the de rigueur insult from the current occupant of the White House, fellow New Yorker Donald Trump.
Trump was quick to fire off on Twitter that deBlasio is “the worst mayor in the U.S.”
“He is a JOKE, but if you like high taxes & crime, he’s your man. NYC HATES HIM!” Trump added.
Any other Democrat fresh off their presidential launch would take that acid Trump tweet as a badge of honor. But after the morning he had, for deBlasio it probably felt like just one more kick in the teeth.

427,House OKs Historic LGBT Equality Bill,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/house-oks-historic-lgbt-equality-bill/,"The House approved on Friday what could become landmark legislation which, for the first time, would provide gay, transgender and others in the LGBT community the same legal protection against discrimination as ethnic and other minorities already so protected.
The Democratic-controlled House approved the Equality Act, designated HR 5, on a margin of 236-173. Eight Republicans joined all Democrats voting in favor of the legislation.
The bill would add the categories “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” to the existing Civil Rights Act to offer a broad spectrum of protection in housing, employment and more to members of the LBGT community.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi celebrated the legislation ahead of the final vote.
“It is a deeply powerful moment to be on this floor to talk about this important legislation,” Pelosi said.

Pelosi framed the Equality Act as part of an overall spectrum of effort to provide full rights to LGBT Americans, including doing away with the so-called Defense of Marriage Act (which at one point prevented the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage), the end of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the now-former policy which prevented gay and lesbian servicemembers from serving openly in the military. Still to be overturned is Donald Trump’s ban on transgender Americans from serving in the military.
Pelosi also paid tribute to a number of leaders who fought battles successfully for LGBT Americans. These range, she said, from President Barack Obama, to civic leaders in her hometown of San Francisco, Calif.
“When people say to me, ‘It’s easy for you to be for some of these things because you are from San Francisco, people are so tolerant there.’ I say, ‘Tolerant? That is a condescending word to me. This is not about tolerance, this is about respect of the LGBTQ community.  This is about taking pride.’ And that is what we do.”
Although the House approved this bill, its chances of becoming law seem slim in the short-term, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) has vowed to turn the Republican-dominated Senate into a “graveyard” for legislation from the Democratic-controlled House.

428,Schumer Calls For Iran Testimony: ‘The American People Deserve To Know What’s Going on Here’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/schumer-calls-for-iran-testimony-the-american-people-deserve-to-know-whats-going-on-here/,"With the potential for hostilities with Iran rising and uncertain, the top Senate Democrat is calling on acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford to testify publicly before the Senate Armed Services Committee.
“Earlier this week, it was reported that the administration’s national security team discussed a plan that would deploy at least 120,000 US troops in the Middle East. Today we learned that personnel were removed from the U.S. Embassy in Iraq,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Wednesday.
“The president himself initially denied that there was a plan, and then seemed to confirm the reports by saying that he would ‘absolutely’ would send troops, and if he did, ‘it would be a hell of lot more than [120,000],'” Schumer added.

A military buildup in the Middle East would be ironic, in the least, for Donald Trump who loudly criticized US military action in Iraq under President George W Bush.
“The news comes as quite a surprise to the American people who have grown quite tired of wars in the Middle East, of the loss of life and fortune when there’s so much that has to be done in America,” Schumer said. “The American people deserve to know what’s going on here. We are talking about not only putting 120,000 U.S. troops in harms’ way in this possible deployment, but also about the safety and the actions of the thousands of troops we have stationed in the Middle East right now.”
Schumer called for hearings by the end of this week but there were no signs such a session had yet been added to the Senate Armed Services Committee schedule.
“The hearings that are done in secret, do not inform the American people of what’s going on, and they are entitled to know,” Schumer said. “Because the lessons of history teach us that when these things are done in secret, behind closed doors, mistakes can be made and momentum built for a course of action that the nation ultimately regrets.
“So I’d repeat: The American people deserve to know what’s going on. If the president and Republicans in Congress are planning to take the United States to a conflict, even a war, in the Middle East, the American people deserve to know that, and they deserve to know why,” Schumer concluded.

429,"Chairmen Demand Data on Potential Threat Politicization, Particularly Iran",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/chairmen-demand-data-on-potential-threat-politicization-particularly-iran/,"Chairmen of the three House national security committees have written to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to demand a briefing and doccuments on an Arms Control, Verification, and Compliance Report, particularly as it relates to Iran. Iran has become a focus of increased tensions with the United States.
Signals have been coming from the Trump administration that hostility with Iran could break out imminently.
Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Eliot Engel (D-NY), and Adam Smith (D-Wash.), chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Armed Services Committees respectively, sent a letter to Pompeo raising serious concerns over the abuse of classification and politicization of intelligence regarding Iran and other countries in the State Department’s 2019 Report on Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments.
The State Department issued its annual report April 15 assessing the United States’ and other nations’ adherence to a range of arms control and nonproliferation treaties. As required by law, State prepared this intelligence-informed report with the “concurrence” of the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. This year’s report disproportionately focused on Iran to the exclusion of other countries with serious proliferation concerns, including Russia and North Korea, the chairmen said in a statement.
News organizations have since reported deep concerns of intelligence officers and State Department officials that the report “politicizes and slants assessments about Iran.” Moreover, State Department officials who released the report moved fully unclassified sections of the report to the classified annex, leaving an unclassified product that emphasized non-factual information regarding Iranian compliance, the House chairmen added.

In the letter, the chairmen raise concerns that the report provides significantly less unclassified information, that the administration selectively ignores facts or injects non-factual information, and that the administration has failed to file a key report to congress about Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal. As part of the letter, the chairmen request an immediate briefing and documents related to the preparation of the report be provided to their committees. 
“We are deeply concerned by recent reporting that the 2019 State Department Report on Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments, which the State Department submitted to Congress on April 15, may have been the product of political appointees disregarding intelligence or distorting its meaning in order to potentially ‘lay the groundwork to justify military action’ against countries mentioned in the report,” the letter said, in part.
“…Our nation knows all too well the perils of ignoring and ‘cherry-picking’ intelligence in foreign policy and national security decisions, as evidenced by a prior White House’s disregard of the intelligence community’s analysis on Iraq and its selective use of Iraq-related intelligence to justify the march to war in 2003.”
They also announced that the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Armed Services Committees will be conducting rigorous oversight over allegations of politicization of intelligence regarding Iran.

430,Gillibrand Defends Fox News Town Hall After Warren Rebuffs Network,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/gillibrand-defends-fox-news-town-hall-after-warren-rebuffs-network/,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York is defending her decision to appear on a town hall-style program on right-leaning Fox News after a chief rival criticized the network in no-uncertain terms.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who also is seeking the Democratic nomination, turned down the invitation Fox News extended to her and criticized the network as “a hate-for-profit racket” and “a megaphone to racists and conspiracists.” 
Fox News is known for generally supporting the work of Donald Trump and his Republican allies.
In contrast, Gillibrand decided to go ahead and accept the invitation for an on-air appearance.

“My belief is that the president of the United States needs to represent everyone, and I’m going to ask every voter for their vote, regardless of where they live, whether they’re in a red state or purple state or blue state,” Gillibrand said. “And I believe you need to meet voters where they are, and a lot of America happens to watch that network, so I would like to do a town hall so I can speak to all Americans about their values, their views, their priorities and where I stand and what my vision for this country is and my experience to actually realize that vision, whether it’s health care, whether it’s education or jobs, I have a record of actually bringing people together and getting things done.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), another contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, made headlines earlier this year when he became the first candidate on the Democratic side this year to not only accept a Fox News invitation but received an enthusiastic response.

431,Restrictive Ala. Law Thrusts Abortion Into 2020 Race,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/restrictive-ala-law-thrusts-abortion-into-2020-race/,"A new law enacted this week by Alabama Republicans amounts to a statewide ban on abortion has thrown the matter into the national spotlight and the 2020 presidential race.
The new Alabama law contains no exceptions for rape or incest and allows for prison terms up to 99 years for performing the procedure.
Alabama’s is simply the most stringent of a number of Republican-dominated states enacting or considering new abortion limits.
These state laws, such as the one in Alabama, have risen to national prominence because they are expected to go before the US Supreme Court, and conservatives are convinced that the high court’s new solid right-leaning majority can use one or more to strike down the right to abortion nationally.
“Yes. I mean, this law was clearly designed with an eye towards moving it up through higher courts, getting the Supreme Court to ultimately have to rule on both the constitutionality of what’s in this particular law, as well as access to abortion more generally,” The Washington Post‘s Catherine Rampell said of the new Alabama statute. “And even if the Alabama law itself doesn’t get upheld in its entirety, you could imagine that a number of the justices who have exposed themselves as being amenable to both overturning precedent and rolling back abortion protections, would use it, potentially, as a vehicle to roll back some of those protections.” 
This possibility has attracted the attention of several of the Democrats running for president.
“Well, we have to shine a light on this issue. We have to raise up voices of the women who will be affected by this draconian and inhumane policy,” said candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). “And make no mistake, this is a nationwide attack on women’s reproductive freedom, on their basic civil rights and basic human rights.
“Over 29 states in this year alone are attacking women’s constitutional rights and we have to fight,” she added. “We have to fight now harder than we have ever fought before. So I’m traveling to Georgia tomorrow to talk about the law that has just passed there, to lift those voices up of the women who are deeply affected and to make sure that America understands that this is going to be a fight for something that is so important and personal to every woman, that decision to make these kinds of life or death intimate decisions about our families and our bodies.”
These abortion restrictions generally fly in the face of public opinion. A Washington Post/ABC News poll last year found, for instance, the first surge in Americans saying abortions should be easier–not more difficult–to obtain.
“I think we have an obligation to just think very fundamentally: Does a woman have the right to control her body or do politicians have to dictate to her? Do you know how extreme this is? It says in the cases of rape and incest, that a woman, it is still illegal for a doctor to perform an abortion. So this is outrageous,” said Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, another Democratic presidential hopeful. “It is an assault on human rights, human dignity, freedom to control your body, which has been a fight going on from the founding of this country. And I cannot in any way sit comfortably while this is going on. And this is a time in American history that mandates all of us to stand up and get involved in this fight.”
Yet one other Democrat running for president, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, blames Donald Trump’s effort to pack the Supreme Court with strict conservative nominees for the current situation.
“The Alabama bill comes on the heels of restrictive abortion bills in Georgia and in Ohio. All three bills would ban abortions for most women before they even know that they are pregnant,” Warren said. “No exception for rape. No exception for incest. And in the Alabama bill, doctors could get 99 years in prison for performing abortions. That could be longer than a rapist when he impregnates a woman and she would be forced under that bill to carry that baby to term.
“Republican men are on the march to overturn Roe v. Wade, and with Donald Trump stacking the courts in favor of judges who are opposed to abortion, that could be a real possibility,” she added. “Women across this country are scared. Women are angry. If you support women, now is the time to make that known.”
But perhaps surprisingly, long-time televangelist Pat Robertson–long a conservative and an abortion opponent–believes that the Alabama law may be too extreme, and as a test case at the Supreme Court, could backfire.
“I think Alabama has gone too far. They’ve passed a law that would give a 99-year prison sentence to people who commit abortion? There’s no exception for rape or incest. It’s an extreme law,” said Robertson. “They want to challenge Roe v. Wade, but my humble view is that this is not the case we want to bring to the Supreme Court because I think this one will lose.”

432,Judiciary Chairman Vows To Continue Trump Probes Despite WH Warning,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/judiciary-chairman-vows-to-continue-trump-probes-despite-wh-warning/,"The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee is vowing to press on with the panel’s investigations into Donald Trump, despite a new warning–in writing–by the White House counsel to drop those efforts.
“Today, the White House made the extraordinary demand that the Committee discontinue its inquiry into obstruction of justice, public corruption, and abuses of power, including as set forth in the Mueller Report. We will do no such thing,” committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) said Wednesday. “The White House position appears to be that the Justice Department cannot hold the President accountable, since it purportedly cannot indict him. Now it adds the extreme claim that Congress cannot act either, because that would duplicate the Special Counsel’s work.  This flies in the face of the American idea that no one is above the law, and I reject it. Our investigation into this as well as other troubling conduct by this Administration will continue.”
White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote Nadler a lengthy letter demanding that the committee end its investigation into obstruction of justice, public corruption and abuse of power related to Trump, his administration, associates and business.

“The White House also claims it is willing to cooperate with this Committee while at the same time refusing to work with Congress to produce redacted portions of the Mueller Report, underlying documents and other materials; refusing to provide responses to our requests for information regarding family separation and the decision to not defend the [Affordable Care Act]; and after the President has already declared that he is ‘fighting all the subpoenas,'” Nadler added. “The Committee remains willing to discuss any reasonable accommodations, but accommodation takes two.”

433,A Divided Nation Over Abortion,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/a-divided-nation-over-abortion/,"In a recent interview on Fox News, presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders said, “I believe that the decision over abortion belongs to a woman and her physician, not the federal government, not the state government.”
Abortion may be more common than often understood. Nearly one in four women in the United States (23.7 percent) will have an abortion by age 45, according to a 2017 analysis by Guttmacher Institute researchers Rachel Jones and Jenna Jerman, published in the American Journal of Public Health. By age 20, 4.6 percent of women will have had an abortion, and 19 percent will have done so by age 30.
Abortion can be traced back to the 1840s when it first surfaced as a legal issue, but it wasn’t until the famous Roe v. Wade landmark decision by the Supreme Court that things were “officially” settled. Despite referring to abortion, Roe v. Wade was also used by people to fight for the right to privacy or the ninth amendment reservation of rights to the people.
As Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University College of Law, wrote in a Washington Post article, “After the Supreme Court issued its decision [Roe v. Wade], social movements working on issues unrelated to abortion immediately moved to wield Roe as a weapon.”
Then, the scope Roe v. Wade gradually narrowed and became purely pro-life vs pro-choice, sparking the violent abortion debate. Like many other major political issues, abortion is not only a legal issue but a moral one too. Should the government be allowed to regulated whether or not a woman can receive an abortion? And, is an unborn fetus considered a living human being?
These issues don’t have a black and white answer and require reading between the lines of legal documents.
As Darrel West, author of Divided Politics, Divided Nation: Hyperconflict in the Trump Era puts it, “Abortion is a big part of political polarization because it involves life and death matters. It is hard for either side to understand the perspective of others or to compromise on key moral principals. In that situation, tensions intensify and people start to see opponents as enemies.”
Republicans have been known to call Democrats, “baby killer,” just as how Democrats have claimed that Republicans don’t support women’s rights.
But the lines of pro-life vs. pro-choice haven’t always been so divided and political.  
According to Vox, back in the 1970s, it was normal for Republicans to be pro-choice — and Democrats to be pro-life. Further, abortion wasn’t such a national political issue, nor a major controversy.  Abortion was more of a personal issue, one not represented by one’s political party.
When Richard Nixon ran for president though, he took a pro-choice stance, in order to, “appeal to Catholic voters and other social conservatives.”
Soon after, Ronald Reagan was elected president and promised to nominate Supreme Court judges that would overturn Roe vs. Wade. Gradually, Republicans shifted more and more pro-life, partly in order to please the large (and growing) number of Catholics and garner more votes.

In 1989, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services was argued out on the Supreme Court.  In the end, the court ruled that placing restrictions on abortion was allowed, and, “the state could allocate resources in favor of childbirth over abortion if it so chose.”
As Republicans became pro-lifers, Democrats followed suit and shifted towards pro-choice. As Democrats started supporting LGBTQ+ and women’s rights, they expressed support for, “a […] safe and legal abortion’ and enumerates no limits on that right,” as a right that women should natively have.
According to Wikipedia, “many Democrats believe all women should have the ability to choose to abort without governmental interference.”
On the other hand, Republicans became increasingly opposed to Roe v. Wade and vowed to overturn it.  They also opposed research that involves the destruction of human embryos.
Soon, a partisan line was drawn, and Republican-controlled states started making it harder for people to get abortions, by reducing the number of clinics and delaying the process, while Democratic-controlled states started building more clinics and expediating the process. States were all required to have abortion clinics though, under Roe v. Wade.
Now, sides have been chosen, and one’s stance on abortion is usually linked to one’s party. As with anything in politics these days, the abortion debate has been full of violent and non-violent protests, arguments, or even satirical bills, like the “Man’s Right to Know.”

Others say that dismantling abortion rights has already started — on a state level, like the NYTimes Editorial Board.
In particular, Alabama–under control of a Republican-led state legislature and GOP governor–just passed into law what is seen as perhaps the most stringent abortion law in the nation. It bans all abortions, with no exceptions for rape or incest. Physicians who provide abortions could go to prison for 99 years.
Although the law clearly flies in the face of Roe v Wade, that is the point. Conservatives are so confident of a solid conservative majority on the US Supreme Court, they want to send the high court a law that the court’s conservatives could use to overturn Roe v Wade.

434,Biden: ‘You Will Never Hear Me Speak Ill of Another Democrat’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/biden-you-will-never-hear-me-speak-ill-of-another-democrat/,"Speaking out at a stop on the campaign trail, former vice president Joe Biden pledged not to attack his 20-plus rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination.
“You will never hear me speak ill of another Democratic candidate, and there’s a really simple reason for that,” Biden said. “We have to be in a position, whoever the nominee is, to be able to win. And there’s also a second thing. What will may disappoint you: I’m not going to get down in the mud wrestling with [Donald Trump]. I’m not going to stoop to his level. I’m not going to engage in the name-calling, but I’m just going to — someone said ‘Give him hell, Joe.’ Well, my Grandpa Finnegan used to say, quote Harry Truman, he’d say ‘Harry, give them hell.’ He said, ‘No, I’m not going to give them hell, I’m just going to tell them the truth and let them think it’s hell.'”
Biden also made remarks about what Trump and members of his administration have been doing in response to special counsel Robert Mueller completing his investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 election and potential Trump campaign involvement.

“So there’s a lot going on here. You’re absolutely right. And now they have an investigation of the investigators who were investigating whether or not Vladimir Putin and the Russians engaged in trying to affect our lives. Give me a break, gosh almighty!” Biden exclaimed.
Biden also defended his work as a senator in the early 1990s on the major Crime Bill approved under President Bill Clinton. Today the Crime Bill is often criticized, particularly on the left, for beginning a trend of mass incarceration particularly among African Americans.
“Folks, let’s get something straight. 92 out of every 100 prisoners that are behind bars are in a state prison, not a federal prison. This idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration, it did not generate mass incarceration. … Secondly, the court, I made sure there was a set-up in that law that said there were no more mandatory [minimum sentences], except two that I had to accept. One was that President Clinton wanted three strikes and you’re out, and was part of this entire bill that included the Violence Against Women Act, included the gun control efforts … ” Biden said. “But here’s the deal. What happened is, the mass incarceration occurred by the states setting mandatory sentences. What happened was, if you go back and look, the [Congressional] Black Caucus supported the bill.”
In a separate interview, Biden criticized attempts by Trump and his personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, to dig up dirt on Biden’s son, Hunter, work for a gas company in Ukraine as a “personal attack.”
“It’s hard for me to comment on Rudy Giuliani. I don’t think I will because my Irish may come up. It is a personal attack. I expect that from Rudy Giuliani and the president,” Biden said. “It’s not been one scintilla of evidence that my son ever interfered and I got involved in anything other than doing the job I was supposed to do.”

435,Geraldo Rivera: Attacks Against Tlaib For Holocaust Remarks ‘Extremely Unfair’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/geraldo-rivera-attacks-against-tlaib-for-holocaust-remarks-extremely-unfair/,"While a variety of Democrats are defending Rep. Rashida Tlaib for comments she made about the Holocaust, the Michigan Democrat now also can count another, more unlikely, defender: Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera.
Tlaib, in what Republicans clearly hope becomes a rerun of controversies which have enmeshed fellow Muslim Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), has come under fire for recent remarks on a podcast about “a calming feeling” she gets when thinking of the Holocaust.
Those who are attacking Tlaib clearly are purposefully mischaracterizing what she said.

Rivera jumped to the freshman lawmaker’s defense during an on-air debate with fellow Fox personalities Sean Hannity and Dan Bongino.
“I’d rather talk about Congresswoman Tlaib who has been victimized in a way that is unmistakable. There’s no way you can read her remarks on the calming effect as Dan Bongino has done as being related to her feelings about the Holocaust,” Rivera said. “It’s an obscenity to try to make that argument. He was not suggesting that, you know, the killing of the Jews was something that calmed her. She was saying the fact that the Palastinians suffered so much. The Jews had a home to go to after the destruction of the Nazis. I think it’s very — she said it in an unartful way. I’ve been reading Israeli newspapers and seeing what they’re saying here in the United States. They’re saying that she’s being taken out of context in a grotesque why. You know how I feel about you, Sean and Dan. But you’ve taken a step too far. There’s no way Tlaib was saying the Holocaust calms her.”
What Rep. Tlaib said on that podcast was: “There’s a kind of a calming feeling, I always tell folks, when I think of the Holocaust and the tragedy of the Holocaust, and the fact that it was my ancestors — Palestinians — who lost their land, and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity, their existence, in many ways, had been wiped out,” Tlaib said about at the halfway mark on the nearly hour-long podcast. “I mean, just all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews, post-the Holocaust, post-the tragedy and horrific persecution of Jews across the world at that time.”

436,‘Big Sky’ Governor Latest Democrat With White House In His Eyes,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/big-sky-governor-latest-democrat-with-white-house-in-his-eyes/,"It seems like another day, another Democrat jumps into the presidential race.
This time, it’s Steve Bullock, the 53-year-old governor of Montana, the “Big Sky State.”
Given that Bullock was re-elected to a second term as governor in the same year that Donald Trump won the state overwhelmingly on his way to becoming president, he is basing his nascent campaign for the White House on his ability to cross over to attract and work with Trump supporters.
“As a Democratic governor of a state that Trump won by 20 points, I don’t have the luxury of just talking to people who agree with me. I go all across our state’s 147,000 square miles and look for common ground to get things done,” Bullock said in announcing his campaign. “That’s how I was able to bring Democrats and Republicans together. We need to defeat Donald Trump in 2020 and defeat the corrupt system that lets campaign money drown out the people’s voice. I’m Steve Bullock and I’m running for president.”
Bullock generally is classified as a moderate. While he endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, Bullock declined to attend that year’s Democratic National Convention.
He is pro-choice on abortion. During the 2017 state legislative session, Bullock vetoed two bills aimed at restricting late-term abortions.

Bullock also is for campaign finance regulations, having unsuccessfully attempted to challenge the landmark Citizens United decision before the Supreme Court during his term as state attorney general prior to becoming governor.
And although Bullock believes humans contribute to climate change, Montana became the first state to halt preparations for the Clean Power Plan when the US Supreme Court issued its stay in 2016.
Bullock also issued his own executive order to care for sage grouse rather than allow the bird to fall under the federal Endangered Species Act.

437,Oversight Subcommittee To Address Consequences of Inaction on White Supremacy,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/congress/oversight-subcommittee-to-address-consequences-of-inaction-on-white-supremacy/,"A House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee subcommittee will not only take on the issue of white supremacy but how it manifested under Donald Trump–especially at the deadly clash which took place in 2017 in Charlottesville, Va.
The Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Subcommittee will hold the hearing titled, “Confronting White Supremacy (Part I): The Consequences of Inaction.”
Among several speakers will be Susan Bro, whose daughter, Heather Heyer, was killed as a counterprotester at that “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in August 2017, which brought together various racist and white supremacist groups. Trump’s highly divisive rhetoric has frequently been blamed for a rise in white supremacy and xenophobia.
Not only that but the Trump administration has taken efforts to de-prioritize the combat of white supremacy, according to the subcommittee.
“The hearing will examine the rising threat of extremist violence by white supremacists in the United States, government efforts to combat far-right violent extremism, and the impact on communities frequently targeted by white supremacists,” the subcommittee said in an announcement.

Among several points the subcommittee said are salient to the hearing:
White supremacists continue to pose the most significant threat of domestic terrorism and extremist killings in the United States.  In a May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin entitled, “White Supremacist Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence,”the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) found white supremacists “were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016… more than any other domestic extremist movement.”
According to the Anti-Defamation League, of the 50 domestic extremist murders in 2018, every perpetrator had ties to right-wing extremists, and 78 percent of those were committed by white supremacists.  There were zero killings in 2018 related to left-wing extremism (including anarchists and black nationalists).
The number of reported hate crimes in the U.S. has seen continual growth since 2014.  The FBI reported 7,175 incidents of hate crimes in 2017, a 17 percent increase from 2016, and a 31 percent increase since 2014.  The FBI also reported that in 2017, 4,131 hate crime incidents were based on race or ethnicity.  
The FBI’s official hate crimes statistics are flawed and underreport the actual number of hate crimes being committed.  From 2013 to 2017, the FBI reported 7,500 hate crimes on average while the National Crime Victimization Survey estimated 200,000 hate crimes a year.
Under the Trump administration, DHS appears to have significantly reduced resources and infrastructure that would address the increasing threat of white supremacist extremism. Reportedly, DHS recently disbanded a group of analysts focused on domestic terrorism in the Office of  Intelligence and Analysis, reducing the number of analytic reports on white supremacists.
The hearing is scheduled to get underway Wednesday, May 15, 2 pm ET.
A livestream will be broadcast here.

438,Sen. Lindsey Graham Panned for ‘Situational Ethics’ on Don Jr. Subpoena,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/sen-lindsey-graham-panned-for-situational-ethics-on-don-jr-subpoena/,"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is coming under withering attack for recommending Donald Trump Jr. “plead the Fifth” when the younger Trump is called to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) made waves recently when he authorized a subpoena to bring in Donald Trump’s eldest son for testimony before the committee.
Burr’s subpoena set off a lot anger among his fellow Republicans, and on Monday Graham suggested to reporters that when Trump Jr is sworn in, that he “just show up and plead the Fifth and it’s over with.”
Graham’s advice immediately set off a firestorm, particularly as it set off charges of hypocrisy against the senior senator from South Carolina.
“Whether he has that information or not, suggesting that Donald Trump Jr. is above the law strikes me as unfounded and contrary to the positions that he took on Richard Nixon and on Bill Clinton and others where he has argued that the law applies to everyone and that’s the ruling of the United States Supreme Court,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.)
Graham, however, became a national figure two decades ago, still as a member of the House, he was one of the managers of impeachment against Clinton on the principle that no one–not even the president–is above the law.

Even Chris Cillizza, the non-partisan political analyst for CNN, felt compelled to speak out on-air.
“Lindsey Graham has learned one thing from his newfound ally, Donald Trump. Situational ethics is perfectly fine in politics, because that’s what’s happening here,” Cillizza said. “What’s the difference between [Clinton impeachment] and today, other than 21 years? The difference is, Bill Clinton was president then, a Democrat, and Donald Trump is president now, a Republican who Lindsey Graham has allied himself with.
“There’s a number of issues where Lindsey Graham has just frankly changed positions. Most notably, his attitude about Donald Trump. He famously/infamously called Donald Trump a ‘kook,’ doesn’t know what he’s doing, [would] lead the country down the wrong road, this is when he was running for president in 2016, now suddenly he is one of the president’s staunchest allies,” Cillizza added. “So we shouldn’t be surprised by this, but it is an little bit on the appalling side.”
Online, the hashtag #LindseyGrahamResign reportedly began to trend upward on Twitter, after getting its start with the Democratic Coalition, an anti-Trump super PAC.
The super PAC wrote that Graham “has abdicated his responsibilities as a U.S. Senator and has clearly abandoned his oath to uphold the Constitution and defend the rule of law.”
Reportedly, the hashtag has been used at least 65,000 times.
Burr’s subpoena became all the more noticeable because Republicans have been trying to close the books on the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) calling the Mueller Report “case closed.”

439,"‘The Green New Deal Is Not Just a Resolution,’ It’s ‘a Revolution’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-green-new-deal-is-not-just-a-resolution-its-a-revolution/,"A diverse group of supporters–including the resolution’s prime congressional co-sponsors–came together to rally the public behind the Green New Deal, the expansive plan to address climate change and economic inequality.
“The Green New Deal is not just a resolution. The Green New Deal is a revolution that is taking place in this country. The sun is setting. The sun is setting on the dirty energy of the past. Today marks the dawn of a new era of climate action,” said Sen Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who first introduced the Green New Deal with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). “Look at the sunrise. Are you ready to rise up for that victory that we are going to have? Are you ready to rise up and take on the oil and gas and coal and fossil fuel industry? Are you ready to rise up for wind and solar and clean energy? Will you go out and make this happen for our country? Are you ready for this fight against the strongest political force we have ever seen in our history?”
Although Republicans lately have taken to accusing Democrats of socialism, Markey reminded that it has been the Republicans who have supported government-funded tax breaks for giant oil companies.
“What about the oil and gas industry tax breaks that are a permanent part of the tax code? Some of which have been on the books for over 100 years? Republicans only call it socialism when we try to help the things we like,” Markey said said. “Here’s what I say for wind and solar and all electric vehicles and clean energy, give us some of that socialism that the oil and gas industry has had for a century! Green New Deal.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination and a prominent Green New Deal supporter, also took on the power of the oil companies to fight movement toward more-sustainable energy.

“These companies lied to the American people about the very existence of climate change and committed one of the greatest frauds in the history of our country,” Sanders said. “Just as the tobacco industry was ultimately forced to pay for the fraud they committed, the fossil fuel industry must be forced to do the same.
“We well not allow them to destroy this planet with here is the major questions that the American people must answer. How do we take on an industry with unlimited wealth, power and resources? And here is my answer to that question: We need a political revolution,” Sanders added.
While Sanders and several other Democrats running for president have voiced support for the Green New Deal, it’s level of support in Congress is an open question.
Republicans have strongly opposed the Green New Deal, and when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) tried to bring it up for a vote doomed to fail in an effort to politically embarrass Democrats, Democrats voted “present.”
Further, it’s not clear that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi really much cares for it either.
Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez each addressed the danger that climate change poses to humans and the planet.
“You know, and I know that the scientific community has been very clear. And that is, if we do not act boldly and aggressively to transform our global energy system away from fossil fuel within the next few years, a very short period of time, there will be irreparable harm done to our planet and we are united in saying we will not allow that to happen,” Sanders said to cheers and applause.
“What the scientists are telling us is that if we do not act boldly and dramatically, there will be more rising sea levels, more flooding, more droughts, more extreme weather disturbances, more acidification of the oceans and more declines in crop production,” Sanders added. “You also know that intelligence and defense agencies in the United States and all over the world see climate change as a major national security issue. Because if people cannot grow the crops they need, if people cannot find clean water to drink, there will be massive migrations off people all over the world, which will put increased pressure on limited natural resources and cause international havoc and war.
“Climate change is a global issue. It impacts not only the United States, but China, and Russia, and India, it impacts Latin America, Africa and the entire planet. Let me be very clear. It is absolutely imperative that we have American leadership that does everything possible to bring the nations of the world to gather to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel into energy efficiency and sustainable energies,” Sanders concluded.
Ocasio-Cortez said solutions won’t necessarily be comfortable.
“We cannot and we will not accept anything less than a solution to save ourselves, and that is exactly what this is,” she said of the Green New Deal. “You know, when we talk about the path forward, I wish that as a leader, I could give you comfort about our future. I wish that as a public servant, I could come here and tell you that everything is going to be all right, but I cannot tell you that today because I am not interested in lying to you. But, frankly, there is no reason for us to be comfortable right now.”

440,"Kamala Harris: ‘I’m Going to Win, And I Fully Intend to Win’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/kamala-harris-im-going-to-win-and-i-fully-intend-to-win/,"Despite a strong early launch into the 2020 Democratic presidential contest, most public opinion polls find Sen. Kamala Harris of California has fallen into the middle of a crowded pack of Democratic hopefuls — and well behind either of her two rivals who reasonably claim any frontrunner status, either former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
With just weeks to go until the first debate among the contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination but months before the first votes are cast, Harris maintains an upbeat attitude.
“I’m going to win, and I fully intend to win. I will tell you that the voters in my experience are smarter than a lot of folks give them credit for,” she told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “The voters — and I know this in my experience having one for the offices I’ve run for. When I was the first in every one of those positions, when there was no one like me who had done the job and people would say, ‘Oh, they’re not ready for that. Oh, no one like her has done it before. Oh, it’s not your time. Oh, it’s going to be a lot of hard work.’ And I didn’t listen. As far as I’m concerned, my track record on this issue tells me the voters are smarter than hearing and listening to all that noise. What they want is they want somebody who has a genuine interest in representing them as opposed to self-interest.”
Dealing with the epidemic of gun violence is an issue Harris said would be a priority in her administration. There are many great ideas to address the problem, but what’s lacking is political will, said Harris, who was California state attorney general before becoming a US senator in 2017.

“People have been having good ideas for decades on this issue. What we’re at a loss is people in Congress have the courage to do something. I’m going to tell you on this subject, we’re not waiting for the worst tragedy because we’ve seen the worst of tragedies including what happened this week and seeing the heroism of a child who we now mourn his loss, his parents’ only child. We’re not waiting for tragedies and great ideas. Universal background check? Good idea. You might want to know if someone has been proven to be a danger for themself or others before they can buy a lethal weapon,” Harris said. “Let me tell you what I’m proposing. I’m proposing, one, if by my 100th day in office when elected president of the United States, the United States Congress fails to put a bill on my desk to sign with all of the good ideas or any of the good ideas that I’m prepared to take executive action because that’s what’s needed.”
Harris also reaffirmed her support for single-payer, universal-healthcare Medicare-for-all legislation, including to cover undocumented immigrants.
“I’m opposed to any policy that would deny in our country any human being from access to public safety, public education or public health, period,” she said.
However, just as rival Sanders has in recent weeks, Harris has taken shots to differentiate herself from pack leader Biden.
And, like Sanders, Harris hit Biden for his support in the 1990s to approve the NAFTA North American free trade zone.
“I would not have voted for NAFTA,” Harris said, adding, “I believe we can do a better job to protect American workers.”
She also criticized Biden’s treatment of Anita Hill, when he oversaw her allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas during the hearings for the Thomas nomination to the Supreme Court in 1991.
There is “no question” that Joe Biden’s Senate Judiciary Committee “did not do right by Anita Hill,” Harris said, adding, “He said it himself.”
However, Harris found herself on the defensive for a decade-old California truancy program which ended up jailing the parents of students who skipped school.
“We’re going to get in the weeds, but give me the patience of time to explain it. When I was looking at the issue of truancy, I realized we defined truancy as three or four unexcused absences you’re truant. I was seeing kids missing 80 of 180 days,” Harris said. “What ended up happening is by changing the education code, it referenced the penal code. That was an unintended consequence. If I could do it over again, I would have made sure it would not have increased penalties for the ability to prosecute anywhere in the state to prosecute parents. That was never the intention and it was never anything I did.”

441,Trump and His Political Advisers Take Biden ‘Very Seriously’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-and-his-political-advisers-take-biden-very-seriously/,"Former vice president Joe Biden’s strong start since entering the crowded race for the Democratic presidential nomination has unnerved Donald Trump and his team, according to political observers.
Biden has surged to significant leads in many public opinion polls as front-runner in a pack of more than 20 candidates chasing the nomination to take on Trump next year. More than that, Biden defeats Trump in hypothetical match-ups, according to many of those same polls.
“They take him very seriously. Some of these advisers … they’re actually surprised at how much of a lead he’s opened up,” said Jonathan Swan, political reporter for the Axios news site. “They were always worried about Biden in a general election, but the consensus a few months ago is he can never — has no prayer of getting through this far-left Democratic primary. So there’s a little bit of uneasiness that, wow, maybe he could get through this Democratic primary.”
However, Trump is mistaken to antagonize Biden, according to former New Jersey governor Chris Christie who also ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.

Trump regularly taunts Biden as “Sleepy Joe.”
“I think it’s a mistake for him to be doing what he’s doing. Now, listen, there’s a lot of things that I thought he did mistakenly in 2016. He wound up winning and don’t remind me of that when we get off the air,” Christie said during a TV appearance. “But the point is that I think Joe Biden’s the one guy, and I’ve said this all along, who can go into Michigan and Wisconsin and Ohio and Pennsylvania and appeal to white working class voters.
“The president doesn’t need that type of opponent. He needs an opponent who will repel those white working class voters and keep his” base intact, Christie added.
Meanwhile, there is no evidence that connects Biden to any corruption due to Biden’s son’s involvement in a gas company in Ukraine, said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).
Trump’s team, particularly Trump personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani, has been trying to ensnare Biden in Ukraine corruption in recent weeks as a political tool to take Biden down.
“I don’t know the circumstances in which [Hunter Biden] took the job but I can say this vis-à-vis Joe Biden, there’s no evidence nor has there ever been any evidence that he was doing anything but trying to get the Ukraine government to crack down on corruption,” Schiff said. “Now we’re providing generous support to Ukraine, we’re providing defensive weapons to Ukraine, we want Ukraine to be successful in its conflict with Russia. But part of that is happening in a government that the people of Ukraine are willing to fight for and protect.
“And they’ve had an endemic corruption problem. That’s what Joe Biden was trying to address. So going after his son is just a method of going after someone the president believes is his most formidable opponent,” Schiff added.

“So yes, let the president go after him, but don’t seek the help of a foreign government in your election,” Schiff said of a trip Giuliani intended to take on the matter to Ukraine but cancelled last minute. “And, you know, if this isn’t criminal and Bob Mueller said he could prove all the ailments of a crime, then maybe we need to change the ailments of that crime because we cannot make this the new norm that if you can’t win an election on your own, it’s fine to seek help from a foreign power.”

442,"Toothless Democrats? Watch Out: Nancy Pelosi Has 2,200 Teeth",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/toothless-democrats-watch-out-nancy-pelosi-has-2200-teeth/,"Donald Trump and members his administration continue to ignore subpoenas, flout federal law by refusing to turn over presidential tax returns, decline to appear to testify as ordered, and just appear to go all out to ignore any and all attempts at oversight by the US House of Representatives.
Meanwhile, the House Democratic majority has begun to rachet up consequences for this defiance, as the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William “Bill” Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over to Congress–as subpoenaed–a full, unredacted copy of the Mueller Report and its underlying evidence.
And enforcing Congress’ legal and historical ability to successfully complete its oversight role is critical in a constitutional government set up with checks and balances, according to Democrats and their allies.
“This is a lawless administration. It is denying the American people the information they need by defying all subpoenas. It’s the first administration you’ve ever seen where they say we’ll deny all subpoenas from Congress, whether it’s on the Mueller investigation or on security clearances or in anything else,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). “They defy the law. The law very clearly says that upon requests by the Ways and Means Committee, the IRS should turn over anybody’s taxes. They’re simply ignoring that. So they’re ignoring the law, and they’re stonewalling and hoping that they can get away with it. We cannot have a situation where the president becomes a king or a dictator. I mean, the American people understand that nobody, not — not — not the president, nobody may be above the law. And we have to enforce that.”
But just how do Democrats begin to actually enforce consequences when one of the principal officials held up in this constitutional mess happens to be the chief law enforcement officer of the land, and this officer–the attorney general–seems more interested in protecting the president than in actual, well, law enforcement?

This quandary hasn’t gone unnoticed.
A reporter at her regular press conference last week asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that “as a practical matter,” do the measures that Democrats are trying to implement “have any teeth behind them that will really compel the administration to comply with your request?”
Pelosi began by praising the work of the committees and chairpersons involved — and she suggested perhaps taking matters to court.
“That’s up to the committee chairs to give us their guidance because they have worked so hard on this and they know the territory very well,” Pelosi said. “… So, yes, I do think they have teeth.”
In a separate interview, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) left open the likelihood of jail time, fines and disbarment as consequences for continued defiance of congressional oversight.
“I believe that is ultimately in our future because of the reckless defiance across the board of the Trump administration and former Trump administration officials. Congress is not going to roll over and play dead,” Connolly said. “And we won an election in November, and part of our mandate was to provide checks and balance on an unchecked, unbalanced presidency. And we’re going to do that, whatever is required.”
Lawmakers may not yet be speaking of it, at least publicly, but in the near-term “whatever is required” might ultimately include arrest.
Robert Reich, a prominent member of President Bill Clinton’s Cabinet, recently published an essay advocating arrest of Attorney General Barr should he miss his subpoena as he now has.
Pelosi’s Police Department (and jail, too)
Although no one in this position has been arrested since 1935, it’s actually not too far fetched–certainly if the Trump team continue what amounts to unlawful obstruction of Congress.
Most people don’t realize this, but Nancy Pelosi has her own fully trained, professional police force at her disposal. She need not rely entirely on law enforcement under the executive branch.

Like other federal law enforcement officers, Capitol Police officers first undergo education at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Georgia. After graduating from FLETC, trainees return to the US Capitol Police (USCP) Training Academy in Cheltenham, Md., for additional work before hitting their beat.
If required, Pelosi could potentially use the 2,200-person US Capitol Police to round up and arrest those found to have broken the law.
USCP is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). The department was awarded CALEA’s Gold Standard with Excellence – the highest rating a law enforcement agency can receive during the evaluation process, according to USCP.
USCP is maintained with annual budget of about $450 million.
Pelosi and the House also apparently have the ability on their own to detain individuals, such as those who resist congressional subpoenas.
“I don’t think we’re going to go that far, but courts have upheld that,” Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, was recently quoted by CQ-Roll Call.
Pelosi and other Democrats certainly do not want want to “go there” yet politically when it comes to potentially jailing people on congressional say-so, despite recent speculation and research into an almost ancient jail built into the Capitol building just for this purpose.
“I went to the Architect of the Capitol and found out where the old Capitol jail was located,” long-time Senate counsel Chuck Ludlam said in an interview which was part of a Senate Historical Office’s oral history project. “There was at one time a jail here in the Capitol where the Congress could imprison citizens who refused to comply with its subpoenas.”

443,Tariffs: It’s a Tax ‘Eventually We All Pay in Higher Prices’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/tariffs-its-a-tax-eventually-we-all-pay-in-higher-prices/,"Republican presidents may have, at one time, genuflected at the altar of free trade and tariffs were once anathema. But, for Donald Trump in his trade wars, they have become his weapon of choice.
And he just wielded them once more against China, with what could be surprising and unpleasant effects for their economy–and ours.
Trump actually seems to joke about the jousting he engages in against the world’s second-largest economy.
Trump essentially reduced his fresh round of tariffs to little more than a laugh line at a rally in Florida, where it became scant more than a cheap way for Trump to skewer Mayor Pete Buttigieg, one of the Democrats seeking the opportunity to run against Trump next year.
“We have a young man Boot-edge-edge. Boot-edge-edge. They say edge-edge. He’s got a great chance, he’ll be great. He’ll be great. Representing us against President Xi of China, that will be great. That’ll be great,” Trump said. “I want to be in that room, I want to watch that one. By the way, you see the tariffs we’re doing?”
Yes, Mr. Trump, we do see the tariffs you’re doing. Because, for the rest of us, these tariffs can be as serious as a heart attack.
This latest round involves the Trump administration hiking tariffs on more than $200 billion worth of Chinese products: up from 10 percent to 25 percent.
“And remember, a tariff is essentially a tax,” explained Fox News anchor Shep Smith. “The importer pays that tax and can pass it on to the buyer in America or absorb it. Of course, eventually we all pay in higher prices. But in this trade war, like all others, both sides have shots to fire. Next is China’s move. The question is, will China answer or escalate? China could go light and raise tariffs on American products that are already targets, but might it also tax or even ban, say, U.S. soybeans, which would be crushing for American farmers? Or might China escalate by hitting some of America’s biggest brands, Apple, for example.

“Imagine no iPhones for 1.2 billion Chinese customers and what that might do to the markets and the broader economy,” Smith added. “The next move is China’s, and analysts expect that move will come very soon.”
The pain is much less abstract, and more immediate, for many American businesses, including Kent International, the New Jersey bicycle maker which represents three generations for the family behind the business.
“You know, the business is a tough enough cycle dealing in a very competitive landscape. Whenever there’s a price increase that we have for whether it’s currency or now these tariffs, there’s always a time gap between when we receive these price increases and when we can pass them on to customers. And that means a pretty big hit for us,” said Arnold Kamler, the head of Kent International and whose family history traces back with the company to 1907.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another presidential hopeful, clearly takes issue with the apparently cavalier attitude Trump takes to these tariffs and trade negotiations.
“I don’t believe in tariff negotiation by tweet. I think that we need a comprehensive, coherent plan before we ever get started, and that would start with bringing our allies together so that we have maximum leverage against the Chinese,” she said. “The Chinese are bad actors on trade. That means that our best way to fight back is with strength and with a coherent plan, not with chaos.”
Bicycles aren’t the only American market hard-hit. Ask Democratic Rep. John Garamendi, who represents a variety of California agriculture producers who depend on selling to the Chinese.
“Clearly we’re in the midst of a trade war. I think we’re missing one of the major points at least for the people or the farmers in my district is that they have already lost their markets in China for everything from wine to almonds and beyond,” Garamendi said. “And the earlier round of tariffs by the United States didn’t necessarily result in a tariff on American goods but it resulted in the shutdown of American products being able to be shipped into China. There is a world of hurt. The almond growers in California have already lost well over a billion and a half dollars in their markets as a result of this trade war.”

444,Dem Senator: Breaking up Companies Like Facebook Will ‘Increase Jobs and Prosperity’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/dem-senator-breaking-up-companies-like-facebook-will-increase-jobs-and-prosperity/,"Rather than harm either the US economy or consumers, breaking up social media giant Facebook as its co-founder has suggested would provide important benefits, according to Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn).
Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes published an opinion article which argues the company has now become too unwieldy and intrusive. Hughes left Facebook in 2007.
The company has come under particularly scathing criticism in recent years for the role its ubiquitous platform played in allowing Russian agents to disrupt and meddle in the 2016 election.
Hughes called Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s power “unprecedented and un-American” and said his co-founder’s focus on growth “led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks.”

But breaking up Facebook would bring important gains, said Blumenthal, who sits on the key Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee’s Communications Technology, Innovation, and the Internet subcommittee.
“There is no political risk in protecting consumer privacy. There is only political gain. But that’s not the reason to do it. It’s fundamental to our democracy that consumers be protected against misuse of their data information without their consent,” Blumenthal said. “And there’s only potential approval for consumers in innovation and greater competition which gives them more choice and protection. So, we’re not talking about attacking prosperity or jobs, in fact, increase jobs and prosperity in more competition and really Facebook here is the only company that we’re talking about.”

445,Rep. Tlaib Throws Shade at Dems Not Ready To Impeach: ‘10 Million People Just Told Us: Do Something’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/rep-tlaib-throws-shade-at-dems-not-ready-to-impeach-10-million-people-just-told-us-do-something/,"Some House Democrats are becoming increasingly restless on the issue of impeaching Donald Trump, including an outspoken freshman member who delivered what she called a petition from 10 million Americans calling for Trump’s impeachment.
The demands for impeachment come at an increasingly tumultuous political time in which Trump is ordering members of his administration not to cooperate with congressional subpoenas and he himself has declared executive privilege over the full Mueller Report.
“What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. That speaks volumes. Just alone think about it, 10 million people want us to uphold the United States Constitution,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich). “Ten million people want us to investigate this president and whether or not he has violated the United States Constitution and whether or not he’s acting above the law and I think that is tremendous, you know, movement that is moving — saying to all of us as members of Congress, please, please do something. Take back our democracy. Get back our country. Because for so many of us we’re seeing this becoming a slippery slope and to a president, you know, really does believe that he’s above the law.
“I think any of us, yourself, Erin, or myself doing anything that he’s done, including not divesting in his businesses while he’s president, all of the interactions between the Trump Organization and the Trump administration, we would be under investigation today,” Tlaib told CNN’s Erin Burnett. “We would probably be prosecuted within 24 hours.”
The Trump Organization is Trump’s private business enterprise.

Rep. Al Green, of Texas, is another House Democrat who has advocated for Trump’s impeachment. And, he too, renewed that call after Trump seemed to taunt Green during a Trump rally this week in Florida.
“I’m that man, a liberated Democrat, a liberated Democrat in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm,” said Green, referring to the first African American woman elected to Congress. Like Chrisholm, Green is African American. “I’m unbought and unbossed. Mr. President, you finally encountered at least one person that your money can’t buy and your power doesn’t scare. You have a date with destiny, Mr. President. Your fate is in the hands of 435 members of Congress. You are not above the law. No one is. Impeachment is in the hands of this Congress.
“That man, Mr. President, is a member of this Congress. Mr. President, I assure you that the long arm of the law is reaching out for you,” Green added in a speech on the House floor. “In this country we will not allow you or any other person to hold yourself out as being above the law. You have an appointment with history in this House of Representatives. If no one else will bring you to justice, I will, Mr. President.”

446,Comey: ‘Yes’ It’s Possible Russia Is Controlling Trump,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/crime/comey-yes-its-possible-russia-is-controlling-trump/,"Donald Trump could well be under control of the Russian government, according to the man Trump fired as FBI director months after taking office as president.
While it was up to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation to determine the criminal aspects of potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, the counterintelligence investigation into “whether the Russians had leverage over the president,” said Jim Comey, who served as FBI director from 2013 until 2017.
Asked whether the Russians have that leverage over Trump, Comey replied he didn’t know but “yes” it was possible.
Speaking on CNN, Comey also addressed reports and allegations that in 2016 he ordered “spying” on the Trump campaign.
Comey said that he couldn’t explain why Attorney General William “Bill” Barr calls it “spying.”
“I can’t explain it. The only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it, which is really disappointing,” Comey said. “He knows better than that, and knows that the FBI conducts electronic surveillance by going to federal judges and getting warrants based on probable cause.”
The FBI operation to insert an undercover investigator as a staffer into the Trump campaign was “reasonable” to investigate a specific Trump aide, George Papadopoulos, Comey said.
“That was the guy, Papadopoulos, who was the subject of the information we got from the Australians that he had talked to the Russians,” he said.
That situation is now under investigation by the Justice Department inspector general, but Comey is certain he acted appropriately and within regulations.
“Yes. No doubt in my mind. But that doesn’t mean I’m against review of it. That’s totally fine,” Comey said.
Asked by CNN host Anderson Cooper if the inspector general might find anything inappropriate, Comey replied, “I don’t think so. At least not that I know of. But if they do, they do. And they should be transparent about it.”

Comey did admit to regrets about his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email system as secretary of state, as many observers cite Comey’s last-minute announcement in that affair as sealing Clinton’s fate in the 2016 presidential election.
“If I can go back in time, I would find a way not to be involved at all. But if I don’t have that magic wand, I think I’d likely do it the same way. Here was my problem: I and the FBI needed the American people to trust that this wasn’t a political fix job, that this was done in a credible, fair, independent way. Secretary Clinton had engaged in conduct that was way beyond what the normal carelessness was. So how do we explain to the American people that it’s not the ordinary stuff, but it doesn’t rise to the level that you would be locked up for it? So I have to characterize the behavior in some way, not to attack her, but so that the American people understand this is the basis for their judgment,” Comey said. “It’s not criminal, but it’s not the ordinary stuff. I probably should have said ‘really sloppy’ or something, but I had to characterize it. The goal was to offer transparency to foster trust. I actually think you’ve seen it now.
“We all realize the importance of it now with the Mueller Report. The Mueller Report contains far more detail about individuals who are not charged than we ever even considered offering in the Clinton case, but it’s important for all of us to understand the basis of the decisions being made,” he added.

447,New ICE Program Aims To Pull Local Law Enforcement Further into Deportation,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/new-ice-program-aims-to-pull-local-law-enforcement-further-into-deportation/,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has introduced a new initiative in an attempt to expand local law enforcement participation in its deportation agenda.
The program would task local law enforcement officers to act as arms of ICE by conducting immigration arrests.
According to the announcement, only one jurisdiction in Florida has agreed to join the program thus far, but the agency is actively soliciting other jurisdictions nationwide to join as well.
Announcement of this program likely will further stir debate on the Trump administration’s hardline and punitive immigration policies– particularly among the more than 20 Democrats vying for the nomination to take on Trump next year in the presidential election.

“This program is just the latest scheme by ICE to enlist local police in its abusive deportation agenda. The agency explicitly aims to subvert the will of local communities that have passed ordinances to prevent exactly this kind of cooperation between police and ICE. Participants would be forced to carry the financial burden of ICE’s aggression, potentially costing the state millions in operational expenses and legal fees,” said Lorella Praeli, deputy political director at the American Civil Liberties Union. “ICE and the other agencies complicit in Trump’s deportation force may feel they are above the Constitution — but neither they, nor local police, are exempt from search and seizure laws. With this program, ICE is asking local law enforcement to risk violating the Fourth Amendment. We urge local law enforcement to resist this dangerous proposal and stand by their commitment to the communities they serve.”
Part of the Bill of Rights, the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable search and seizures.

448,Schiff Introduces Constitutional Amendment To Overturn Citizens United,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/schiff-introduces-constitutional-amendment-to-overturn-citizens-united/,"A prominent House Democrat has begun anew, for the first time in nearly five years, the constitutional process to overturn the landmark Citizens United Supreme Court decision.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) introduced a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and increase regulation of campaign contributions and spending. In 2010, the high court’s decision struck down decades of restrictions on corporate campaign spending and allowed corporations to spend unlimited funds to run campaign advertisements.
Schiff’s effort is the first attempt at a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United since a similar effort failed in the Senate in September 2014.
Momentum to overturn the decision has been building since nearly when the court handed it down, according to a timeline assembled by the good government non-profit Public Citizen.

“The Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United overturned decades of legal precedent and has enabled billions in dark money to pour into our elections,” Schiff said. “Amending the Constitution is an extraordinary step, but it is the only way to safeguard our democratic process against the threat of unrestrained and anonymous spending by wealthy individuals and corporations. This amendment will restore power to everyday citizens.”

449,Ossoff: ‘I’ll Take a Look’ at Running for Senate in Georgia,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/ossoff-ill-take-a-look-at-running-for-senate-in-georgia/,"Jon Ossoff, the Georgia Democrat whose surprisingly strong showing in a congressional special election just months after Donald Trump took office, promised supporters that he would at least consider taking on Republican Sen. David Perdue in next year’s election.
Ossoff appeared to come out of nowhere in the spring of 2017, when a suburban Atlanta district opened up after Trump nominated the incumbent, Republican Rep. Tom Price, to join his Cabinet.
Although the seat had long been in GOP hands, Ossoff began to raise huge sums and attract the support of presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Ossoff’s surprising support became a litmus test for anger and disapproval against the new president and his Republican allies in Congress.
Although Ossoff ultimately fell to Republican Karen Handel–51.78 percent to 48.22 percent–it was still an amazing result given that Price had just won re-election a few months earlier with 62 percent of the vote.
Although Georgia has long been considered a safe red state, that appears to be changing as Democrat Stacey Abrams nearly defeated Republican Brian Kemp for governor in 2018.
Abrams, who delivered the Democratic response to Trump’s 2019 State of the Union address, was Democrats’ first hope to take on the freshman Perdue. She passed, however, leaving Ossoff next to consider making a race which may help decide whether Democrats can regain a majority in the Senate.
“As for my future I don’t know, we will see. I’ll take a look at the U.S. Senate race. I want to make sure we have the strongest possible candidate to challenge David Perdue,” Ossoff said to applause. “Whether or not I’m a candidate I’ll work to defeat David Perdue. We need a senator who has the decency to stand up for people who are suffering, who has the skill to deliver the resources that Georgia needs, and who has the integrity to uphold the standards of conduct that we expect from our elected officials.”

Perdue’s cousin is Sonny Perdue, a former Republican Georgia governor currently serving as Trump’s secretary of agriculture.

450,Pelosi: Trump Is ‘Goading Us’ to Impeach Him,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/pelosi-trump-is-goading-us-to-impeach-him/,"Donald Trump is “goading” House Democrats toward impeaching him for political reasons heading toward his re-election campaign, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has thus far worked assiduously to steer her Democratic majority away from Trump impeachment.
“Trump is goading us to impeach him. That’s what he’s doing,” said Pelosi. “Every single day he’s just like taunting, taunting, taunting, because he knows that it would be very divisive in the country but he doesn’t really care. He just wants to solidify his base.”
Trump has told anyone associated with his administration not to cooperate with any subpoenas from the House.
Further, Attorney General William “Bill” Barr failed to appear for testimony as previously arranged before the House Judiciary Committee. Barr is facing being held in contempt of Congress after he failed to meet a deadline to turn over to the committee an unredacted copy of the Mueller Report and underlying evidence. Trump Wednesday cited executive privilege over the entire Mueller Report.

Pelosi said Democrats “cannot accept a second term for Donald Trump.”
“We have to make sure — this will sound political but we have to make sure that the Constitution wins the next presidential election,” Pelosi said. “We can’t be worrying about well, how long is this going to take? Well, that will take as long as it does. And we will press the case so that in the court of public opinion people will know what is — is right. But we cannot accept a second term for Donald Trump if we are going to be faithful to our democracy and to the Constitution of the United States.”
On Saturday, Pelosi’s colleague, Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), said Democrats must impeach Trump to ensure he’s not re-elected. 
“I’m concerned that if we don’t impeach this president, he will get re-elected,” Rep. Green told MSNBC. “If we don’t impeach him, he will say he has been vindicated. … If we allow political expediency to Trump moral imperative, we will have created a shameful situation that this Congress that will never live down, history won’t be kind to us. We must impeach him.”
To date, however, Pelosi has appeared loathe to move forward with the impeachment of Trump because of the political reality that the Republican-dominated Senate is not at all likely to vote to remove Trump from office.

451,Kasich: Do Republicans Care About Russia Interference?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/kasich-do-republicans-care-about-russia-interference/,"After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) went to the Senate floor Tuesday to announce “case closed” on the Mueller investigation, another prominent Republican was asked whether his fellow Republicans care at all about Russian meddling–not only in past elections but the upcoming 2020 election, as well.
McConnell’s “case closed” speech was highly political against Democrats, essentially taking the same line as Donald Trump, that the probe has been nothing but a political hit against the president–and that any further inquiry is illegitimate.
“With everything that’s going on around that, what are they doing in Washington and in Congress to try to stop this from being repeated in the 2020 election? Where is the urgency?” asked Republican John Kasich, a former Ohio governor and congressman who ran for president in 2016.

“And part of the Mueller report, from my understanding, is that it outlines exactly many of the ways in which the Russians” meddle in US elections, Kasich added. “Think about this. The Russians! When I was a kid, we used to hide under the desk thinking we were going to have a nuclear war because of what was happening in Cuba. I mean, the Russians, okay? They are interfering in our election, there is no doubt about that they tried to manipulate us and nobody is doing anything about it. I don’t understand that. It doesn’t make any sense to me.
“Furthermore, Congress also has a right to review what the Mueller report did, and frankly, I hope [Robert] Mueller testifies,” Kasich concluded.
The House Judiciary Committee apparently will have special counsel Robert Mueller to testify as early as next week, perhaps May 15.
However, wrangling over an unredacted version of the Mueller Report is not going well, as Trump has cited executive privilege over the entire report.

452,Booker: ‘I Have No Concern’ That I’m Not in Top 5,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/booker-i-have-no-concern-that-im-not-in-top-5/,"One of more than 20 Democrats running for president, Sen. Cory Booker is struggling in the polls against rivals who are rating higher with voters.
However, the senator from New Jersey said that doesn’t concern him.
“It’s much more about name recognition, and we have seen from John Kerry to Barack Obama,” Booker said, referring to Democrats who ultimately became the party’s presidential nominees in 2004 and 2008, respectively. “This far out the polls did not indicate who ultimately won. What’s important to me is getting out and meeting voters. When I go to Iowa, the response is incredible, people signing up on our campaigns, those Americans who have given contributions to my campaign. We’ve got the fundamentals and foundation.”
In a separate interview, Booker was asked if his campaign is running into trouble because the Democratic Party is moving too far left.

“I actually reject your analysis. Since the time I was a mayor, I’m a pragmatist. I had to achieve things when I was the chief executive of [Newark,] New Jersey’s largest city,” Booker said. “If you look at tweets going back to 2009, my positions then are consistent with my positions now. By the way, things like getting institutional capital into Newark to build the hotel that created hundreds of jobs, now four or five new hotels in Newark, these are things that make a difference for the people in my community.
“The only person in the United States Senate that lives in a lower income, black and brown city, I don’t have time for things that interfere with progress for people right now,” Booker added. “My positions have been consistent about what are the things that make a difference for families struggling.”

453,"Mueller on Track To Testify: Trump Was ‘Blowing Off Steam’ With Tweet, CNN Reports",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/mueller-on-track-to-testify-trump-was-blowing-off-steam-with-tweet-cnn/,"Special counsel Robert Mueller likely will testify later this month before the House Judiciary Committee, a contrary tweet sent Sunday by Donald Trump notwithstanding.
That’s according to CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta.
Although the details hadn’t been nailed down, arrangements were being made for Mueller to testify May 15 before the House Judiciary Committee, when over the weekend, Trump appeared to put the breaks on that. He sent an angry tweet saying that Mueller should not testify.

Lawmakers, particularly House Democrats, have been looking forward to Mueller’s testimony in order to answer questions left unanswered from his two-year investigation into Trump, his 2016 campaign, and any subsequent obstruction of justice.
“According to the source familiar with all this who I spoke with a short while ago, the view inside the White House is that the president was just expressing his opinion when he made that statement and that tweet over the weekend that he’s not necessarily issuing a directive or order to his administration to block Robert Mueller from testifying,” Acosta said. “Essentially with the president saying he views this investigation is over and that it’s time to move on but, interesting there are sources inside administration familiar with this matter essentially saying the president was letting off steam there, not necessarily signaling at this point that he’s going to block the special counsel from testifying.”

454,Judiciary Panel Readies Contempt Against AG as Justice Dept. Tries To Head it Off,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/judiciary-panel-readies-contempt-against-ag-as-justice-dept-tries-to-head-it-off/,"The House Judiciary Committee has readied preparations Wednesday to move forward and officially hold Attorney General William “Bill” Barr in contempt of Congress.
Specifically, Barr would be held in contempt for failing to comply with a committee subpoena demanding that Barr turn over to the panel an unredacted copy of the Mueller Report and all underlying evidence.
Meanwhile, the Justice Department is reportedly attempting to float a compromise that would preempt any attempt to find Barr in contempt over the matter.
Committee members will meet Wednesday morning to debate and vote on a resolution and a supporting report. The contempt report provides an explanation of the committee’s urgent need for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report and underlying evidence, and the history of the committee’s efforts to negotiate with the attorney general, among other details, according to a statement from the committee.
The Justice Department released a redacted version of the Mueller Report last month. Barr also offered limited access to a less-redacted version to a few select lawmakers. But that suggestion was rejected by congressional Democrats.

If the committee and the Justice Department cannot reach a compromise by then, on Wednesday, the Judiciary Committee likely will approve the contempt resolution and send it to the full House for approval.
“Even in redacted form, the Special Counsel’s report offers disturbing evidence and analysis that President Trump engaged in obstruction of justice at the highest levels. Congress must see the full report and underlying evidence to determine how to best move forward with oversight, legislation, and other constitutional responsibilities,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) said in a statement released prior to the latest Justice Department maneuvering. “The Attorney General’s failure to comply with our subpoena, after extensive accommodation efforts, leaves us no choice but to initiate contempt proceedings in order to enforce the subpoena and access the full, unredacted report.
“If the Department presents us with a good faith offer for access to the full report and the underlying evidence, I reserve the right to postpone these proceedings,” Nadler added.

455,Klobuchar: Obama Policies Created Strong Economy,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/klobuchar-obama-policies-created-strong-economy/,"The ongoing strong US economy is the continuing result of President Barack Obama’s policies rather than anything Donald Trump has accomplished, according to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, one of more than 20 Democrats contending for the presidential nomination.
The unemployment rate sat at 3.6 percent, according to data reported last week by the federal government. That figure is the best jobless rate since 1969.
Trump administration officials and allies tried to claim credit, including Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser.
“You’ve got a very strong economy, and again, I will say what you and I talked about President Trump’s policies, tax cuts, deregulation, opening energy, trade reform, stable dollar and so forth, he is rebuilding this economy,” Kudlow said.
Klobuchar, the senior senator from Minnesota, was having none of it.

“I give our workers and our businesses the credit, Jake,” Klobuchar told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “When you’re out there across the country, you see people working harder and harder every day. And this has meant that we are — our businesses are strong, and we’re selling American goods.
“That being said, a lot of people aren’t sharing in this prosperity because of the costs, the cost of college, the cost of health care, the fact that the president had promised that he would bring down the prices of their prescription drugs, and that just hasn’t happened,” Klobuchar added.
“So, when you get out there and you see the energy out there and the concern, talk to farmers who are trying to sell their soybeans. There are people out there that are not sharing in this economic prosperity. And it’s not fair. And it’s not the American way,” she continued. “So, while we attribute a lot of this to our workers and to our businesses, we know we can do better as a country.”
When Tapper asked Klobuchar directly whether Trump deserves credit for the best unemployment in half a century, that’s when she pivoted to Obama’s efforts to dig the nation out of the Great Recession.
“And I remember that the Republicans were giving him grief when he took any credit for that,” Klobuchar said. “So, I think that we have had policies in place, starting with President Obama, that have aided that recovery.
“But what I believe is that we should be governing from opportunity and not chaos,” she added. “And my problem with President Trump, and I think the problem you’re seeing from the citizens of this country when you mention those numbers and what’s happening is, they see chaos every day.

“They wake up in the morning, and they see a mean tweet, or they see some inconsistent policy that causes chaos during the day. They want to have a leader that their kids can look up to,” Klobuchar concluded.

456,Rep. Cohen Suggests Censure for Trump Due to Senate That ‘Lacks Spine’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/rep-cohen-suggests-censure-for-trump-due-to-senate-that-lacks-spine/,"The political calculus which guides top Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi against impeaching Donald Trump usually does so because of the reality that the Republican Senate will not vote to remove him from office.
However, a long time House Democrat has a new idea: censure for the president as a consequence for his alleged crimes, which include obstruction of justice. Further, Trump now has directed anyone involved in his administration not to cooperate with any subpoenas from the Democratic-controlled House.
“As far as the president, if we can’t impeach him, because I don’t think the Senate would [vote to remove] him if he shot the person on Fifth Avenue, we could censure him and a censure in the House which we can do, without the Senate, would at least have us go on record admonishing him for illegal conduct,” said Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.). “The Mueller Report shows there was obstruction of justice. There wasn’t guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but you don’t need preponderance of the evidence for impeachment or censure.

“We need to eventually censure this president and that’s unfortunately the best we can do the best with a Senate that is totally in his control and lacks the spine to uphold the Constitution,” Cohen added.

457,"When Climate Change Initiatives Are ‘Couched’ as ‘21st Century Investments’ Trump More Willing To Listen, Congressman Says",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/when-climate-change-initiatives-are-couched-as-21st-century-investments-trump-more-willing-to-listen-congressman-says/,"Donald Trump has been famously dismissive of the climate change issue, going so far as to call it “a hoax.”
Meanwhile, as congressional Democrats begin to wrangle with Trump over a potential overall national $2 trillion infrastructure improvement initiative, one long-time House Democrat thinks that he may have cracked the secret how to get Trump to accept climate change investments.
“You know, when it’s couched as investment in ’21st century energy and renewables,’ I would say he was somewhat favorable,” said Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, chairman of the House Transportation Committee. “You know, we didn’t talk about climate change per se, but there are ways, you know.”

Trump and Democrats met last week on infrastructure and plan to meet again to move forward in a couple of weeks.
Ironically, Trump appears to be genuinely interested in working with Democrats on an infrastructure plan. However, he is reportedly seeing blowback on his right, from conservatives in Congress, and even in his own White House with opposition from acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have proposed a sweeping plan to address the challenge of climate change, known as the Green New Deal.
Trump and congressional Republicans have been dismissive of the Green New Deal.

458,Trump: ‘Mueller Should Not Testify’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-mueller-should-not-testify/,"Donald Trump appeared to throw another lit match Sunday on his administration’s increasingly combustible relationship with the Democratic-controlled House by signaling that special counsel Robert Mueller should not testify to Congress.
Trump tweeted that “Mueller should not testify.”
….to testify. Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion? There was no crime, except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report), and NO OBSTRUCTION. Bob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2019
“After spending more than $35,000,000 over a two year period, interviewing 500 people, using 18 Trump Hating Angry Democrats & 49 FBI Agents – all culminating in a more than 400-page Report showing NO COLLUSION – why would the Democrats in Congress now need Robert Mueller……. ” Trump tweeted.
“….to testify. Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion? There was no crime, except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report), and NO OBSTRUCTION. Bob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!” the tweet concluded.
If Attorney General William “Bill” Barr takes the Trump tweet as a directive, it could set up yet one more confrontation between the White House and the House.
Barr has been extremely protective of Trump since Mueller first filed his report on March 22 on the subjects of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and subsequent obstruction of justice.

Barr, himself, set up a likely standoff last week with the House Judiciary Committee after he failed to appear to testify as previously arranged.
Further, Trump has ordered anyone in his administration–or once was in the administration–from cooperating with any House subpoenas or requests.
In spite of that–and although nothing had been nailed down–Mueller had been likely on track to testify before the House Judiciary Committee May 15. The White House had previously not intended to stand in the way of that testimony.
Mueller technically is an employee of the Justice Department, and as such, is overseen by Barr.

459,"Lining Up To Defend Barr, Conservatives Promise ‘Pain and Penalty’ for Dems",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/lining-up-to-defend-barr-conservatives-promise-pain-and-penalty-for-dems/,"Conservatives and Republicans in and out of Congress have quickly and fiercely risen to defend embattled Attorney General William “Bill” Barr.
Barr, who has become increasingly controversial since special counsel Robert Mueller submitted his final report in March, ignited a further firestorm this week when he refused to appear as planned before the House Judiciary Committee.
Congressional Democrats–who have accused Barr of lying to Congress in a previous appearance–this week did not disguise their rage against Barr, with some calling for the attorney general to be removed from office.
Republicans, and other allies of the Trump administration, have fiercely defended Barr, who was just sworn in as attorney general only earlier this year.
“The radical Dems of the House and the Senate and the House Judiciary committees somehow believe for some reason that they can get away with more lies, more viciousness, more disregard for law, for basic civility, and so they target the attorney general,” Fox host and Trump ally Lou Dobbs said on-air. “The Dems have made a serious miscalculation. Attempting to intimidate, to coerce, to try to destroy Attorney General Barr will likely result in serious penalty and pain for those radical Dems. Already the truth of the past two and a half years is taking clear shape in the public eye. The lies, the deceit, [and] yes, the treachery of the radical Dems becomes clearer with each passing day.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi owes Barr an apology for saying that he has lied to Congress, said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who has become an avid defender of Donald Trump and his administration.
“The question was about the findings of the Mueller Report and I think his testimony regarding his interaction with Mr. Mueller about the latter, I believe it and I’m going to send a letter to Mr. Mueller asking him if he takes issue with anything that Mr. Mueller said about the phone call they had,” Graham said. “So I just think it’s over the top, I think it says more about her than it does Bill Barr. I don’t believe he lied one bit.”
Moreover, the investigations into Trump, his administration and business activity which House Democrats are continuing do not constitute legitimate oversight–but rather, represent something much more sinister, Graham claimed.

“If they want to go after everything, Trump — if I were Trump — I would fight them simply because I don’t think this is oversight. I think this is trying to destroy him and his family,” Graham said. “Oversight is to hold the executive branch accountable, not to retry the election. Trump won. This is more about destroying Trump than it is trying to oversee the executive branch in my view. Mueller was a different story. He’s a man of the law who’s allowed to do his job. And so if I were to president I would not give into these demands about everything I’ve done because I think they’re politically motivated.”
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-Calif.) defended Barr’s decision to not appear before the House Judiciary Committee over the issue of being questioned by committee attorneys.
McCarthy also questioned the motives of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY).
“Nadler has been wanting to impeach the day after the election. He can’t have the facts to prove of why he should, but he will not stop. This is what the American public is frustrated by: The politics of attacking individuals.
“When you look at the Democratic Party, they now want to weaponize the IRS,” McCarthy added, referring to House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal’s request under a 1924 law to review Trump’s tax returns. “They want to go after — continue to go after the president, and try to go after his family. This has got to stop. The American public wants us to move forward and solve the problems.”

460,Swalwell: ‘We Should Begin Proceedings To Remove the Attorney General’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/swalwell-we-should-begin-proceedings-to-remove-the-attorney-general/,"Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee and one of the more than 20 Democrats running for president, is calling for the removal of Attorney General William “Bill” Barr.
Barr, who has found himself in increasingly hot water over his handling of the Mueller Report, has furthered the controversy surrounding himself by refusing to testify Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee as previously arranged.

“I think we should begin the proceedings to remove the attorney general. He is obstructing in realtime right now,” Swalwell said. “And the only way to fully understand what the president did and to hold him accountable is to see the full Mueller Report and to have an independent attorney general, not one who is acting as the president’s lawyer. And if he’s going to block our access to that information, if he’s going to obstruct, to not turn over information, and even go as far as to lie to Congress then he can’t be in that position.
“And we need to remove him but not take off the table beginning impeachment proceedings against the president as well,” Swalwell added. “But right now the person who is obstructing in realtime from holding the president accountable is William Barr. And I’m calling on my colleagues to join me in beginning proceedings against the attorney general.”
For failing to appear Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee is considering holding Barr in contempt of Congress.
Barr, who only came on the job as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer earlier this year, allegedly lied to Congress during a previous appearance. Barr had been asked if he was aware whether special counsel Robert Mueller had been frustrated with Barr’s handling of the Mueller Report. After that, it became public that Mueller had written Barr a letter expressing just that frustration.
Also, it appears that the four-page summary of the Mueller Report which Barr wrote and released misrepresented the seriousness of the facts Mueller alleged against Donald Trump in the area of obstruction of justice.

“Well, based on his performance to date, I don’t think he’s doing an adequate job. I don’t think he has been honest with the Congress,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.). “And I think we could do a lot better than him. I’d like to see him go. But on the other hand, we’ve had a series of inadequate attorney generals, including Mr. [Matthew] Whitaker, whose improper temporary appointment was a disappointment. So, I’m not sure President Trump is really interested in somebody who is interested in telling the truth and defending the rule of law.”

461,House Oversight Chairmen Seek Compliance from Texas Officials in Voter Suppression Probe,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/house-oversight-chairmen-seek-compliance-from-texas-officials-in-voter-suppression-probe/,"Democratic chairmen from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee this week sent a letter to two Texas state officials following up on the committee’s previous letters seeking documents regarding efforts to purge voter rolls in Texas.
The committee is conducting its own investigation of the voter purge, and the Texas officials–Attorney General Ken Paxton and acting Secretary of State David Whitley — have been less than fully cooperative with the committee’s probe, according to committee leadership.
That’s what prompted this week’s letter to Paxton and Whitley from committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and civil rights and civil liberties subcommittee Chairman Jamie Raskin (D-Md.).
Cummings and Raskin requested the documents on March 28, 2019. Paxton and Whitley responded to the committee with incomplete and inadequate productions, citing an inapplicable state public records law and ongoing litigation to withhold documents from the committee, Oversight leadership said.
The Texas attorney general also wrongly asserted that the gommittee lacks jurisdiction to request documents from state agencies, the committee’s Democratic leaders said.
In their letters this week, the chairmen explain that the committee’s authority derives from the Constitution and is not limited by state public records laws or separate, ongoing litigation.
In contrast with this lack of compliance from Texas, other states have agreed to voluntarily comply with the committee’s voting-related document requests.
“The right to vote is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, and Congress has clear authority under the Constitution to investigate any conduct at any level of government that may infringe on this fundamental right,” the chairmen wrote. “The Committee has a bipartisan history of investigating issues affecting Americans’ right to vote, including the administration of elections by state governments. The Committee also has a long history—under both Republican and Democratic Chairmen—of obtaining documents from state governments as part of its investigations.”

462,First Climate Bill Approved in Decade Would Keep US in Paris Accords,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/first-climate-bill-approved-in-decade-would-keep-us-in-paris-accords/,"The Democratic-controlled House approved the first climate change-related legislation in a decade Thursday, which would keep the United States in the international Paris Accords.
The House voted 231 to 190 for the Climate Action Now Act (H.R. 9), a bill that would prevent the Trump administration from withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement.
“This is about science, science, science. There is an overwhelming number – 86 percent — of Americans know this is a crisis,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said just ahead of the vote, referring climate change. “They know that human behavior has an impact on it and they want us to act.”
The Paris Accords are a United Nations agreement dating to 2016. Its long-term goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels; and to limit the increase to 1.5 °C, since scientists believe this would substantially reduce the risks and effects of climate change.
The agreement, which involves 195 nations worldwide, was signed by President Barack Obama, but after Donald Trump took office, he took steps to remove the United States from the agreement.
If the Climate Action Now Act becomes law, it would overrule Trump’s previous actions on the agreement.
“Democrats said we would honor our commitment to act on the climate crisis. Now we’re delivering. This is the first major piece of climate legislation to pass the House in 10 years and it won’t be the last,” said Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), chairwoman of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, a committee created by Democrats when they took the House majority in January.
“The Paris Climate Agreement carbon pollution reduction goals are vital to the growing clean energy economy and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Instead of cutting and running from this agreement as President Trump proposes, the House voted to honor our commitment,” Castor added. “When America leads on cutting carbon pollution, the world follows, so this is a major signal to our allies that Americans overwhelmingly support this agreement. We deserve clean air, family-sustaining jobs in the growing clean energy industry, and policies that work for the people, not corporate polluters.
“I’m grateful to citizens across America who are speaking loud and clear on climate change. I’m appreciative of my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and my fellow members of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis for their work on this legislation. This is exactly the sort of collaboration we need to address the climate crisis,” Castor concluded. “And I’m thankful for the Republican members who embraced bipartisanship today and voted in favor of this bill. America’s leadership, the health of our families and the health of our planet should not be partisan issues.”
Although this legislation was approved by the House, it faces a highly unlikely future in the Republican Senate, where Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called himself the “Grim Reaper” of Democratic legislation.

463,"Contradicting Past Promises, McConnell Turns Senate into Legislative Graveyard",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/contradicting-past-promises-mcconnell-turns-senate-into-legislative-graveyard/,"Although when Republicans were campaigning in 2014, Sen. Mitch McConnell promised that–if the GOP were given the Senate majority–he would be sure to allow consideration of Democratic legislative proposals.
Fast forward five years, and now-Senate Majority Leader McConnell is bragging about being a “grim reaper” for the legislation–much of it bipartisan–which was approved over in the Democratic-controlled House.
“The American people cannot afford to have Leader McConnell turn one chamber of their government into a legislative graveyard for two full years,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday on the Senate floor.
More than 100 bills passed by the House are awaiting legislative action in the Senate, including:
H.R.1, For the People Act, a sweeping package of pro-democracy reforms that aims to make it easier, not harder, to vote; end the dominance of big money in politics; and ensure that public officials work for the public interest.
H.R.7, Paycheck Fairness Act, legislation to empower women to challenge pay discrimination in the workplace, which passed the House with bipartisan support.
H.R.8, Bipartisan Background Checks Act, legislation to enact the common sense, widely-supported expansion of background checks for gun purchases, which passed the House with bipartisan support.
H.R.1585, Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which passed the House with bipartisan support.
H.R.1644, Save the Internet Act, legislation to restore net neutrality, which passed the House with bipartisan support.
“If I’m still the majority leader of the Senate, think of me as the Grim Reaper. None of that stuff is going to pass. None of it,” McConnell said in remarks last month in his home state of Kentucky, per CNN.
Except that McConnell’s stance violates commitments he offered about how he and Republicans would run the Senate.
McConnell promised that he would open the Senate so that ideas with bipartisan support could come to the floor, and said that he would allow a free and open amendment process to foster bipartisanship and deliver real legislation to the president’s desk. But Leader McConnell has failed to live up to these commitments, according to Senate Democrats.
Instead, he has “filled the amendment tree” – a process that denies senators of both parties the ability to offer amendments – more than all other Republican majority leaders in the history of the Senate combined, Democrats said. Only eight amendments have received floor votes in the current 116th Congress.

However, in remarks made at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in May 2014, McConnell promised otherwise.
“If Republicans were fortunate enough to reclaim the majority in November, I assure you, my friends, all of this would change. A Senate majority under my leadership would break sharply from the practices of the [Majority Leader Harry] Reid era in favor of a far more free-wheeling approach to problem solving. I would work to restore its traditional role as a place where good ideas are generated, debated and voted upon. We’d fire up the committee process. And, by the way, when I say that, I mean Democratic ideas, too,” he said. “[…] I guarantee you these are things that can and will change because one person can change most of the problems in the Senate and that’s whoever the majority leader is, the person who gets to set the agenda has the right of prior recognition and has the opportunity to decide whether you’re going to apply a gag rule to everybody or whether you’re going to use tactics that create a greater level of comity and, of course, get more results.”

464,"Bernie Sanders Slams Biden: I Was Against Bad Trade Deals Like NAFTA, TPP",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/bernie-sanders-slams-biden-i-was-against-bad-trade-deals-like-nafta-tpp/,"In a sign of the slugfest that the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination could become, Sen. Bernie Sanders went after former vice president Joe Biden on the matter of US trade deals during a TV appearance.
Biden and Sanders right now often are ranked as the top two front-runners in a crowded, 20-candidate race for the Democratic nomination.
“Well, look, I’m running against, I think, 19 other people, so I’m concerned about everybody. But I think when people take a look at my record versus vice president Biden’s record, I helped lead the fight against NAFTA,” Sanders said. “He voted for NAFTA. I helped lead the fight against [Permanent National Trade Relations] with China. He voted for it. I strongly opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He supported it. I voted against the war in Iraq. He voted for it.
“So I think what I hope, Anderson, what this campaign is about — and I have to tell you, I like Joe Biden. Joe is a friend of mine,” Sanders added. “But I think what we need to do with all of the candidates, have an issue-oriented campaign, not personal attacks, but talk about what we have done in our political lives, what we want to do as president, and how we’re going to transform our economy so that it works for all of us and not just the 1 Percent.”
NAFTA is the North American trade zone negotiated under the George HW Bush administration and carried forward and approved by Congress with support by the Clinton administration. Permanent Most Favored Trade status improved China’s trade status with the United States toward the end of the Clinton administration. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a Pacific-area trade zone negotiated by the Obama administration but cancelled by the Trump administration.
Sanders also reacted to tweets from Donald Trump encouraging Sanders to become angry with the Democratic National Committee over Trump’s allegation–made without evidence–that the DNC was rigging the nomination against Sanders, and for, Biden.

“I think most of us don’t know what the president is usually talking about, but our response to that Anderson was, yeah, I do feel indignation and anger against a president who told the American people — you remember this — he would provide health care to everybody and yet he worked overtime to try to throw 32 million Americans off of the health care that they have,” Sanders said. “He was a president, a candidate who said he would not cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, then he brings forth a budget with massive cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and cuts to Social Security as well. So our indignation is at a president who lied to the working families of this country when he said he would stand up for them.”

465,Democrats Show No Signs of Bowing to Attorney General Over Threatened Defiance,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/democrats-show-no-signs-of-bowing-to-attorney-general-over-threatened-defiance/,"Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are refusing to give in to Attorney General William Bill Barr’s threat to potentially be a no-show a hearing this week at which he is to be the star witness.
Barr, who has become controversial in recent weeks for his interpretation of the Mueller Report, has threatened not to appear at the hearing because he opposes the format of allowing him to be questioned by committee attorneys.
That position is unacceptable, according to Democrats.
“He is not going to dictate the format of the Judiciary Committee. What we are planning to do is that after the members finish questioning for five minutes, the Democratic Counsel will have half an hour to question and the Republican Counsel will have half an hour to question. That’s a standard method of doing things,” said committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). “Sometimes it’s used, sometimes is not. It’s, in my judgment, an effective way of doing things. And the witness is not going to tell the committee how to conduct its hearing, period.”
Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Tex.), a Judiciary Committee member, noted that Barr’s apparent stance is just in keeping with what has become an across-the-board dictate from Donald Trump to the officials in his administration to not cooperate with any oversight or subpoena.
“Well, let me say I’m not going to–and I don’t think the Judiciary Committee is going to–accept any rejection or refusal by Mr. Barr. If we have to, [the committee will] take this to the highest court in the land. We hope we will not have to do that,” she said. “But let me be clear, he is following the tone and the admonitions set by the president, who wants to create a constitutional crisis. The president wants to lead us down a path that Democrats are trying to be deliberate and thoughtful and to get to the truth.

“The president has now changed his tune on the Mueller Report,” Jackson-Lee added. “He’s castigating Director [Robert Mueller] and he’s saying this report is not truthful. He’s attacking [former White House counsel] Mr. [Don] McGahn. He wants to now pull back on his complimentary words when he thought the American people were buying into his narrative that he had been exonerated. They know he’s not been exonerated. They know he has been associating with Russian operatives, the adversary of the United States.”
Meanwhile, Robert Reich, who served as Labor secretary during the Clinton administration and has been a prominent progressive activist in recent years, penned an essay for Newsweek titled, “Congress Should Be Ready To Arrest Attorney General William Barr if He Defies Subpoena.“
“What could the Committee do? Hold Barr in contempt of Congress—under Congress’s inherent power to get the information it needs to carry out its constitutional duties. Congress cannot function without this power,” Reich explained.
“Under this inherent power, the House can order its own sergeant-at-arms to arrest the offender, subject him to a trial before the full House, and, if judged to be in contempt, jail that person until he appears before the House and brings whatever documentation the House has subpoenaed,” Reich added.
He notes that this actually hasn’t been tried since 1935, and it’s not likely that the American people would be witness to a Barr takedown on live TV, as the Trump administration would undoubtedly take the matter to the Supreme Court on an expedited basis.
And, Reich pointed out, with two Trump appointees on the high court, an outcome is far from assured.
Still, Reich concluded, “Congress has a constitutional duty to respond forcefully, using its own inherent power of contempt.”

466,Chris Christie: Biden Needs To Avoid Being this Cycle’s Jeb Bush,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/chris-christie-biden-needs-to-avoid-being-this-cycles-jeb-bush/,"Former vice president Joe Biden’s “hugest risk” in seeking the Democratic presidential nomination is that his candidacy goes the same way as former Florida governor Jeb Bush’s bid for the GOP nod four years ago, according to former New Jersey governor Chris Christie.
“Joe Biden’s hugest risk is he’s Jeb Bush. His biggest risk is … Well, he’s the guy who comes out as the frontrunner early, he’s the guy with enormous history, he’s got associations like Joe Biden does with Barack Obama and others who lift him,” said Christie, who also ran for the Republican presidential nomination four years ago. “But can he be someone who addresses today’s needs? Jeb, I think, never understood the political times we were in and he never changed and adjusted. Will Joe Biden change and adjust to these times to be able to be someone who … speaks to the concerns of Democratic primary voters now and then, ultimately, general election voters who, remember, did elect Donald Trump three years ago?”
As both the son and brother of former presidents, Bush began the 2016 cycle as the prohibitive front-runner, especially as he raised what appeared to be a formidable $100 million for his presidential political action committee, called Right to Rise.

The 2016 election initially was expected to be an epic battle between two American political dynasties, the Bushes and the Clintons while early on Donald Trump’s candidacy was viewed skeptically.
Trump, however, began to regularly criticize the Bush presidencies generally, and Jeb Bush particularly, as “low energy.”
Bush’s campaign fell apart in the early primary states before Bush pulled the plug after an embarrassing fourth place finish in South Carolina.

467,"In Lieu of Comedy, Correspondents Dinner Opens with Dark Sermon on Trump Endangering Journalists",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/media-press/in-lieu-of-comedy-correspondents-dinner-opens-with-dark-sermon-on-trump-endangering-journalists/,"For the first time in recent memory, the White House Correspondents Dinner did not have a comedian emcee its annual dinner. Instead, the president of the White House Correspondents Association, Olivier Knox, delivered a solemn address to open up the usually jubilant evening. 
Knox focused his remarks on the threat he said the White House is putting journalists under. 
“I don’t want to dwell on the president,” Knox said while discussing President Trump. “This is not his dinner. It’s ours, and it should stay ours. But I do want to say this. In nearly 23 years as a reporter I’ve been physically assaulted by Republicans and Democrats, spat on, shoved, had crap thrown at me. I’ve been told I will never work in Washington again by both major parties.”
“And yet I still separate my career to before February 2017 and what came after,” Know continued. “And February 2017 is when the president called us the enemy of the people. A few days later my son asked me, ‘Is Donald Trump going to put you in prison?” At the end of a family trip to Mexico he mused if the president tried to keep me out of the country, at least Uncle Josh is a good lawyer and will get you home.” 
Journalists in the Trump era are under physical threat, Knox said somberly.

“I’ve had to tell my family not to touch packages on our stoop,” he told the crowd. “My name is on a statement criticizing the president for celebrating a congressman’s criminal assault on a reporter. I’ve had death threats, including one this week. Too many of us have. It shouldn’t need to be said in a room full of people who understand the power of words but fake news and enemies of the people are not punch lines, pet names or presidential. And we should reject politically expedient assaults on the men and women whose hard work makes it possible to hold the powerful to account.”
Watch his full remarks here.

468,Warren: Markets Without Rules Are Theft,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/warren-markets-without-rules-are-theft/,"Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren says that, although she believes in capitalism, it should work for all–not just the rich and powerful.
“Look, I believe in markets. I think we ought to be having markets work. I think that people who want to start small businesses should get a chance to grow them. But markets without rules are theft,” the senator from Massachusetts told an interviewer last week on the sidelines of the She the People presidential candidates’ forum in Houston, Texas. “And these great fortunes we have in America, it’s one tenth of one percent hold this wealth. Right now, this year, you want to talk about fairness, this year, the people in that category are going to pay roughly about 3.4 percent of their total wealth in taxes. Okay. The 99.9 percent of America is going to pay about 7.4 percent of their total wealth in taxes. that’s more than double. Two cents, that’s all I’m asking for, on every dollar of those fortunes above $50 million. And that still means they’re paying less than everybody else.”
Warren, one of 20 Democrats seeking the presidential nomination, also described how she arrived at calling for impeachment of Republican incumbent Donald Trump following the release of the redacted Mueller Report.

“So, look, I never thought that this was going to be where we were going to be in the middle of a presidential race,” Warren said. “I was on an airplane when the Mueller report dropped and I started reading it. And I turned the page, and I read, and I read, and I read, and I read into night, I read into early next morning, and when I got to the end, I knew three things for sure. A hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 electoral system to help Donald Trump, see the footnotes, it’s all in there. Part 2, Donald Trump welcomed that help. It’s appalling, but it’s all in there. And part three, when the federal government tried to investigate part 1 and part 2, he took actions, he tried everything that he could to derail, stop, move, distract, in other words, to shut down that investigation.
“We’re not a dictatorship where the government all rallies around the dictator. We’re a constitutional democracy,” Warren added. “And that means no one is above the law. And that includes the president of the United States.”
Despite Warren’s position, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her team has not shown any interest in moving quickly toward impeachment.

469,Trump Thrills NRA Members with Surprise Decision To Pull U.S. from Global Gun Treaty,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-thrills-nra-members-with-surprise-decision-to-pull-u-s-from-global-gun-treaty/,"Donald Trump, in an appearance this week before a most-appreciative crowd, signed a document which removed the United States as a signatory of a global gun treaty.
Trump, as he is gearing up for his bid for re-election, appeared before a crowd of supporters of the National Rifle Association, or NRA.
NRA support played an important role in Trump’s first run, in 2016, which landed him in the White House.
Specifically, Friday in Indianapolis, Trump signed a document related to the UN Arms Trade Treaty.
“As part of this decision, I will sign right now, in front of a lot of witnesses, a lot — there are a lot of witnesses — a message asking the Senate to discontinue the treaty ratification process and to return the now rejected treaty right back to me in the Oval Office where I will dispose of it,” Trump said to cheers and applause. “By taking these actions, we are reaffirming that American liberty is sacred and that American citizens live by American laws, not the laws of foreign countries. Thank you.”

Trump’s action on the treaty was largely symbolic. While President Barack Obama signed the treaty in 2013, he never sent it to the US Senate for ratification, so it was never in force from a US point-of-view.
Moreover, there is an historical US legal principle that international treaties cannot supercede US laws or the Constitution.

470,Kerry Concerned About Size of Dem Primary Field: ‘I Don’t Think This Is Helpful’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/kerry-concerned-about-size-of-dem-primary-field-i-dont-think-this-is-helpful/,"The extraordinary size of the 2020 field of Democratic presidential hopefuls isn’t necessarily good news, according to a man who would know.
Former vice president Joe Biden this week joined the field of contenders for the Democratic nomination, bringing its size to 20. It’s the largest Democratic presidential nomination field. The winner will face off against incumbent Donald Trump.
“Well, Joe is qualified and obviously should be running,” said John Kerry, former secretary of state who also was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004.
At the time a US senator from Massachusetts, Kerry emerged as the nominee by defeating a field of rivals less than half the size of this year’s crop of Democratic contenders. Kerry went on to lose narrowly to Republican President George W Bush.

“I don’t want to get into commentary on everybody [running today], but I don’t think this is helpful for the Democratic Party, I don’t think it’s particularly helpful for the country,” Kerry added, referring to the large size of the field.
“I think it’s helpful to have a healthy primary, but as many candidates as we have today, I think it’s complicated for voters and complicated for the raising of money in particular,” Kerry said.

471,Harris: Young Black Men Jailed for Selling Pot Should Be ‘First in Line For Legal Weed Jobs’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/harris-young-black-men-jailed-for-selling-pot-should-be-first-in-line-for-legal-weed-jobs/,"African American men who have been imprisoned for selling marijuana should now be the first to be employed in the burgeoning legal-marijuana industry as the drug fast becomes decriminalized nationwide, according to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).
“And the very young men who were trying to make money doing the same thing but got criminalized and have now been branded felons for life are excluded from the economic opportunities that are now available because of this new industry,” Harris, one of several of the Democrats running for the nomination for president, this week told those gathered at She The People.
Held in Houston, Texas, She The People was an event for Democrats running for president to tell women of color why they should earn their vote.
“So part of what has to happen is there have to be policies in place that look at the background and actually do the work of saying that some of those young men should be first in line to get the jobs that are available,” Harris said to cheers and applause. “And that their felony convictions should not be the barrier to them having employment in an industry that they were a part of before it was an industry.”

Harris added, to laughter, “They were ahead of the curve.”
Before she entered the US Senate in 2017, Harris was attorney general for the state of California.

472,Biden Begins To Meet Challenges on Road to White House,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/biden-begins-to-meet-challenges-on-road-to-white-house/,"Now, finally, an official candidate, former vice president Joe Biden began to face advice, criticism and potential trouble as he navigates his way toward the Democratic presidential nomination.
Biden kicked off his campaign Thursday, with a well-received video on social media.
“America is coming back like we used to be. Ethical, straight, telling the truth, supporting our allies. All of those good things,” Biden told reporters Thursday.
Biden begins his campaign, according to public opinion polling, both as an early front-runner for the Democratic nomination, as well as the winner of a hypothetical matchup against incumbent, Republican Donald Trump.
One of the very first questions Biden had to face is why his friend, and former boss, President Barack Obama hasn’t endorsed Biden.
“I asked President Obama not to endorse me,” Biden said. “Whoever wins this nomination should win it on their own merits.”
Other Democrats explained that that perception that if he wins the nomination, that Biden did so on his own would be important for Democratic unity after the nominating process. The idea is to neutralize any acrimony which existed in 2016 after it became apparent that the Democratic National Committee gamed the system in favor of ultimate nominee Hillary Clinton and against challenger Bernie Sanders.

Although Obama himself isn’t involved, now that he has announced Biden simultaneously will be just another candidate subject to political dynamics but also tied to a lot of Obama nostalgia, said Jen Palmieri, who worked in the Obama administration before joining the Clinton campaign in 2016.
“And I know that what the Biden team is worried about are these high expectations, and being the front runner particularly in the Democratic primary, the front runner doesn’t normally win, because the front runner is coming in usually artificially inflated,” she said. “There’s a lot of Obama nostalgia that’s behind this candidacy. Maybe this is a time that that works. That has never worked in the Democratic primary before.”
Another Obama veteran, former strategist David Axelrod, also offered advice: particularly to avoid getting drawn back to refight any of the battles Biden found himself in during his decades in Washington as a senator before becoming vice president.
“My advice would be to get to where we are today very, very quickly. As long as he’s living in the past, it’s going to be problematical for him,” Axelrod said. “So he needs to articulate where he would lead the country in the future and the values that he believes in and not get into sort of an apology tour for every vote he’s ever cast. And that’s going to be difficult.
“Look, his experience is a strength. It gives people some confidence that he can restore some ballast to Washington, but on the other hand, 45 years of comments and votes are a burden he will have to carry into this,” Alexrod added. “And if he gets caught in a perpetual cycle of explaining and apologizing, that’s going to be a problem for him going on — going forward.”
To that end, the nascent Biden campaign clearly wants to put a lid on a potentially nearly 30-year-old hornet’s nest: Biden’s leadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee and his treatment of Anita Hill as she accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment.
Asked about it on-air, all a Biden spokeswoman would say was, “So, I’m not going to get into their private discussions, but they have spoken.”
The on-air journalist tried to pin down the spokeswoman further but she returned to variations of the original statement.
Biden will face a unique position as a former vice president on stage when it comes time for debates among the Democratic contenders for the nomination, said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist and currently CNN commentator.

“There’s going to be little bit of a stature gap, right, just naturally as a former vice president. How are you, as the other candidates, going to handle that and his level of experience? But also does he recognize he’s going to be accountable both for the unfinished business of the Obama presidency, as well as his own record from his time in the Senate?” Finney asked, rhetorically.
Despite the potential pitfalls that he faces, and the fact that Trump has has already tagged him with the nasty nickname “Sleepy Joe,” it seems like Biden is the opponent which frightens the Trump team the most.
“By all accounts, this is the candidate that they fear most because of his strength in places like Pennsylvania, which of course, he’s going to go to, places like Pittsburgh, places like Philadelphia,” said CNN political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson. “That was the key to Donald Trump’s success.”
Also, former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich admitted that, if Trump runs a poor campaign or the nation’s economy falters, that Biden “conceivably” could beat Trump on Election Day, 2020.

473,Trump on Drug Detection: ‘Dogs Do a Better Job than $400 Million Worth of Equipment’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-on-drug-detection-dogs-do-a-better-job-than-400-million-worth-of-equipment/,"Donald Trump apparently decided to court a new voting bloc Wednesday: dog lovers.
In keynote remarks at the Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit in Atlanta, Ga., Trump extolled the virtues of drug-detecting canines.
“This year we’re probably ahead of schedule a little bit. That’ll have a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country. And we have many other things, including the finest equipment that you can buy, hundreds of millions of dollars of the best drug detection equipment you can have. And I always say this, because as good as that equipment is, and it’s genius, the greatest equipment in the world is a dog,” Trump said. “Dogs — a certain type of German shepherd in particular — dogs do a better job than $400 million worth of equipment. Can you believe that? Only the dog lovers would understand that, right?” Trump added, to audience applause and cheers.

“No, it’s true. I said to the Border Patrol the other day, they were giving me a little bit of a rundown on the equipment, you know, it’s close to $500 million worth of equipment at the ports of entry. I said, ‘How does this compare to those great dogs I saw?’ They say, ‘Sir, honestly, the dogs are better.’ I said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding.’ It’s incredible. They showed me and it’s actually incredible,” Trump continued. “But we also have a lot of dogs and they’re great dogs and we cherish them.”

474,Joe Biden Changes The Whole Race,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/joe-biden-changes-the-whole-race/,"After months of teasing–and weathering what has amounted to a relatively minor scandal over a few women “uncomfortable” with his tactile expressions–former vice president Joe Biden has jumped into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Biden announced Thursday with a video on social media:



This is Biden’s third run for president. Opinion polls have had Biden leading a large Democratic field, even before his official entry. Polls, including a Fox News poll from last month, has Biden decisively defeating Trump in a hypothetical head-to-head general election contest.
Furthermore, reaction to Biden’s decision to run was largely positive.
“When American voters go to the polls in February of next year, the first caucus, no one is going to be thinking about a rollout. They’re going to be thinking about what the person has done in their career, the level of experience, the qualities they have, and the campaign that they’ve run,” said Ed Rendell, a former governor of Pennsylvania and ex-chairman of the Democratic National Committee. “So, I don’t think, I’m not on the inside, I don’t know what the strategy was, but I do know that Joe Biden is going to run a good campaign, he’s got great credentials and the American people know he is a decent, honorable man in contrast to the president.”
Biden is appreciated for his integrity and empathy, according to Jay Carney, who worked as the vice president’s director of communications before going on as White House press secretary during the Obama administration.

“Well, he’s Joe Biden, and that comes with a lot of, you know, positive I think momentum for him,” Carney said. “He’s recognized and appreciated he’s not a divisive figure within the party. He’s a serious person with high integrity. He also has enormous empathy. I think [others were] talking about … the empathy deficit we’re seeing in our country, and Joe Biden has empathy that is borne out of his own personal experience. There are very few people I know who have suffered in life as much as he has, and yet he wakes up every morning thinking about other people, thinking about how to make their lives better and, you know, with great concern for the, you know, the fate of people who have less than he does. And that’s what you want in a leader.
“And I think those advantages outweigh issues around [being of an older] generation,” Carney added. “After all, he’s not even the oldest Democrat in the race. So I think that he’ll be fine on those issues.”
Even Republican John Kasich, the former Ohio governor who ran for president in 2016, offered Biden high praise.
“Joe Biden is the Secretariat of this horse race,” Kasich said, referring to the Triple Crown winner which is regarded as one of the greatest race horses of all time.
But Kasich added, “Now, so, here is this thing, even Secretariat can stumble. And you know, Biden — he talks a lot. I talk a lot. I mean, when do you that, you’re authentic. And sometimes you make mistakes. But you can’t pay that much attention to Twitter World when it comes to the general thrust. But he changes the whole race.”

475,"Gov. Larry Hogan Rips RNC, Compares Trump to a Dictator",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/gov-larry-hogan-rips-rnc-compares-trump-to-a-dictator/,"Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, who is considering a challenge to Donald Trump for the GOP presidential nomination, slammed the Republican National Committee for an unusual resolution it approved earlier this year in which the RNC gave Trump its undivided support for the 2020 election.
“I was pretty critical of that,” Hogan said during an appearance in the early presidential primary state of New Hampshire. “You know, and not that the Republican National Committee doesn’t have the right to support a sitting president, but to change the rules and to insist on 100 percent loyalty to the dear leader, it just didn’t sound — it didn’t sound very much like the Republican Party that I grew up in, working for Ronald Reagan and supporting, you know, George Bush and — you know, I’m — I’m for a return to a more traditional Republican Party.”

Hogan was the first Republican in 50 years to win a second term as Maryland governor in the 2018 election. He works with a predominantly Democratic legislature and has kept Trump at arm’s length since Trump took office.
Former Massachusetts governor William Weld has jumped into the GOP primary race against Trump.
Any Republican challengers will have a tough road ahead, as opinion polling typically puts Trump’s approval among Republicans approaching 90 percent. Also, Trump raised $30 million for his campaign in the most recent quarter.

476,Pelosi: Democrats May Have ‘No Choice’ But Impeachment,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/pelosi-democrats-may-have-no-choice-but-impeachment/,"After months of dismissing the idea of impeaching Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi just this week acknowledged the possibility that it could be inevitable after the release of the redacted Mueller Report.
It wasn’t that long ago that Pelosi appeared to put a lid on any effort to impeach Trump by saying that he wasn’t “worth it.” Pelosi has been particularly averse to impeachment realizing that the Republican Senate is not likely to vote to remove Trump from office.
That was before the release of the 400-plus page report submitted by special counsel Robert Mueller which lays out specific and compelling information that Trump attempted to obstruct justice.
Pressure to impeach has begun to build since a redacted Mueller Report was made public last week. However, impeachment is a very divisive process, Pelosi emphasized.
“Well, I do believe that all of us in public office, and especially with any additional responsibilities, have a duty to the American people to keep us together. Our Founders, for all the good things they gave us, gave us guidance, ‘E pluribus unum’ from many, one,” she said. “They couldn’t imagine how many we would be, or how different we would be from each other, but they knew that we had to strive for oneness. I do believe that impeachment is one of the most divisive forces, paths that we could go down to in our country, but it’s the path that fact-finding takes us there, we have no choice. But we’re not there yet.
“And as I said, I said in my [dear colleague] letter, I said to my members, I say to you, as I said earlier, the many ways to hold the president accountable, the Congress,
the Justice Department, they have not decided to use its full power to impeach, to indict. Congress will not be silent in terms of using our constitutional power to find the facts for the American people.”

477,Conservatives Angry at Liberal Internet Bias: Time To Bring Back the Fairness Doctrine?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/conservatives-angry-at-liberal-internet-bias-time-to-bring-back-the-fairness-doctrine/,"Donald Trump and other Republicans have been complaining for some time about a supposed liberal bias wired into the systems behind the Internet.
They complain of bias in how Google returns liberal versus conservative search results. And they criticize how social media treat conservatives.
Tech executives deny their software and algorithms handicap conservative content, although they are under no legal obligation to do so.
Even if online systems were to treat conservative content differently, there would be nothing inherently wrong or illegal if they did.

There is no federal law, or any regulations, which compel any media companies to treat left and right equally.
Ironic, because there used to be, and that policy–known as the Fairness Doctrine–was knocked down by conservatives under President Ronald Reagan.
Put in place by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1949, it told broadcasters to present controversial subjects in an honest, balanced and equitable way.
However, an FCC stacked with a conservative majority appointed by Reagan chose to eliminate the policy in 1987.
Knocking down the Fairness Doctrine paved the way the rise of Rush Limbaugh and the rest of the right-wing chatter on talk radio.
The repeal of the Fairness Doctrine undoubtedly also led to the creation of a Republican-centric Fox News. The Fairness Doctrine only ever directly applied to over-the-air broadcasters. But that’s only because cable TV hadn’t yet matured by the time the policy was killed–and of course, the commercial Internet hadn’t even come into being yet.

If, instead of being repealed, the Fairness Doctrine had continued to be supported by the FCC and Congress it is likely that it would have been updated, from time to time, to cover additional new technologies beyond broadcast.
If Republicans were sincere about their complaints about bias on the Internet, they would dust off the Fairness Doctrine, and work with Democrats to update it for modern technology and reinstitute it.
Given that would probably mean the end of Fox News as we know it, Republicans probably will just continue complaining and screeching about “fake news.”

478,Schumer Plans To Plug Loophole After Restaurant Leaves Workers ‘High and Dry’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/schumer-plans-to-plug-loophole-after-restaurant-leaves-workers-high-and-dry/,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is planning new legislation to plug a loophole in a federal law which a long-ailing restaurant chain took advantage of recently when it gave nearly no warning for layoffs across the Northwest.
Schumer’s home state of New York was particularly hard-hit when the Friendly Restaurant chain, headquartered in Wilbraham, Mass., shuttered a number of it’s locations, including 15 in Upstate New York “without so much as a day’s notice,” according to a statement from the Democratic senator’s office.
“The way by which Friendly’s left their workers across Upstate high-and-dry isn’t just something we should lament, it’s something we should address – by closing the Friendly’s loophole that allowed this company to fire scores of valuable employees without a moment’s notice. If these women and men worked in a factory, they would have received a WARN notice, but—even though they had the very same employer—because they happened to work at different locations the company was not required to give any notice, and that’s just wrong,” said Senator Schumer. “So, in the spirit of fairness, and so this doesn’t happen again, I am announcing plans to introduce new legislation to close this gaping loophole, because we shouldn’t have hundreds of hardworking employees show up for work in the morning only to be told to close up shop—for good. The truth is: this issue is not just about Friendly’s. It’s about fairness and amounts to an acknowledgment corporations need to adhere to and embrace much friendlier worker protections.”
Schumer explained that the hardworking service employees from the Friendly’s Corporation deserved better, and argued that more must be done at the federal level to prevent similar mass layoffs from being sprung on workers overnight in the future. Therefore, Schumer announced his plans to introduce new legislation in the Senate that will strengthen the WARN Act by closing the “single employment site” loophole and consequently increase the circumstances under which employers must give two months’ notice to their employees of imminent and large-scale layoffs. Schumer said that this sort of mass layoff shouldn’t happen to workers without fair notice and urged his colleagues to pass his WARN Act-strengthening legislation immediately upon its introduction.
According to reports, over the weekend of April 6-7 the Friendly’s Corp. abruptly and permanently shuttered 23 Friendly’s restaurants across the Northeastern United States.
Established by two brothers in 1935 in Springfield, Mass., with one shop Friendly’s took off as a regional chain serving ice cream and diner-style fare. Eventually bought by the Hershey Corp., it grew to a chain stretching the length of the East Coast. The company has increasingly struggled over the last 20 years since going public.
In 1988 Congress passed the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act to protect the rights of workers and employees in the United States. The WARN Act mandates that employers give their employees 60 days advance notice of large-scale layoffs under certain circumstances. First, only organizations with 100 employees or more are required to comply with the WARN Act. Second, WARN Act notification is only necessary when 50 or more employees at a single employment site are set to be terminated, or if 50 or more employees are impacted by a factory closing.
Schumer said that since each of the Friendly’s locations didn’t cross the 50 employee threshold at any one employment site, the corporation was not mandated to give employees the two months’ advance notice. Schumer noted that by spreading out layoffs across multiple sites throughout the state, Friendly’s was able to skirt its WARN Act obligations and avoid notifying employees ahead of time. Schumer stated that while Friendly’s might not have violated the current WARN Act requirements, the company didn’t adhere to the spirit of the WARN Act. Schumer pointed to Friendly’s maneuvering as having exposed a major loophole in the WARN Act that must be closed immediately.
Therefore, Schumer announced that in short order, he would be introducing legislation in the Senate to close this loophole. Specifically, Schumer explained, his legislation would close the WARN act loophole by adjusting the applicability of the single site requirements that allowed Friendly’s to abruptly lay off hundreds of workers.

479,Weld: ‘I Would Be Ashamed if I Didn’t Run’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/weld-i-would-be-ashamed-if-i-didnt-run/,"William Weld, a former two-term governor of Massachusetts, will be challenging Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.
Weld, who served as governor from 1991 through 1997, officially jumped into the presidential contest this month after considering making the race for several months.
“I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we’ve had out of the White House the last two years, that would be a political tragedy and I would fear for the Republic,” said Weld. “So I would be ashamed of myself if I didn’t raise my hand and run.”
Weld developed a reputation as a socially liberal, economically conservative Republican.
He left the governorship after his nomination by President Bill Clinton to be ambassador to Mexico was torpedoed by conservative Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina. Weld ultimately left the Bay State and moved to New York to consider a run for governor in that state.
More recently, Weld left the Republican Party briefly in 2016 to serve as the vice presidential nominee from the Libertarian Party before offering a last-minute on-air endorsement of Democrat Hillary Clinton for president during an appearance on MSNBC host Rachel Maddow’s program.

Weld has a number of disagreements with Trump, both in domestic and foreign policy.
“I cut taxes 21 times when I was governor, but the difference is I cut spending before I cut taxes, and the president has not done that. So I don’t think it’s fair to say that he’s an economic conservative,” Weld said. “He certainly is an isolationist to a fault. He wants us to despise people from every other country and frighten the American public into thinking that they’re under siege from people in every other nation. That he calls being a nationalist. It really just means — to him it’s more important that we hate everybody else than it is that we love our own country.
“I declared my candidacy yesterday, April 15th, which is Patriots’ Day in Boston because — you know, I think being a patriot means you love your country and you love your country’s people,” Weld added. “And that’s clearly not true of Mr. Trump. He wants to divide his country’s people, ask: What’s the matter with white nationalism? It’s just the opposite of what we should expect from person in the Oval Office.”
In addition, Trump’s views on climate change are irresponsible, according to Weld.
“What you sometimes hear people say is, ‘I like the president’s tax cuts,’ and so do I, by the way, ‘but I don’t like his style.’ But it’s not style. When you’re as angry all the time and uncurious as this president is, it goes beyond style. It goes to policy and substance and I think he comes out in the wrong place.
“For example, the president insists that global warming is a hoax. But does he think those scientists who did those measurements are making money off the deal and lying about the results of the scientific examination? It just betrays a lag of homework and not really thinking ahead about what to do. You know, we’re going to have the white mountains with no snow. The oceans are going to rise. We’re going to have all our sea coast rearranged when that polar ice cap melts if nobody does anything about this. So I think to say, ‘It’s a hoax,’ and therefore it’s an excuse to doing nothing, I think that is utterly irresponsible. It’s not style, it’s substance.”
Weld, however, has his work cut out for him. Trump’s approval approaches 90 percent approval among Republicans, and Trump collected $30 million for his campaign during the most recent quarter.

480,‘If You Don’t Impeach — I Don’t Get What This Is For’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/if-you-dont-impeach-i-dont-get-what-this-is-for/,"Despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the past repeatedly taking impeachment off the table–most notably telling reporters at one point that Donald Trump just wasn’t “worth” impeachment–Democrats increasingly seem to think that the conclusions in the Mueller Report make Trump’s inauguration all but inevitable.
Up until now, Pelosi and some other Democrats have resisted talk of impeachment as a politically “no-win” situation. Although Democrats likely could approve articles of impeachment in the House, chances are that Republicans in the Senate would not vote to remove Trump from office.
Although that political calculus likely remains the same, the evidence presented in last week’s release of a redacted Mueller Report is overwhelming that Trump attempted to obstruct justice multiple times.
Democrats seem to think that evidence forces their hand and makes impeachment a nearly foregone conclusion.

“Now the public has this long report before it. And I think Mueller bet on the public. He bet on the faith of the public that they will read this report. They will look at it. They will look through these devastating details about what the president has done and the president has gotten away with a lot of stuff for the last two years from Charlottesville to taxes to trade and lying and all that,” said attorney Neal Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general during the Obama administration and helped draft the rules which guide the work of special counsels like Robert Mueller. “Here you have people, witnesses, including the president’s staunch allies like his White House counsel, Don McGahn implicating the president in the commission of crimes. It will be much harder for him to dismiss. I think there is only one course of action for the Congress to take ultimately, and it is going to be to impeach this president.”
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, also seems ready to move forward with impeachment.
“The fact of the matter is, I think that when you look at this report, you can see that there is enough information there not only on obstruction of justice but also on collusion or conspiracy, whatever you want to call it, to move forward with impeachment on this president,” she said.
However, there is but one member of the House aside from Pelosi who carries more weight, and that is House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), as impeachment necessarily would originate in his committee.
Asked about impeachment by a reporter, Nadler called it “one possibility.”
“There are others,” he added. “We obviously have to get to the bottom of what happened and take whatever action seems necessary at that time. It’s too early to reach those conclusions. It’s one reason we wanted the Mueller Report. We still want the Mueller Report in its entirety, and we want other evidence, too.”

482,"As Impeachment Once Again Swirls, Dems Plan To Talk Post-Mueller on Monday",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/as-impeachment-once-again-swirls-dems-plan-to-talk-post-mueller-on-monday/,"Lawmakers continued to react to the 400-plus page Mueller Report a day after the Justice Department made public a partially redacted version of the document.
While Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s probably garnered the most public attention with her Good Friday announcement on Twitter that she supports the start of impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump for the offenses special counsel Robert Mueller cataloged in his report, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continued her more go-it-slow approach to Trump’s alleged transgressions.
Special counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up in March his two-year probe into potential conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign in 2016, as well as subsequent obstruction of justice.
Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is one of a field of approximately 20 seeking the nomination to take on Trump next year declared: “Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: ‘Congress has authority to prohibit a President’s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.’ The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment.”

Impeachment, however, would necessarily begin in the House, and Nancy Pelosi has been noticably averse to impeachment even before her Democrats took the House majority and that hasn’t changed since she was elevated once again in January to become speaker.
Her office only released a “Dear Democratic Colleague” letter about next steps post-Mueller, saying only that House Democrats would discuss the issue the Monday immediately following the Easter holiday.
“Today, Attorney General [William] Barr presented a disrespectfully late and selectively redacted version of Special Counsel Mueller’s report,” the letter began.
“This report includes several alarming findings, including that ‘the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.’  It also explicitly states that the president’s campaign took actions with an expectation that ‘it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts,’
“In his summary letter and press conference, Attorney General Barr presented a conclusion that the President did not obstruct justice. The Mueller report appears to directly undercut that claim.
Our Chairmen are studying the report, and have released a joint statement. As we continue to review this document, we will have more to report and will update you on the next steps that must be taken,” the letter continued. “The Caucus is scheduling a conference call for Monday to discuss this grave matter, which is as soon as our analysis and this Holy Season’s religious traditions allow.
“The Mueller report states, ‘We concluded Congress has authority to prohibit a president’s corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice,’ which ‘accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.’ Congress will not be silent.”
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) has already announced major new hearings in which he plans to call Barr and Mueller separately as star witnesses.
What else Pelosi and her team could do, short of impeachment, is not immediately clear.

483,Lawmakers Seek To Curb Tobacco Use Among Youth,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/lawmakers-seek-to-curb-tobacco-use-among-youth/,"So as to address a sharp rise in use of tobacco and e-cigarette products among young people, two House Democrats have introduced the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported an alarming 78 percent increase in current e-cigarette use by high school students and 48 percent increase among middle school students from 2017 to 2018.  According to reports, the sharp increase in tobacco use in recent years could reverse years of progress in reducing youth tobacco use in America, according to the lawmakers behind the new legislation, Reps. Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) and Donna Shalala (D-Fla.).
Pallone is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, while Shalala served as secretary of health and human services during the Clinton administration.

“The Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act makes clear that we will not tolerate the proliferation of slick new products purposefully designed to appeal to young people to get them addicted to nicotine and tobacco,” Pallone said.  “Congress must act to reduce youth nicotine addiction by making it clear that selling tobacco products to kids is illegal.  My legislation also treats e-cigarettes and other tobacco products the same as traditional cigarettes under the law. We cannot afford to wait – we are on the cusp of losing an entirely new generation to a lifetime of nicotine addiction.”
The Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019 includes a number of provisions to curb the rise of youth tobacco use:
Would require FDA to finalize a rule requiring graphic health warnings for cigarette packages within 12 months;
Would extend FDA regulations on the sale, distribution, and use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to all deemed tobacco products, including e-cigarettes;
Would raise the minimum age for purchasing tobacco products to 21 years and makes it unlawful for any retailer to sell a tobacco product to any person younger than 21 years of age;
Would direct FDA to prohibit non-face-to-face sales of all tobacco products including e-cigarettes and e-cigarette accessories;
Would prohibit all characterizing flavors of tobacco products, including menthol;
Would provide FDA with authority to collect user fees from all classes of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes;
Would instruct FDA to issue a final rule on the regulation of products containing synthetic nicotine or nicotine that is not made or derived from tobacco;
Would make it unlawful to market, advertise, or promote any e-cigarette products to individuals under the age of 21; and,
Would require the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to issue an annual report to Congress on the domestic sales, advertising, and promotional activity of cigarette, cigar, smokeless tobacco, and e-cigarette manufacturers.
Pallone and Shalala’s bill has widespread support from public health advocates, including: the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, American Lung Association, American Thoracic Society, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, March of Dimes, and National African American Tobacco Prevention Network.
“The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids strongly supports the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019, and we applaud Chairman Pallone for his leadership in introducing this comprehensive legislation to reverse the youth e-cigarette epidemic and continue driving down youth tobacco use,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “The bill’s prohibition on flavored tobacco products, including flavored e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes, is especially critical to stop tobacco companies from targeting kids with enticing flavors.  Flavored e-cigarettes have driven the youth epidemic, and more than half of youth smokers – including seven out of 10 African-American youth smokers – smoke menthol cigarettes, so it’s time to take these products off the market once and for all.”

484,Unveiling of Mueller Report Ends in Call for ‘Baghdad Bill’ Barr’s Resignation,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/unveiling-of-mueller-report-ends-in-call-for-baghdad-bill-barrs-resignation/,"Although the long-awaited Mueller Report finally was released Thursday–albeit in a redacted form–Attorney General William “Bill” Barr’s performance was widely panned, even on the conservative-friendly Fox News.
By the end of the day, Barr’s credibility had been criticized, and at least one prominent Democratic lawmaker had called for his resignation.
Since the weekend in March when special counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up his investigation and submitted his 400-page report to the Justice Department, Barr has seemingly been trying to shade and spin the contents of the report to the benefit of the target of that investigation, Donald Trump.
That behavior continued with an unusual press conference Barr led Thursday morning just prior to the release of the report covering the two-year probe looking into potential conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign in 2016, and and any subsequent obstruction of justice.
“I suspect that the president was pretty pleased with the performance of Bill Barr today and particularly on the issue of obstruction,” Fox News host Chris Wallace said on-air Thursday. “Because again, on collusion it does appear and I will say that the attorney general said it about a half dozen times, I lost count after that: ‘There was no collusion,’ ‘There was no cooperation,’ ‘There was no coordination.’ But there doesn’t seem to be any contradiction there.

“When it came to the obstruction case, and as he pointed out, there were at least 10 instances that the special counsel raised that could be considered potential obstruction,” Wallace added. “Then you got into this very curious area where the attorney general seemed almost to be acting as the counselor for the defense, the counselor for the president rather than the attorney general.”
Wallace wasn’t the only on-air host to feel the same way about Barr’s performance.
“Joyce, it’s already been mentioned around here that it would hearken back to a conflict decades ago, we would not be surprised if some headline writer somewhere came up with ‘Baghdad’ Bill Barr for what we saw today,” MSNBC host Brian Williams told former federal prosecutor Joyce Vance during one segment, referring to an Iraqi propaganda figure from the first Iraq War in 1991.
“I’ll read you four different quotes. ‘Put another way, the special counsel found no collusion by any Americans.’ Quote two, ‘In other words, there was no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government hacking.’ Quote three, ‘After finding no underlying collusion with Russia, the special counsel’s report goes on to consider whether certain actions of the president could amount to obstruction.’  And quote four, ‘Yet, as he, Donald Trump, said from the beginning, there was, in fact, no collusion.’ You and others have pointed out this word ‘collusion’ is not a term in the law,” Williams said.
Speaking on CNN, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said Barr clearly is acting the way he is to please Trump, and it proves that Barr is the wrong person in the job.
“He views himself as the lawyer for the president, not the lawyer for the people of the United States of America,” Schiff said. “And that’s the way to longevity in the Trump administration, which is you sing along the president’s songbook, whether that’s making bogus claims of spying on the president’s campaign or making bogus claims of no collusion.
“In fact, Bob Mueller was quite explicit that he didn’t reach whether collusion occurred as that term is known colloquially, only whether he could prove a criminal conspiracy in his attempts to sugarcoat what the president did,” Schiff added. “And gloss over the president’s refusal to cooperate with the investigation, refusal to testify verbally, his efforts to try to get others to mislead the country. I think Barr showed he should have never have been confirmed for the job in the first place.”
Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a colleague of Schiff’s on the Intelligence Committee and a recent entrant into the widening field of Democratic presidential hopefuls, specifically called on Barr to resign.
“He can either be the attorney general of the United States or the president’s lawyer. He can’t be both and he’s been acting as the president’s lawyer in the way that he applied for the job, the way he refused to recuse himself and the way he’s accused the FBI and intelligence community of spying on the administration,” Swalwell said. “And his mischaracterization today of what the Mueller report actually shows. He should go.”
Yet another House Intelligence Committee member, Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.), accused Barr of misrepresenting the contents of the Mueller Report to the American people.

“We have to get special counsel Robert Mueller there to testify. A question he will be asked and I expect he will be asked is based upon your findings: If you were a member of Congress, would you move forward with impeachment proceedings? He should be able to answer that. It’s a question that every member of Congress will answer for themselves. The Judiciary Committee first.
“It’s clear today that the attorney general, Barr, has been doing a real public relations campaign for the president for a few weeks now and really trying to soften the blow, so to speak. Now that we have the final report, we know that it’s much worse than what the attorney general has been making it out to be,” Castro added.

485,"Despite Trump’s Hopes, Matter Doesn’t End With Report’s Release",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/despite-trumps-hopes-matter-doesnt-end-with-reports-release/,"Donald Trump may have begun Thursday prior to the release of the Mueller Report with yet another round of victorious tweets, and Attorney General William “Bill” Barr may have held a press conference laying out a case of essentially exoneration for the president.
But, then, finally came the long-awaited main event: the release of a partially redacted Mueller Report–400 pages to sum up a two-year investigation into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election, as well as any subsequent obstruction of justice.
Trump began his day tweeting: “No Collusion. No Obstruction. For the haters and the radical left Democrats — Game Over.”
But reality is that this is anything but “game over,” particularly after a press conference in which even Fox News host Chris Wallace described Barr’s behavior as that more like a personal “counselor for the president, rather than the attorney general.”
Among the findings in the report:
Special counsel Robert Mueller outlined at least 10 episodes where Trump tried to interfere with the investigation.
Mueller left it to Congress to ultimately determine if there was obstruction of justice.
Trump was lying when he claimed “complete and total exoneration.”
“The differences are stark between what Attorney General Barr said on obstruction and what Special Counsel Mueller said on obstruction,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a joint statement released once the Mueller Report was issued.
“As we continue to review the report, one thing is clear: Attorney General Barr presented a conclusion that the president did not obstruct justice while Mueller’s report appears to undercut that finding,” the joint statement added.

Pelosi and Schumer also jointly called on Mueller himself to testify before both the House and Senate as soon as possible.
“Attorney General Barr’s regrettably partisan handling of the Mueller report, including his slanted March 24th summary letter, his irresponsible testimony before Congress last week, and his indefensible plan to spin the report in a press conference later this morning — hours before he allows the public or Congress to see it — have resulted in a crisis of confidence in his independence and impartiality. We believe the only way to begin restoring public trust in the handling of the Special Counsel’s investigation is for Special Counsel Mueller himself to provide public testimony in the House and Senate as soon as possible. The American people deserve to hear the truth,” Pelosi and Schumer said in a separate statement.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) took Barr to task for his overly pro-Trump stances, announcing that he would both have Barr before the committee for testimony May 3, and would subpoena the full, unredacted Mueller Report.
“Even in its incomplete form, the Mueller report outlines disturbing evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction of justice and other misconduct,” Nadler said.
“The report concluded there was ‘substantial evidence’ that President Trump attempted to prevent an investigation into his campaign and his own conduct. Contrary to the Attorney General’s statement this morning that the White House ‘fully cooperated’ with the investigation, the report makes clear that the President refused to be interviewed by the Special Counsel and refused to provide written answers to follow-up questions; and his associates destroyed evidence relevant to the Russia investigation,” he added.
“The Special Counsel determined that he would not make a traditional charging decision in part because of the Department of Justice policy that a sitting President could not be indicted. Rather, the Special Counsel’s office conducted an incredibly thorough investigation in order to preserve the evidence for future investigators. The Special Counsel made clear that he did not exonerate the President. The responsibility now falls to Congress to hold the President accountable for his actions,” Nadler continued.

“Today and during the past few weeks, Attorney General Barr appears to have shown an unsettling willingness to undermine his own Department in order to protect President Trump. The redacted report directly contradicts several statements he made during his press conference earlier today.  For example, the Special Counsel concluded that a ‘thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the President personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would have risen to personal and political concerns.’ Barr excluded this critical finding from his version of events,” the chairman said.
“The Attorney General’s decision to withhold the full report from Congress is regrettable, but no longer surprising. If he was willing to release this evidence, which is so clearly damaging to the President, just imagine what remains hidden from our view. Barr has so far refused to work with the Committee to provide us with information which has been customarily provided in the past, and to which we are entitled. These concerns and many others will be addressed when Barr testifies before the Committee on May 2nd. Additionally, I have formally requested that Special Counsel Mueller testify before our Committee by May 23rd.
“Contrary to public reports, I have not heard from the [Justice] Department about receiving a less-redacted version of the report. Because Congress requires this material in order to perform our constitutionally-mandated responsibilities, I will issue a subpoena for the full report and the underlying materials.
“I have been and continue to be prepared to make every effort to work with the Attorney General to find a solution that allows Congress to review the entire record—and not merely the fragments he chose to share with us today,” Nadler concluded.

486,False Solutions to the Immigration Crisis — And What Will Really Work,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/false-solutions-to-the-immigration-crisis-and-what-will-really-work/,"There is a border/immigration crisis but the way it is being handled and perceived (and even “fought”) is abysmal. It has alienated allies in Mexico (and even Canada) and could be solved through a more bipartisan approach with less Twittering and knee-jerk policymaking.

Here are six things that haven’t (and most likely won’t) worked so far:
Erecting a Wall and “making the Mexicans pay for it.” (El Paso’s mayor recently said that approach is “malarkey.”)
Finding a way to keep Mexicans from entering. Guess what, it ain’t Mexicans so much anymore–it’s Guatemalans, El. Salvadorians and Hondurans
Erecting a Wall (round 2) and making the government (via citizens) pay for it. Word to wise, it didn’t stop El Chapo, and most illegals come through border checkpoints clandestinely.
Splitting up families at the border to discourage them from entering. Believe it or not, it’s on the possibility list again despite the last outcry.
Closing the border entirely–only a few billion dollars in commerce would be affected…Chump (Trump?) change? Hardly, and what happens to the new USMCA agreed upon?
Sending all illegals to “sanctuary cities.” Guess what, Mr. Trump, most will take them willingly and then assimilate them… You don’t want that to work against you in the next election.  

Grasping at straws and throwing policy canards at a wall to see if they will stick isn’t good governance. Here’s some that are.  
Mary O’Grady, the “Americas” columnist for the Wall Street Journal, says that the way to discourage Central American migrants is by beefing up their infrastructure, especially the electrical grid. That way industries can be developed to adequately employ their people. Mr. Trump has threatened to cut off all aid to these migrant originating countries without even suggesting sensible incentives.  
Replace a broken system of asylum. Set up application processes with enough personnel to vet the truly endangered and traumatized. Give those released an incentive to want to come back and eventually get approved on their way to citizenship.  
Encourage Mexican assistance to Central American migrants in a holding pattern south of the borders. At least setup camps and temporary schools. And offer a little aid to the government?  
Recognize the fact that the U.S. needs more immigrants — even unskilled ones — to replace retiring workers and offset a decreasing birthrate among Caucasians. Expand temporary H1A agriculture visas, with better tracking upon their expiration.  
Create an amnesty program for illegal immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at at least five years, who avoid any criminal activity, and who sign a pledge willing to work toward becoming citizens.   It is not just the United States that is struggling with migration issues. The world is full of dispossessed, oppressed and poverty-stricken peoples seeking better lives across borders.

Ultimately, overpopulation and population distribution issues must be focused upon, and birth control made more universal despite religious objections. The planet is full and getting fuller.   None of these proposals need to be adopted immediately but without them, the situation just gets worse. Think about it.

487,House Chairmen Want To Get to Bottom of Immigration Plan DHS Apparently Found Illegal,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/house-chairmen-want-to-get-to-bottom-of-immigration-plan-dhs-apparently-found-illegal/,"A trio of House committee chairmen are seeking answers from the White House and the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) related to a politically motivated plan for undocumented immigrants in federal custody.
The plan from Donald Trump would involve moving immigrants in federal custody to so-called sanctuary cities, which are jurisdictions across the country that choose not to cooperate with federal immigration crackdown actions.
Such jurisdictions typically are governed by Democrats, and Trump has long been angry with Democrats for opposing his hardline immigration policies, particularly the wall he wants to build along the border with Mexico.
The committee chairmen sent a letter to the DHS and the White House requesting documents regarding the proposal to release detained immigrants into congressional districts represented by Democrats for purely political reasons.

The letter follows the president’s acknowledgement that the administration is actively considering this proposal and his claim that he has the “absolute legal right” to release immigrants into sanctuary cities across the country.
The letter was signed by House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), House Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), and House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.).
“We are deeply troubled by multiple reports, recently confirmed by the President, that the Trump Administration is considering releasing detained immigrants into congressional districts represented by Democrats in a bizarre and unlawful attempt to score political points,” the chairmen wrote. “Not only does the Administration lack the legal authority to transfer detainees in this manner, it is shocking that the President and senior Administration officials are even considering manipulating release decisions for purely political reasons.”
Although Trump claims to have an “absolute legal right” to undertake this latest immigration scheme, that’s not actually true, according to Jake Tapper, of CNN.
DHS General Counsel John Mitnick provided the White House a three-part legal analysis why it would be illegal, Tapper said.
One part of the analysis found DHS is not allowed to spend its money to do this, to transport these individuals, unless it’s for a “clear agency-related purpose” such as providing medical care to individuals or facilities becoming overcrowded, Tapper said.
“And the underlying message is: ‘We can’t do this for political reasons, that would be against our charter, that would be against the law,'” he said.
Mitnick made two other points, Tapper said.

“This would open up the agency and the U.S. government to lawsuits because you’ll be denying due process to these individuals,” Tapper said.
“And if you do this, the odds that these individuals do not show up for their deportation hearing are much stronger,” he added. “So in other words, you’ll be undermining the law and you’ll be undermining your own purpose of wanting these people to go back where they came from.”

488,"Trump, Pelosi Finally Agree: Both Say ‘No’ to Socialism",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-pelosi-finally-agree-both-say-no-to-socialism/,"Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Nancy Pelosi have long been political adversaries, going tooth-and-nail, particularly since Democrats took the House majority and elevated Pelosi once again to speaker.
However, it appears that they’ve finally found some common ground: both are unreservedly rejecting socialism as an element of American politics and economics.
This is despite a growing number of public opinion polls which indicate the American people are warming to the idea of socialism.

For instance, nearly a decade ago, 68 percent of young people, 18 to 29 years old, said they approved of capitalism, while 51 percent said they approved of socialism, according to a Gallup survey. But by 2018, moods changed to supporting socialism over capitalism, 51 percent to 45 percent.
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-identified democratic socialist, did much to expose Americans to–and win them over to–socialism when he first ran for president in 2016. Sanders may have come in second that year to Hillary Clinton, but he did garner 12 million votes.
He’s established himself as a front-runner this year in an increasingly crowded field, as he takes another run for the Democratic nomination.
Moreover, several new members of Congress who identify as democratic socialists were elected in the 2018 midterm elections. They are informally led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), known in the media as “AOC.”

“The numbers of blue-collar jobs have recently grown the fastest rate in more than 31 years, so that’s what we’re talking about. They can talk all they want about socialism. All socialism is, is a method into the poor house,” Trump said. “Socialism is not so easy to beat when an economy is really doing well like ours.”
Asked during an interview with the 60 Minutes news program about Trump calling all Democrats “socialists” as a political attack to paint them as too extreme, Pelosi responded that Republicans have been trying that tactic for decades.
“You know that when Medicare was done in Congress at the time, under [President] Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan said Medicare would lead us to a socialist dictatorship. This is an ongoing theme of the Republicans,” she said.
“However, I do reject socialism as an economic system,” Pelosi added. “If people have that view, that’s their view. That is not the view of the Democratic Party.”
Asked during the same interview about Ocasio-Cortez and her ideological allies in the House, Pelosi dismissed that group by saying, “That’s like five people.”

489,"The First Amendment, Georgia-Style",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-first-amendment-georgia-style/,"Here’s a club that six Georgia Republicans want the state to join:
Russia
North Korea
Saudi Arabia
Vietnam
Iran
China
Myanmar
Cuba
These are just a few of the countries who exercise government censorship of the press, and there are dozens more. Let’s just say most of them aren’t on America’s Christmas card list, and a small cadre of GOP lawmakers want to join their ranks by enacting Draconian restrictions regarding media access to the people who do the people’s business in government. Here’s a rundown of the authoritarian nonsense these small-government hypocrites — State representatives Andy Welch, Tim Barr, Rick Jasperse, Ron Stephens, Mike Cheokas, and Mark Newton — birthed in their addled raisin-sized brain meats:

The measure seeks to create a 9-member Journalism Ethics Board responsible for:
Accrediting journalists and organizations;
Entire news organizations would only be accredited if every journalist in the organization was accredited;
Investigating and sanctioning journalists after complaints are filed by the public;
Allows for public and private reprimand, probation, and revocation of accreditation;
Accepting and managing grants, donations, gifts, and other monetary awards;
Setting rules and standards to adhere to for ‘factual and ethical reporting.;
Additionally, the bill requires that media outlets turn over any video and audio recordings in unedited format as well as photographs taken during an interview at no charge upon request by the person interviewed. It sets a 60-day window from the date of the interview to request the files, sets a timeframe to fulfill the request, and allows for private action against the media outlet or journalist for failing to comply, assessing a $100 per day penalty.
Of course, liberals will start writing about this as the first step toward fascism (as if we haven’t seen that already), and quote everyone from Thomas Jefferson to Adolph Hitler to make their point, hyperbole be damned. But we’ve heard those arguments before. Instead, I think it’s important to hear what key conservatives have to say about the issue.

Donald Rumsfeld was a Republican figure for multiple decades, having served in the House of Representatives and later as everything from a senior advisor to Defense Secretary under presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and George W. Bush. Certainly, he would stand with Georgia Republicans, right?
“I recognize the need to provide the press – and, through you, the American people – with information to the fullest extent possible,” Rumsfeld was quoted as saying in a speech. “In our democracy, the work of the Pentagon press corps is important, defending our freedom and way of life is what this conflict is about, and that certainly includes freedom of the press.”
The late former Republican Vice President Spiro T. Agnew was dogged by investigative reporters and stories of corruption until he was forced to resign in 1973. Surely, he’d see the need for press restrictions.
“Every time I criticize what I consider to be excesses or faults in the news business, I am accused of repression, and the leaders of various media professional groups wave the First Amendment as they denounce me,” Agnew said. “That happens to be my amendment, too. It guarantees my free speech as it does their freedom of the press… There is room for all of us – and for our divergent views – under the First Amendment.”
Finally, no one in Republican politics has been pilloried quite like the Mama Grizzly herself, former Alaska Governor and VP candidate Sarah Palin. If anyone would have inspired Republicans to advocated press restrictions, it would have been her.
“I want to make a toast to all at this press event who agree with Thomas Jefferson, who said that our liberty depends on the freedom of the press,” Palin said at a press dinner. “So I want to lift a glass to those who defend that freedom. Our finest, the men and women in uniform who defend that freedom, our Constitution, and our exceptional way of life in America.”

Bottom line, you can’t be a defender of the Constitution and an advocate of deregulation and small government if you’re also willing to throw the First Amendment baby out with the Constitutional bathwater. These Republicans want a government just big enough to silence their critics. It’s hypocrisy, honed to a sharp, precision edge that would begin slicing all of our liberties to ribbons, and if enacted, it would be used at the pleasure of whichever political party is in power. Bad news for the GOP when it loses power. This measure needs to be rejected swiftly and soundly, and the pea-brains who came up with it need to be made to sit in the corner with dunce caps until the 2020 session.

490,Julian Castro’s Immigration Plan Includes ‘Marshall Plan for Central America and Latin America’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/julian-castros-immigration-plan-includes-marshall-plan-for-central-america-and-latin-america/,"Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro has an immigration reform plan which he would try to enact into law if elected president.
That plan includes a “21st century Marshall Plan” to assist nations in Central America so as to reduce incentive to make the trek north to the United States, according to Castro, a former Cabinet official in the Obama administration.
Although apprehensions by US authorities is way down from historical highs in 2000, incumbent Donald Trump has forced immigration to the top of the national agenda, as he ultimately wants to construct a wall along the border with Mexico to further stem immigration.

Speaking on-air during a town hall-style event, Castro particularly took issue with Trump for his administration’s previous policy of family separation which was supposed to be a deterrent to immigration.
“We need to make sure that people who are presenting themselves for asylum can make that claim. Secondly, I don’t think that we should treat them as criminals,” he said. “Up until about 2004 we actually treated somebody crossing the border as a civil violation, not a criminal one.
“In fact, it is the fact that we’ve treated it as a criminal violation that has led to this incarceration, this family detention, the backlog that exists today. I believe that we should treat it as a civil violation, people still are part of an immigration process, they still have to come to their court hearings, we still will monitor them, we still have the option to deport them, the fact is that most people who are seeking asylum you know may not get it but some will and we should hear their claims,” said Castro, a native of Texas who served as mayor of San Antonio before joining the Obama Cabinet.
Part of being “smarter” about immigration would be the creation of this “21st century Marshall Plan” aimed at several Central American nations. The original Marshall Plan was a massive rebuilding and aid package for the nations of Europe hit by the devastation of World War II. The effects and goodwill generated by that program created for the United States a constellation of allies.

“The problem is that folks can’t find safety and opportunity in Honduras or El Salvador or Guatemala. If we can partner with those countries so that people can find safety and opportunity there, instead of having to come and knock on the door of the United States that’s what they want,” Castro said. “That is going to be better for those countries in the long run that also addresses the issue that you’re talking about, which is 92,000 people coming to the southern border in one month.”

491,Ilhan Omar Has a Legitimate Point ‘Muslims Are Unfairly Demonized’ After 9/11,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/ilhan-omar-has-a-legitimate-point-muslims-are-unfairly-demonized-after-9-11/,"Caught up in the battle over the politics and semantics of Rep. Ilhan Omar’s statements about the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, appears to be lost a larger point.
Although he criticized Omar’s word choice as “flip,” for describing the events of that day and that she may have misstated the origin date of the Muslim group she was speaking to, TV commentator Juan Williams said that the Minnesota Democrat made a valid and important overall point.
“She has a legitimate point, she’s misstated the date when CAIR was founded, but she has a legitimate point in terms of whether or not there were fellow Americans who are Muslim were unfairly demonized in the aftermath of” September 11, Williams said.
The impact on the US Muslim community is not merely the opinion of Omar or Williams or others–but a sad, brutal fact brought home in ugly and quantifiable statistics, and often brutal anecdotal evidence, as well.
Researchers found that half of Americans say Islam is not part of “mainstream American society,” and 41 percent say Islam encourages violence more than other faiths. At the same time, they found an increase in the number of American Muslims who feel that they are “viewed with suspicion.”

Assaults against US Muslims spiked between 2015 and 2016, past the levels seen even in the aftermath of the September 11, according to Pew research.
Unlike President George W. Bush–who actively sought to ease and reprisals against American Muslims in the wake of the attacks–during the 2015-2016 period Donald Trump was talking up his proposed total Muslim ban as he campaigned for president.
Anti-Muslim violence continued above historical averages in 2017, according to reported US law enforcement data.
A 26-year-old man was sentenced to nearly 25 years in prison last year for torching a mosque in the Houston area of Texas.
Even the attacks being aimed at Omar herself put not only the congresswoman, but all American Muslims, in danger, said Sen. Cory Booker, noting that he represents many constituents affected by September 11 as a New Jersey Democrat.
“I think that what she is experiencing right now, she does not deserve — from what she said in her speech, she does not deserve the kind of vicious, hate-filled attacks that she’s experiencing, threats on her life, right now,” said Booker, one of nearly 20 contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. “We all as Americans should say that is outrageous and unacceptable. And what Donald Trump is doing is he is making life dangerous not just for her, but for other Muslim Americans.”

492,Trump: ‘The Race to 5G Is a Race that America Must Win’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/trump-the-race-to-5g-is-a-race-that-america-must-win/,"Donald Trump at the White House kicked off the race for the United States to take the lead in the global race for leadership in the next-generation, transformational 5G wireless technology.
“Secure 5G networks will absolutely be a vital link to America’s prosperity and national security in the 21st century,” Trump said. “5G will be as much as 100 times faster than the current 4G cellular networks. It will transform the way our citizens work, learn, communicate and travel. It will make American farms more productive, American manufacturing more competitive, and American healthcare better and more accessible. Basically it covers almost everything when you get right down to it — pretty amazing.
“And just as 4G networks paved the way for smart phones and all of the exciting breakthroughs that are made possible, so many things. This will be more secure and resilient,” Trump added.

5G technology is scheduled to be rolled out next year, and aside from simply providing increased network speed, the new networks will also be expected to meet the needs of such innovative applications as the so-called Internet of Things as well as broadcast-like services and enhanced disaster communications.
These new applications are expected to lead to advancements in everything from sensors for eldercare, to transportation.
“5G networks will also create astonishing and really thrilling new opportunities for our people. Opportunities that we’ve never even thought we had a possibility of looking at,” Trump said. “We cannot allow any other country to outcompete the United States in this powerful industry of the future. We are leading by so much in so many different industries of that type, that we just can’t let that happen.
“The race to 5G is a race that America must win and it’s a race, frankly, that our great companies are now involved in,” he added.
Trump was joined at his White House event by Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
“Well, 5G means the fifth generation of wireless connectivity, just as 4G was the fourth generation. 5G means 100 times faster speed than 4G. It means incredibly high rates of data being sent over the wireless airwaves,” Pai said. “But ultimately, it’s going to transform industries and deliver applications and services to consumers, some of which we can’t even conceive today. And that’s why it’s so important for America to lead on this next generation of technology.”

493,Is it Ever Okay for Politicians to Swear?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/is-it-ever-okay-for-politicians-to-swear/,"Yes
Featuring: Matthew Ryan, Esq. Flushing Law Group
As a conservative, my thoughts on this issue have evolved over the last twenty years.  While at one time the notion of having a politician cussing would have been a disqualifying act in terms of my ability to vote for the said politician, I now feel that such an act is no big deal if done sparingly and non-gratuitously.  The fact is that our culture has changed over these last thirty years and while I once thought that politicians should be role models for the youth of today, I no longer feel that is the role of politicians in twenty-first century America.  
Today, a politician must be real and authentic above every consideration if he wants to spearhead a political cause and he needs to mirror the times we live in.  I admit that I find it personally sad that the era of cussing being negatively perceived is a fact of a bygone time but I recognize that politicians are a mere reflection of our American culture in the modern era.  Ultimately, I would not hold it against someone if they did not want to vote for a politician who cussed as being too coarse for the culture, as I once thought similarly myself.

Depends On Words
Featuring: Vivian Young, Senior Content Manager, Website Greenlight
Potty mouth should be banished from the political arena. Period. Leave it
out of speeches. Zip your lip during impromptu media appearances and don’t blurt it out in an effort to look cool in late night talk shows. And for heaven’s sake, ditto in the Twittersphere.
To clarify, I’m talking about f-bombs and serious swear words starting with
b, d, f and s. Don’t make me spell it out for you. Use your imagination.
Receive the Latest Bipartisan News

Politicians should set examples for all of us, from small children and high school students to the elderly. Granted, young kids won’t understand complicated terminology pertaining to economics, job growth, immigration,
and health care reform. But they will understand swear words when uttered by an adult.
I don’t care what you say behind closed doors or off mic. We are all guilty
of using swear words to an extent. I just don’t want to hear it on a political platform. Politicians need to lead by example. There’s a huge difference between being labeled foul-mouthed versus the occasional swearer. Too much-unchecked profanity has the potential to hurt, to wound and, to anger the receiver.

I will give you the respect you deserve. It’s okay to be human. Just keep your emotions in check. And resurrect swear words that your grandfather said back in the day – dagnabit, holy moly, fiddlesticks, son of a gun, and hell’s bells. That’ll get people’s attention! And maybe their vote.
No
Featuring: Aïda Muñoz, Producer, The Actor’s Workshop
This is a subject dear to me. I most emphatically believe politicians should not swear in public! The discourse in social media and even out in a real-life public place is already coarse enough — people casually spouting profanities, obscenities and vulgarities that are by their nature and definition ugly and offensive to many. It’s like screenwriting: you can certainly pepper your script with f-words to make it seem real but it does not constitute good writing. Far better for a public person to show control and restraint. I say this because I work with children and am sensitive to what they pick up in the media. Now, in private, people should be able to express themselves a little more loosely. I also believe that some things expressed privately should not be spoken of in the same way publicly. 

This was a sore point recently when a Congresswoman from my state, Representative Rashida Tlaib, hurled an obscenity about the president. While I agree with the standpoint, I did not like how she chose to publicly express it! Representative Ocasio-Cortez made a smoothing-over point that it was a curse word uttered in a bar, but even so, a politician needs to exhibit more professional speech. 
Depends On Who
Featuring: Gary Schneeberger, President & Chief Leonine Officer, We Roar
It depends on what that politician’s constituency expects of the politician. In other words, if his or her political and personal brand is maverick, millennial, straight-shooter, about people, not politics, then, it’s not only OK, but probably a plus, to drop a few salty words on the campaign trail or in a press conference. Ideology makes little difference here: Beto O’Rourke and Donald Trump can both drop f-bombs in speeches because those who support them view them doing so as evidence of their not being like other politicians. Swearing is the new black in appealing to the new or fed-up voter. 
But imagine George W. Bush — a favorite of the Christian right, the guy who said as a candidate that Jesus was his favorite philosopher — going all Gordon Ramsay in a stump speech. He was the son of a president, the scion of the political Ewings or Carringtons. Using his just-us-guys voice in a political context would have disappointed many of his supporters and alienated more than a few. Hillary Clinton likely would have the same limitations — diametrically opposed politically, but also a branch on a political family tree from whom a little more decorum was expected — at least in public discourse if not private behavior. 

Ditto for someone like Ted Cruz — currently holding hearings to scold digital entertainment companies freezing out ads for the pro-life film UNPLANNED. His profile is that of a family man and family champion — he needs to speak in more traditional, measured, beyond-the-locker-room ways to fit his brand and the expectations of his base. In the same way, Elizabeth Warren is probably not going to be tossing about George Carlin’s seven dirty words you can’t say on television — she’s projects as the country’s feisty but classy aunt. Nothing to gain for her by going blue.

494,Plan To Send Immigrants to ‘Sanctuary Cities’ A Case of ‘Political Retaliation’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/democrats/disrespectful-plan-to-send-immigrants-to-sanctuary-cities-likely-meant-to-stir-trump-base-not-actually-happen/,"Donald Trump’s proposal to somehow house any influx of immigrants coming through the US border within the nation’s network of so-called “sanctuary cities” may likely be nothing more than a political ploy to stoke his political base rather than actually comprise any real policy.
Still, Trump’s surprise announcement–which comes as a bit of a middle finger at his political opponents–has those same opponents of his hardline immigration policies outraged and worried.
Trump apparently sees this idea as a jab at the largely Democratic and progressive officials who, thus far, have both stymied his attempts to build the wall he craves and also support the sanctuary cities which have refused to cooperate with the round-ups of undocumented immigrants which began early in Trump’s administration.
“If we had the wall, people wouldn’t be coming up. Mexico is now apprehending and bringing back to the various countries that we’re talking about, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador. They’re bringing people back to those countries, Colombia, to a certain extent. They’re going back to those countries. But, we could fix that, and so fast, if the Democrats would agree,” Trump said. “But if they don’t agree, we might as well do what they always say they want. We’ll bring the illegal, really, you call them the illegals. I call them the illegals. They came across the border illegally.
“We’ll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it, whether it’s a state or whatever it might be. California certainly is always saying, ‘We want more people.’ They want more people in their sanctuary cities. Well, we’ll give them more people,” Trump added. “We can give them a lot. We can give them an unlimited supply. Let’s see if they’re so happy.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi derided Trump’s plan as yet one more in a string of inhumane policies to address immigration.

“I don’t know anything about it, but again, it’s not just another notion that is unworthy of the presidency of the United States and disrespectful of the challenges that we face as a country, as a people, to address who we are, a nation of immigrants,” Pelosi said. “I don’t think it is a statement of American values to take children out of the arms of their parents to say what might be two years before we reunite them, either you don’t know what you’re talking about or you don’t know what bonding between parent and child, whether it’s father, mother and child is. So, what the president is doing is, in my view, terribly wrong.”
Although Trump often portrays immigrants entering the United States as dangerous, statistics indicate that the opposite is true, according to Libby Schaaf, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, Calif. (Jerry Brown, then the Democratic governor of California signed a law in 2017 declaring the entire state a “sanctuary state.”)
“The data is very clear that immigrants and even undocumented immigrants commit far fewer crimes than non-immigrants. The data is clear, sanctuary cities like Oakland are actually getting safer,” Schaaf said. “We believe that there is safety and harmony in diversity and inclusion. And there is plenty of research to back that up. But what’s really outrageous is the way that this administration continues to use petty politics and really just vitriolic rhetoric to advance a racist agenda. This is not American.”
The ongoing need for sanctuary cities is tied to the lack of Washington policymakers completing comprehensive immigration reform, according to Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.).
“And what we’ve seen is a president that … from his very first moments of announcing his candidacy, has gone to fear, division, racism, and called that up in the American people,” she said. “It is time that he be the leader that we need and say, ‘Let’s look at our system, let’s see how we can protect our national security and have an immigration system that makes sense, and that allows people to immigrate into this country to fill some of the needs we have for workers and that is really in line with our heritage and values as Americans. That we embrace immigrants and we replenish ourselves with immigrants and what they bring to us.’
“But this president is committed to doing the opposite and you can see it from the absolute chaos that he has created in the Department of Homeland Security that is a reflection of the chaos on the border,” Clark added.
But in the end, the proposal is probably all politics–not policy, said Fox News host Chris Wallace.

It’s largely simple “political retaliation,” Wallace said.
“Here’s my guess, and it is only a guess, take it for what it’s worth: This will never happen, this is the president saying, ‘We’re not going to cower and try to pretend we didn’t really do this. I’m going to double-down and suggest it. My base will like it.’ But will it ever happen? I would be shocked.”

495,The Divide Caused by Social Media,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-divide-caused-by-social-media/,"The digital world has become essential in the functioning of society. As it connects people of culturally diverse backgrounds and intends to break down racial barriers, it also succeeds in dividing the partisan line even further.
Receive the Latest Bipartisan News

In this week’s media focus, Facebook stood in front of the U.S. Congress, along with other tech giants, to combat the rise of white nationalism on their sites. There’s no denying the presence of social media and its role in online radicalization, but unfortunately, that’s just the tip of the iceberg.
Our hatred and discrimination goes beyond our Facebook timelines and Twitter feeds. Social exclusion and media bias have had a history in traditional media since the nineteenth century. Racial and cultural division have rapidly intensified and reached new heights while being institutionalized through generations.
The true role of mainstream media comes into question when we look further into the way we absorb information and change our perceptions in today’s political landscape. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting aims to “promote an educated and informed civil society by supporting high-quality engaging content and services delivered across multiple platforms” through public media.

We place emphasis on the word civil – relating to the general public, the greater good of the people, being well-rounded in courtesy and politeness toward others. How do you perceive civility?
At the crossroads of social media and politics comes a reflection of the 2016 Presidential Election. The roles that networking sites played in the national discourse of election season was crucial — do we recall the infamous Twitter exchange about student debt between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush? Education reform is the very core of our nation’s future and should be treated with high value. Yet, informally trolling on social media seemed to be the norm among most candidates.
From first announcing his 2016 campaign on Twitter to his tweets just this week regarding immigration laws, President Trump has set a precedent for future White House leaders as having the most argumentative online presence. His globalization of social media has created an online political sphere where users are continuously using the internet for partisan gain.
A recent study by online security service Comparitech surveyed more than 1,000 people who have at least one social media account on their political views — they found that 48% of people only interact with people on social media who generally share their views. This data shows the negativity brewing towards the opposing party as well as the growing rift between Democratic and Republican values on the internet.

Once again reflecting on civility, there’s an obvious lack of kindness in today’s online political landscape. When asked to distinguish political discussions on social media compared to before the 2016 election, one of the biggest changes voters noticed is the absence of respect. An overwhelming amount of users (58%) believe that political talk online is less respectful than it was before Donald Trump took his seat at the White House. Given his Republican-based presidency, it should come as no surprise that Democrats are now 38% more likely to post about politics on social media than in 2016 — does this open the door to a deeper conversation about political relationships?
As we continuously share ‘engaging’ political content in our own opinions across multiple platforms, it’s our purpose to give a voice to the voiceless, to empower the uninformed and promote unity. Or, are we unintentionally contributing to an already eminent cultural divide?

496,Trump: ‘More Troops to The Border’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-more-troops-to-the-border/,"Donald Trump is pledging to send further US troops to the border with Mexico to assist Border Patrol agents in their efforts to apprehend migrants and otherwise stem the tide of immigration through the southern border.
“We’re going to put more troops on the border. We’re going to — and you know, the thing is, our country’s doing so well economically. We’re setting records that a lot of people are coming up for that reason,” Trump said from the White House. “A lot of people are coming up for bad reasons, too. We have a lot of very, very bad people with big criminal records trying to get through. And the Border Patrol’s done an incredible job with them. Those are our focus.”
Trump first began sending US troops to the southern border last fall ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, as a wave, or so-called “caravan” of migrants from Central America north toward the United States.
US troops on the border are prohibited themselves from undertaking domestic law enforcement, but support Border Patrol agents who do.

This week, in an interview with Vice President Pence, CNN journalist Dana Bash noted, “The president tweeted last night the following: ‘I think what the Democrats are doing with the border is TREASONOUS. Their open-border mindset is putting our country at risk. Will not let that happen.’”
Addressing the vice president, Bash said, “I know you generally say that the president has his own style of talking, but to use the word ‘treason,’ which is supposed to be punished by death, how do you get from that rhetoric to working across the aisle the way you are talking about that’s needed to fix things here?”
“I think what you hear the president expressing is the frustration of the American people,” Pence replied. “Last month alone, more than 100,000 people came across our southern border illegally.”
Democrats, particularly those in the US House, have led the way in trying to block Trump’s ultimate policy goal, which is construction of a wall or barrier along the southern border. Most recently, the House was authorized to take legal action against the “state of emergency” Trump declared in order to bypass Congress and use military funds for wall construction.

497,Hillary: Assange Must Answer For What He’s Done,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/hillary-assange-must-answer-for-what-hes-done/,"Julian Assange, the newly jailed founder of the WikiLeaks organization, must now be held to account for his alleged crimes, according to former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton.
Assange, 47, was plucked from his sanctuary at the Embassy of Ecuador in London Thursday, arrested by British police conducting an arrest “on behalf of the United States.” He had been staying in the embassy since 2012 to avoid charges of an alleged sexual assault and rape in Sweden. However, his Ecuadorian hosts revoked his asylum after souring on him as a house-guest.
Assange, who appeared to resist arrest, reportedly will fight extradition, a process which could take several years to sort out.
He is being charged in the United States related to obtaining and publishing military files nearly a decade ago now related to US operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as publishing a cache of US diplomatic cables. Much of the military material was provided by American Chelsea Manning, who was serving in uniform at the time. She served seven years in prison for that action, before her sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama before he left office.
While many around the world were worried for signal the arrest of Assange would have on press freedoms for the work of releasing government documents, Clinton did not see it that way.
“Well, look, I think it’s clear from the indictment that came out that it’s not about punishing journalism,” she said. “It’s about assisting the hacking of the military computer to steal information from the United States government. And, look, I’ll wait and see what happens with the charges and how it proceeds, but he skipped bail in the U.K., Sweden had those charges which were then dropped in the last several years, but the bottom line is that he has to answer for what he has done, at least as it has been charged.
“I do think it’s a little ironic that he may be the only foreigner that this administration would welcome to the United States,” Clinton quipped, apparently referring to Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies.
Clinton, however, can hardly be called a disinterested observer when it comes to Assange and WikiLeaks. Trump associate Roger Stone is said to have worked with WikiLeaks to engineer a hack and dump from the Democratic National Committee leading up to the 2016 presidential election in order to damage Clinton politically, who, at the time, was the Democratic nominee and widely favored to win the presidency.

At the time, during a campaign rally in October 2016 in Pennsylvania, Trump enthused, “WikiLeaks. I love WikiLeaks!”
However, since then, the WikiLeaks DNC hack has been connected to the broader Russian attempt to meddle in the election. And Trump’s old pal Roger Stone could now go to prison for his role in the affair.
This week, after the Assange takedown, Trump had this to say: “I know nothing about WikiLeaks. It’s not my thing. And I know there was something having to do with Julian Assange.”
Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Commiteè and has played a key role in the investigations into Russia’s attack on the 2016. Whatever noble, whistleblower role Assange and WikiLeaks may once have had, they cannot escape their role in that attack, he said.
“Julian Assange has long professed high ideals and moral superiority. Unfortunately, whatever his intentions when he started WikiLeaks, what he’s really become is a direct participant in Russian efforts to undermine the West and a dedicated accomplice in efforts to undermine American security,” Warner said. “It is my hope that the British courts will quickly transfer him to U.S. custody so he can finally get the justice he deserves.”

498,Ilhan Omar Tells Colbert: ‘I’m There To Make Good Trouble’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/ilhan-omar-tells-colbert-im-there-to-make-good-trouble/,"Under fire again for her remarks, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) appeared on Stephen Colbert’s late-night TV show to explain why she felt she had to rebuff House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who’s suggested freshmen lawmakers need to “go slow.”
Rep. Omar bristled at the advice, telling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that Pelosi “knows” women don’t make progress by “going slow.”
“Nancy knows this very well,” Omar told Colbert. “Women has been told to go slow and not be seen and not be heard for many years. And she wouldn’t have made it to where she is if he did. And it’s certainly the case for minority women, and the three of us are minorities and people of color. We are not there to be quiet. We are not there to be invisible.”
Omar raised a firestorm of controversy earlier this year because many interpreted comments critical of Israel as anti-Semitic.

Then, just this week, she was under fire again–this time for remarks she made at a fundraiser for a Muslim organization where she described the attacks of Sept 11, 2001, as “something” done by “some people.”
Talking to Colbert, the lawmaker said she’s in Congress to make “trouble.”
“We are there to follow the lead of people like Congressman John Lewis and make good trouble,” she said, referring to Lewis who was a hero of the civil rights movement before joining Congress.
Here’s an excerpt from the exchange:
COLBERT: “She— she said that you should have apologized. She asked you to apologize. She and other members of both the Republican and the Democratic Party have said to new members, you, Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a lot of new, outspoken quite noted new members of Congress, to basically slow down, don’t do too much, backbench it, see how everything works, you know, find out where the bathrooms are and, you know, and where the copy machine is before you start making waves. What do you say to those people who say, ‘Go slow’?”
OMAR: “Ah, I think Nancy knows this very well. Women has been told to go slow and not be seen and not be heard for many years. And she wouldn’t have made it to where she is if he did. And it’s certainly the case for minority women, and the three of us are minorities and people of color. We are not there to be quiet. We are not there to be invisible. (Cheering and Applause) We — we are there to follow the lead of people like Congressman John Lewis and make good trouble.”
COLBERT: “Well, thank you for being here.”

499,"For Spying Allegation, AG Barr Should Trade ‘His Tortoise Shell Glasses for a Tinfoil Hat’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/for-spying-allegation-ag-barr-should-trade-his-tortoise-shell-glasses-for-a-tinfoil-hat/,"Attorney General William “Bill” Barr ignited a new firestorm in Washington, when he raised a long-debunked conspiracy theory–without evidence–that the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Barr dropped his political bombshell in an exchange with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) during a Senate hearing on the Justice Department budget.
“I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” Barr told Shaheen. “I think spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur. But the question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated.
“The generation I grew up in which is Vietnam War period, people were all concerned about spying on anti-war people and so forth by the government and there were a lot of rules put in place to make sure there’s an adequate basis before our law enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance,” Barr continued. “I’m not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it’s important to look at that. And I’m not talking about the FBI necessarily, but intelligence agencies more broadly.”
Reaction to Barr’s suggestion of spying without evidence was fierce and immediate.

“What I know is that Barr threw out this bombshell, and at the same time refused to present any evidence of it. That is, in my view, reckless and clearly political, especially given the fact the president has been urging him to do this and now is celebrating the fact that he did,” said Sen Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.).
“And it obviously took away a lot of attention from the fact that Mueller has continued to stall in making the — excuse me, the Attorney General has stalled in making the Mueller Report public,” Van Hollen added, referring to the report special counsel Robert Mueller prepared at the end of his Investigation into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. “And has refused to explain the basis for his ‘exonerating’ the president when Mueller expressly did not do so.”
Others wondered why Barr would raise an issue which could tarnish what, up until now, has been a sterling one.
“It was a shame, I think, to see Bill Barr, one of our nation’s most respected lawyers, a two-time attorney general, turn in his tortoise shell glasses for a tinfoil hat,” said Ron Klain, who served as chief of staff to former vice presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden. “What he was talking about was really the craziest Trump conspiracy theories that are out there. That only the president’s most fringe allies dare to advance. Now, what we know is that this has been investigated five times previously by Republican-led committees and nothing came of it.”
Cynthia Alksne, a long-time federal prosecutor and now an MSNBC legal analyst noted that “obviously, Barr feels the need to curry favor with Trump and I don’t understand why a man of his standing and reputation would feel the need to kowtow to the president in such a way.”
The normally non-partisan and analytical MSNBC host Chuck Todd was so outraged by Barr’s statement, he delivered an on-air diatribe.

“Using the word spying plays right into the president’s language and argument that the Russia investigation to him is just a witch hunt. And every time they’ve brought up this allegation, there has been zero factual basis for it,” Todd said. “Every effort to perpetrate the spying conspiracy theory has been debunked. I’ll get to that in a moment. Barr even said later in the hearing that he has no specific evidence about wrongdoing at the Justice Department. But you don’t get to put the toothpaste back into the tube now, do you?
“And if Barr’s assertion today sounds familiar, maybe because President Trump was making the same accusation literally as the attorney general was testifying before Congress,” Todd added.

500,Bernie Sanders Says No To Open Borders,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/bernie-sanders-says-no-to-open-borders/,"Although Donald Trump and other Republicans regularly claim Democrats and progressives only support “open borders,” Sen. Bernie Sanders debunked that notion.
Trump and his supporters regularly articulate a false choice between agreement with Trump’s hardline, often brutal, immigration policies or “open borders.”
Not true, says Sanders, the Vermont independent and self-described democratic socialist, making his second run at the Democratic presidential nomination.
Sanders is one of a large and growing field of more than 15 hopefuls seeking the nomination to take on Trump next year in the general election.

Asked recently by a reporter about open borders, Sanders replied, “I think what we need is comprehensive immigration reform. That is not simply — you’re quite right. If your point is open the borders, you know, there’s a lot of poverty in this world, and you’re going to have people from all over the world [want to immigrate to the United States.] And I don’t think that’s something that we can do at this point. Can’t do it. So that is not my position.”

501,"Long-time, Bipartisan WH Adviser Says Trump Improving Re-election Chances",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/long-time-bipartisan-wh-adviser-says-trump-improving-re-election-chances/,"Donald Trump’s re-election chances are improving, according to David Gergen, who served as a White House adviser for both Republican and Democratic presidents.
“Despite these outrages about the border, his prospects for winning reelection appear to be improving,” said Gergen, who served presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.
“As you sort through the Democratic candidates and what kind of challenges they made, you look for who can be standing up here on the stage, who is as tough as he is, it’s not so clear that his opponents are up to this,” Gergen said.

The state of the economy heading into the election will have much to do with Trump’s electoral future.

“And it’s also clear that if he has the economy he thinks he’s going to have his prospects are going to be high,” he added. “There was a Wall Street Journal poll that captured my attention, it was among Wall Street analysts, 70 percent said they think he’s going to win reelection. Therefore saying a good economy will put him in.”

502,Trump’s Day of Border Fury Probably Backfired,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trumps-day-of-border-fury-probably-backfired/,"Donald Trump began the week with an intention to take fresh action and take an even more aggressive stance on his signature issue of border security with what appeared to be a top-to- bottom housecleaning of political border security officials.
Just a day or two later, Trump found himself under attack from Democrats and Republicans alike–while late-night comedians and others used the occasion to remind Americans of Trump’s cruel and inhumane family separation policy at the border.
In fact, there was some reported evidence that Trump’s goal with his personnel purge was specifically to “reboot” the family separation policy, but under the intense scrutiny of the past days he had to backpedal.
The focal point of the whole mess, of course, was the forced resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
“Oh, well, look at that — Kirstjen Nielsen, the woman responsible for Trump’s border enforcement has been deported out of the White House. Boo-hoo, boo-hoo,” quipped Daily Show host Trevor Noah.

“You know what makes it worse? Not that she just lost this job, Nielsen is leaving the White House with her reputation in tatters. Remember, she was the face of the Trump administration’s family separation policy where kids were slipped from parents and kept in cages. Basically the only job she can get now is working with R. Kelly,” Noah joked, referring to the former hip hop star accused of mountains of sexual assault and misconduct allegations.
Except this was no laughing matter in Washington.
Trump also jettisoned a nominee for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying that he was going “in a tougher direction,” as well as the chief of the Secret Service.
It came to the point where the most senior Senate Republican, Charles Grassley of Iowa, had to step in and warn Trump to refrain from dismissing any other Homeland officials.
“Let me be clear, President Trump is to blame for making the situation at the border worse. His terrible and cruel policies have broken families apart and have caused chaos in our immigration system. This is now self-evident,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.
“This could not come at a worse time for the day to day management of the Department of Homeland Security and the over 220,000 employees that need leadership in order to best help keep the country secure,” Thompson added. “There is now currently no permanent secretary nor deputy secretary at the department. The department will quickly need proven, Senate-confirmed leaders in place that can work with Congress in good faith to help keep the country safe and to fix the Trump-inflicted situation at the border.”
Trump’s frustration with Nielsen, and others, stems from his frustration that he orders them to take steps to stem immigration which would break the law, according to Jake Tapper of CNN.

“Conflicts with Nielsen had been building for months, but had escalated in recent weeks, for instance, two Thursdays ago when a meeting at the Oval Office with the president and other top officials, including Secretary Nielsen, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, top aides Jared Kushner, Mercedes Schlapp and Dan Scavino, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and more. The president, according to one attendee, was ‘ranting and raving,’ saying border security was his issue,” Tapper reported.
“Senior administration officials tell me that President Trump then ordered Nielsen and Pompeo to shut down the port of El Paso, Texas, by the next day, Friday, March 22nd, at noon. The plan was that in subsequent days, the Trump administration would then shut down other ports,” Tapper added. “Nielsen, at the meeting, told the president that would be a bad–and even a dangerous–idea, according to attendees, not to mention, she said, that the governor of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, has been very supportive of the president.”
NeverTrumper Republican Ana Navarro, a CNN political commentator, said that his staff is simply a reflection of Trump’s shortcomings.
“Look, the bottom line is you’re not going to be able to get great people unless you have a great leader. And every single case I have ever been exposed to, the staff is a very accurate reflect of the leader, of the principal,” Navarro said.
“In this case, when the leader is Donald Trump that wants to be surrounded by yes men and yes women, who wants to be told he’s right about everything and wants to be legitimized and validated even though he is ignorant and has no idea what he is doing, then no, you’ll never be able to find a talented group of people because his only loyalty test–his only qualification–is: Will they do and say as he wants them to do and say? That’s a narcissistic strongman lacking the ability to hear other voices and opinions and to know that sometimes he doesn’t know what he doesn’t know,” she added.

503,The Weapon Used to Wage War on Americans,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-weapon-used-to-wage-war-on-americans/,"What if there was a device, kind of like a big flashlight, that you could shine on people, bathing them in its radiation, making them stop in their tracks, open up their minds, and hang on your every word?  What if, after a while, people’s minds become open to you and then you can drop a little message in there without them realizing it’s even happening? Whoa yeah!  This device would be a marketing person’s dream, wouldn’t it? Certainly, it would be a must have for a politician.
The device has its little side effects and restrictions. It only affects half of the people. The message you are allowed to implant in a person’s mind can only be one sentence of no more than five or six words, maybe 10 syllables max. The message often sounds ridiculous without first bathing people in the radiation of the device for a little while.  It does take a little touch, a little finesse to use it effectively.  Oh, and turn the device’s settings up too high and it destroys people’s souls, but hey, this is politics!
What if one could use this device in front of television cameras and have it shine right through into living rooms? Yeah, well, its much more effective if one is physically present at, say, a political rally but it actually does work through the television.  The device has a cumulative effect.

Donald Trump has one.  
Donald Trump is a man with the device and he knows how to use it.  Of course, Trump being Trump, he always keeps it set on full power.
What I am going to do here is shine the device on you and implant Trump’s message, but I have to do it through prose.  So this is more what’s it’s like to experience it.  This is not the whole enchilada mind you but it will give you the idea. If I do this right half of you, dear readers, will have one reaction and half of you will have another. 
By the way, I am serious about this.  The device that I will use has a name that consists of one word, but it must never be said. It is no accident that this word harkens to the most primal feelings of any human being or animal.
If you guess the word that names the device then it won’t have an effect on you. In fact, the device will just piss you off when you know its name. It’s why I am always so pissed off. At the end of this, I will tell you the word; I promise.  One more thing, it works better if the device is shared among multiple people each pointing it at the audience.  It’s a part of the finesse needed to use it.
So here goes, I am flipping on the switch and pointing the device at you.

You hear, “We have a crisis at our borders.”
You can’t feel the radiation yet. The device is just switched on now. It takes it a little while to work.  Oh, and that is not the message to be remembered. No no, those words are a kind of ether, that carries the radiation of the device.  It’s just warming up. Let’s go on maybe you will start feeling the radiation soon.
I hand the device to a man sitting in the audience.  Of course, I secretly put him there. He acts very excited and concerned and shines the device on the crowd.
You hear, “We have a problem in this country and its called Mexican immigrants.”
I take the device and point it at the crowd.
You hear, “Yes, this is an important problem. And its one that will cost many lives.”
I give the device back to the man and he points it at the crowd.
You hear, “Sir, when can we get rid of them?”
Crowd: Roaring approval
Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a bigot to feel the glow; to open your mind to the coming message. Now that your mind is open, that is if it is going to open to the message, I will deliver the message using the device and the ether.  I point the device at the crowd.
You hear, “We are going to be looking at a lot of different things.”
Remember those words are the ether which medium that carries the message.  What is the message that I want so badly to implant in your mind?  Have you guessed it? Ok, I will tell you.
The message coded in the ether is, “I am going to protect you.”

Do you see that?  The ether contains an action. I protect you is the short powerful message that has been slipped into your brain.
Yeah, bigotry against anyone is bad, but that is not what Trump cares about. It’s much more important to Trump that people feel he will protect them. That’s the message that he really cares about. That’s the message he chose to use with the device.  It could have been a different message to buy a certain toothpaste but on this occasion, it was a message about Trump taking actions to protect you.
Oh, did you think bigot was the one word? No, not bigotry, not hatred, not racism.  Those are important power words but they do not stop the device from working. No. Those words describe the ether on this particular occasion.  Bigotry is not necessary for the device to work although it helps.  No there is a deeper word that is the one true name of the device itself. The weapon! A power word, the name of an ancient enemy.
Before I tell you the word of power that keeps the message out of your brain you need to know that the ether could have been something besides Muslims, it could have been religion, blacks, immigrants, Mexicans, guns, LGBTQ, ring around the collar.  There is any number of subjects that would work.  That’s why it’s important not to get stuck on the ether.
The word of power that describes the device is fear.  Once you learn to recognize it when it is turned on you, you will be resistant and you will be free.

504,Debunking The Meme: Pete Buttigieg,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/debunking-the-meme-pete-buttigieg/,"Ezra Klein and Nate Silver are two of the smartest politicos in the business, and despite some big miscalculations in the past, they don’t get much wrong. So, it’s rare when they both get the same thing wrong from different perspectives. Nate sees low amounts of coverage, leading to low poll numbers, while Ezra is seeing low poll numbers that don’t add up with all the coverage he perceives Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg to be receiving.
What neither recognizes is some brilliant media strategy being flawlessly executed by Lis Smith and Team Pete. Let’s break it down.
Early Primary Strategy
It’s April 2019, about a year and seven months away from election day. We haven’t seen a single debate, a single TV or radio campaign ad, and Super Tuesday is 11 months away. There’s nothing to win, yet. According to a Bold Blue Campaigns poll taken in February, roughly 48 percent of Democrats are undecided on who they will vote for in the primaries. (Full disclosure, I’m the chief media strategist for Bold Blue Campaigns).
So, today’s polls are about one thing and one thing only — raising money. Conventional wisdom in primary politics is that the candidates who do well in the early polls raise the early money. But Pete is confounding those expectations, raising $7 million in March against single-digit percentages in the polls, primarily from low dollar donors. So, who is giving Pete all this money? The answer is in the ratings.

Pete’s Media Coverage
Pete is doing more traditional talk shows, like The Tonight Show and The View, and is being covered less on cable news outlets. The entertainment-oriented talk shows get much higher ratings, which means more eyeballs. So, in terms of network minutes of coverage, all the other candidates are being covered far more than Pete by traditional news outlets, but Pete’s on talk shows where most political candidates can’t even get in the door. The difference in ratings between those two sectors is palpable.
For instance, Bill Maher’s Real Time on HBO averages a 7.5 rating, equating to about 8.9 million viewers. CNN’s average daypart viewership is less than 1 million viewers. Pete would need to be on CNN 9 times in order to get viewer numbers in the range of one spot on Real Time — and even if he did get that heavy rotation, he’d likely just be reaching the same viewers 9 times.
Further, in 2018, ABC’s The View finished the 2017-18 TV season with an average of 2.9 million viewers, making it the show’s most-watched year since Barbara Walters said goodbye four years ago. Pete’s been there twice. He’s also been on Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show twice, and that show finished 2018 with an average viewership of 3.67 million nightly viewers, according to The Hollywood Reporter, through December 15. That tops The Tonight Show‘s 2.46 million (where Pete has also guested), giving The Late Show a lead of 1.21 million. That marks an increase over the lead of 980,000 viewers that Colbert held at the same time last year.
Now, let’s look at how cable news stacks up. CNN was one of basic cable’s 10-most-watched networks for 2018, coming in at No. 7. with an average of 706,000 viewers across the 24-hour day (6 a.m. – 6 a.m.), per live-plus-same-day data from Nielsen.
On the downside, that 706,000 viewers figure is -9 percent from what the network drew in the 24-hour daypart in 2017 (779,000). Here’s the rundown for 2018 ratings:

Prime time:
CNN: 988,000 total viewers (-6 percent); 323,000 A25-54 (-12 percent)
MSNBC: 1,802,000 total viewers (+10 percent); 352,000 A25-54 (-5 percent)
Fox News: 2,434,000 total viewers (+1 percent) ;  463,000 A25-54 (-5 percent)
Total Day:
CNN: 706,000 total viewers (-9 percent); 214,000 A25-54 (-16 percent)
MSNBC: 994,000 total viewers (+12 percent);  197,000 A25-54 (-3 percent)
Fox News: 1,425,000 total viewers (-5 percent);  282,000 A25-54 (-12 percent)
Social Media Impact

But it’s not just ratings — it’s about the Internet and social media. When Jimmy Fallon posts a video interview, he has more than 50 million Twitter followers who get it on their feeds. Stephen Colbert has more than 18 million Twitter followers. By comparison, Chris Cuomo at CNN has fewer than 2 million followers. As a consequence, Pete registered a 35 percent spike in his Google searches as of April 1, outpaced only by Joe Biden, whose Google searches increased as a result of Lucy Flores’ initial allegation of Biden kissing her inappropriately. From The Hill:
Breaking down the search interest, Biden saw a 100 percent increase in the past week, while Buttigieg saw a spike of 35 percent and Bernie Sanders saw an increase of 18 percent.
Biden is widely expected to announce a 2020 presidential run, joining a field of more than a dozen Democratic candidates.
Several candidates saw interest spike concurrent with their campaign announcements, including Kamala Harris, who saw her peak around Jan. 21, when she made her announcement, and Sanders, who saw a similar peak when he announced on Feb. 19.
So, by Nate’s measure, the minutes of airtime don’t add up for Pete, but the number of people he’s reaching per minute of airtime — and on social media — would make most campaign managers drool uncontrollably. What is it that your boss always tells you to do that makes you want to feed his head into the fax machine? Work smarter, not harder. Well, Pete’s doing both, and he’s making it look effortless.
Why don’t the polls match the ratings?
Entertainment broadcast venues and broadcast news venues capture different viewerships in terms of demographics and voting records. In fact, the people who watch cable news tend to be likely voters, the people most pollsters call, because they pull names and numbers from the rolls of registered Democrats.
People who watch entertainment talk shows are a cross-section of a variety of demographics in America, where barely 40 percent could be considered likely voters. That means the majority of the people watching those talk shows, at least 60 percent of them, aren’t getting phone calls from pollsters. Why? Because they are either unregistered, or they simply haven’t voted in a while, so their names never show up on a pollster’s call list.

And that’s the answer to all the questions that neither Ezra nor Nate can seem to isolate within the confines of their tweets. Unlikely voters, new voters, people who can’t stand politics and haven’t participated recently all seem to love Pete. If he’s only polling at 3 percent, then we know those people aren’t enough to get him the money he raised last month. So, it must have come from the unlikely voters not represented in the polls — and they are the ones who first met Pete because of Jimmy or Stephen or Whoopi.
And as long as he continues to deliver them ratings, they’ll keep booking him, leaving candidates like Sanders, Warren, Biden, and Cory Booker on the outside looking in, unless they can pull some strings and get into the studio audience.

505,Trump: ‘I Want To Be Two For Two’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-i-want-to-be-two-for-two/,"Donald Trump pumped up his fellow Republicans for the coming 2020 election–while also mocking the deal that the Obama administration negotiated in cooperation with several US allies to release frozen Iranian assets in exchange for a verifiable end to Iranian nuclear weapons development.
Trump has since taken steps to end that agreement.
“We are going win. By the way, one of the people that was confirmed by somebody else today on the other side, Democrat, we are saying that they would reinstitute — reinstate the Iran nuclear deal. Well, this is what you have. They want to reinstate the deal. It was a disaster for our country,” Trump said, speaking to a Jewish Republican Coalition gathering in Las Vegas, Nev. “We gave $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash, what does that look like? Airplanes loaded up with cash, how stupid was that deal? They want to reinstate it.

“Republicans are going to win the White House, we are going to retake the House, we are going keep the Senate and we are once again going to be in a position, in my opinion, like never ever before, stronger than we’ve ever been before.
“There is more spirit for the Republican Party right now than I’ve ever seen. They keep talking about the spirit of the Democrat party. There’s more spirit for Republicans in my opinion by far–we may express somewhat differently and that’s okay–more spirit than I have ever seen and I’ve now been doing this for a little while,” Trump enthused. “Not too long. I’m one for one. One for one. I want to be two for two and then we relax.”

506,Fmr. Obama Adviser: Dems Have The Big Tent Now,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/fmr-obama-adviser-dems-have-the-big-tent-now/,"Democrats today can boast of being the political party with the “big tent,” according to Valerie Jarrett, a former adviser in President Barack Obama’s White House.
Jarrett made her remarks in the context of advice for, and summing up, the field of Democratic candidates for president. At well more than a dozen and growing, that field of hopefuls is quite sizeable, and all are trying to make their mark with voters.
“First of all, I think it’s important that the candidates, and I said this to all those who asked for my opinion, make an affirmative case about what they stand for,” she said during an interview with the Rev. Al Sharpton. “Be honest and authentic, and really say: ‘This is where I’m coming from, this is my expertise, and this is how I’m sure I can execute my vision,’ and earn the trust of the American people based on their vision, not criticizing somebody else, but what do you believe in?
“And the other thing I would say is, look, one of the advantages of the Democratic Party is we have a big tent, lots of ideas. They are all welcome. We are not polarizing. We’re trying to bring everybody in,” Jarrett added.

More than a generation ago, it was President Ronald Reagan and the Republicans of the time who claimed the “big tent” mantle.
However, under Trump, the GOP has become much more homogeneous while the Democrats can claim Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on the left of the party, and Sen Joe Manchin of West Virginia–who supported a number of Trump appointees–on the other side.
And in Washington, policymakers have to learn to compromise again, said Jarrett, who served as a close adviser and confidant for the full eight years of the Obama administration.
“It cannot be a dirty word. You got to figure out how to not let perfect be the enemy of the good or you won’t get anything done,” she said. “So figuring out how to reach out to the other side of the aisle and seeing if there’s room for compromise, and that doesn’t mean walk away from your ideals and values. But you do try to look common ground.”
Jarrett doesn’t see the large size of the 2020 field of Democratic contenders as a negative.
“We have an embarrassment of riches,” she said. “There are terrific candidates out there and I want them to stay optimistic and describe how they want to serve our country and how they’re going to look out for the American people.”

507,The Uphill Battle to Reform U.S. Health Care,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-uphill-battle-to-reform-u-s-health-care/,"The private medical industry is serving a market that does not behave with normal elasticity. What does that mean? It means that the laws of supply and demand don’t work the same way they do in a normal marketplace.
People don’t say to themselves, “Gee, medical care is really cheap right now, I think I will get sick.”
Conversely, people don’t say, “Gee, medical care is really expensive right now, I won’t get sick.”
Also, people don’t say while they are in the ambulance being rushed to the hospital, “Take me to the cheaper emergency room in another town.”
There are, in the US, a large number of people who cannot afford to use medical care at all.  So they show up at the ER when a baby has a high temperature instead of calling a pediatrician.  For many Americans, the first doctor who treats their failing heart is an ER doctor because that person cannot afford to pay doctors in clinics.  The ER has to help, by law, and then gets stiffed by people who can’t pay.

Those examples are breaking what a marketplace is supposed to be about. There is no elasticity.  People get sick when they get sick.
By the way, I remember my one ride in an ambulance as “I hope I get there before I die. I hope I get there before I die. I hope I …” I didn’t know where there was and didn’t care.
Another interesting facet of the medical marketplace is that science has created treatments that are very expensive. These very expensive, life-saving treatments are uncommon and less than 1% of Americans can afford to pay for.
This is why, in other countries, the governments have stepped in and either completely nationalized health care, or made a single payer system in which everyone pays for everyone’s health care. Healthy people balance the unhealthy. People who can pay balance those who can’t. Costs are balanced out and their excellent health care systems cost less than half per patient than US health care and yet they provide the expensive treatments at higher success rates than in the US.
Want the highest survival rate from heart surgery? Better to have a heart attack in Australia, mate. Want a better chance of survival of colon cancer? Europe is a good place but Mexico is fine too. Mexico is a top health tourism place.
Why does the United States spend double per patient for worse outcomes than other countries with really good health care?
The most important thing to remember about health care in any country is, that at any given moment there is a lot of money floating around in the system. Health care is big business anywhere and wouldn’t it be nice if that money could just run through the hands of a few select financial institutions if it is going to be in the health care system anyway?

Think of it as an interest-bearing checking account which, at any moment in time, has trillions of dollars in it. Understanding this is all you need to know as to why the US health care system has private insurance.
By the way, this isn’t just any trillion dollar, interest-bearing, checking account. The investment of that trillion dollars in the financial world is managed by people who squeeze every last penny out of it. Of course, it’s not really an interest-bearing checking account we are talking about here; it’s really a hedge fund.
Internally, the insurance industry refers to the hedge fund as float on premiums. It is the job of health insurance companies to make sure that the balance in their hedge fund is constant and predictable such that the investment bank can maximize profit from the fund. That is the one and the only job of an insurance company, any insurance company. The longer the float, the more money that can be earned on it.
Since the one and only job of any health care company is to maximize float, your health care insurance company is focused on that like a laser. The idea that insurance companies are motivated to cut costs is a howler of a lie. Higher premiums equal more float!  Yes, just the opposite is true of cost-cutting. Anything to get the premiums up is welcome. Anything to slow down the outflows from the hedge fund to pay doctors is welcome. What the health industry wants, therefore, are high premiums that are distributed to doctors as slowly as possible.

This brings us to how doctors are paid. In order to maximize the time of money floating in their hedge fund, insurance companies pay doctors for procedures. They pay for cancer treatment, they pay for vasectomies, they pay for heart treatments. They don’t want to pay for preventative care because actuaries have determined that shortens the time money is in the float. Insurance companies would rather pay big payments less very often.
A person with a preexisting condition statistically shortens the float. That’s why private insurance would prefer not to have to give them insurance.
Unfortunately, with all of the financial industry benefitting from private insurance premiums, it will be an uphill battle changing the fiasco that is U.S. health care.
I will point out, though, that other countries’ governments seem to be able to make health care work, whether it is socialized or single payer.  Some countries do health care spectacularly well.  Japan has excellent health care for a large population with a single payer system that serves private doctors.  Canada has a single payer system which was rated low, not low like the United States but fairly low because of long wait times for a doctor. Now, Canada has completely turned that around and now rates very high in the WHO rankings. Waiting for a doctor in Canada is no longer an issue.  So yes, it can be done.
It’s just that U.S. politicians can’t do it.

508,Why America Hasn’t Had Another Moon Landing,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/why-america-hasnt-had-another-moon-landing/,"It was 50 years ago when an American test pilot, Joseph A. Walker flew his hypersonic aircraft, the X-15, at nearly Mach 6 into space, becoming weightless for five minutes. Walker had already earned his astronaut’s wings on two other flights. In fact, eight pilots in all would fly this aircraft into space, becoming astronauts and then landing on a runway.
This was in the 1960s when going to the moon was not impossible. Today, the country that sent people to the moon in 1969 has to pay the Russians to take them into space. The country where pilots rode hypersonic aircraft into space in 1962 is behind both Russia and China in hypersonic technology.
A country that built the A-12, a Mach 3 fighter that fired a hypersonic missile in 1962 does not have hypersonic weapons today, nor does it have a single stage to orbit aircraft. What happened? Why is the US about to put people on the end of a giant fuel-air bomb, light it up and call that space transportation?
No offense, SpaceX and ULA, but your technology is old news. The technology in the hands of the US government during the 1960s far exceeds that of Virgin Galactic. Virgin Galactic is doing something similar to the X-15 except without the hypersonic speeds. The only reason SpaceX, ULA, and Virgin Galactic are around trying to reinvent legacy technology is that someone dropped the ball.

That ball dropper is the U.S. Congress and the President. Consider that we had the Clinton Mars Initiative canceled and replaced with the Bush Moon Initiative, which was canceled and replaced with the Obama Mars Initiative, which was also canceled and replaced with the Trump Moon Initiative.
This is not political leadership; it is sabotage! It is this kind of leadership that had the US building technology it used in the 1950s. Yes, rockets and rocket planes are being updated, but this is nothing revolutionary. Revolutionary aerospace technology is so 1950s.
Big technology projects in an age when Congress replaces budgets with stop-gap spending bills are nearly impossible. Presidents who cannot provide the leadership required to get a job done cannot lead the United States into a century where the transcendent threat is global warming.
If we can’t utilize the technology we already have, how are we going to meet the challenge of stopping global warming? At the moment when the world needs US geopolitical and technological leadership, no one is home. No one has been home for a long time.
The real problem? The people up in Washington.

509,"As AG Holds Back Mueller Report, Dems Claim ‘Cover-up’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/as-ag-holds-back-mueller-report-dems-claim-cover-up/,"The longer Attorney General William “Bill” Barr holds back the full Mueller Report, the louder Democrats have begun to claim a cover-up.
Special counsel Robert Mueller last month completed his two-year investigation into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, to tilt the 2016 presidential election to Trump–and any subsequent obstruction of justice.
When he completed his investigation, Mueller turned in a sealed report numbering in the hundreds of pages.
Almost immediately after Mueller submitted his report, Barr released a four-page summary which quotes very little of the Mueller Report itself.
The Barr summary essentially took any criminal onus off of Trump.
Word began to leak that the Mueller team is not happy with the Barr summary. They reportedly created their own unclassified summaries for release to the public, and they were not. Moreover, the report paints a more serious picture for Trump than what Barr has portrayed.

Congressional Democrats are demanding the immediate release of the full Mueller Report.
“Every day that goes by without the American people getting the actual report … is indicative of a cover-up,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). “The fact of the matter is, all people have gotten out of the 400 pages is something less than 100 words. That’s not acceptable. And as a member of the [Senate] Intelligence Committee, I can read documents. I’d be going through any redactions if something was necessary to protect national security. But it is time for the American people to get the facts and not get less than 100 words.”
The House Judiciary Committee has approved a subpoena for full, unredacted Mueller Report as well as the underlying evidence, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) noted.
“You have a president who started off by saying, ‘Sure, let’s make it public.’ The House that voted unanimously to make it all public and suddenly there is all this, ‘The four-page letter is good enough.’ What are they trying to hide? If I were the president and thought I was exonerated, I would want everything to be laid out for the public. That’s what he said. Now they are backing off that. They are hiding the ball. What’s going on? That’s why the report has to be made public.”

510,"Trump’s Border Hardline Correct, Ex-Starbucks Chief Says",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trumps-border-hardline-correct-ex-starbucks-chief-says/,"While he is ostensibly supposed to be considering an independent bid to deny Donald Trump a second term, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has endorsed one of Trump’s most controversial and signature policies.
Schultz said he endorses the hard line Trump is taking with the southern border.
“Now, the issue that we have to recognize is this: President Trump is correct, and the Republican leadership is correct that we need fierce, strict levels of control on that border … in illegal immigrants should not come in,” said Schultz, who served separate stints as CEO and chairman of the popular coffee chain.
“I don’t want to get into a wall or anything but I agree we should fund whatever we need to do to secure the border. I get that,” Schultz added, referring to Trump’s desire to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico.

“Now, the humanity issue — one more thing. The Democrats are not correct,” Schultz said, in apparent reference to those Democrats who have called for de-funding or reforming Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
“We should be funding ICE and give them all the tools and resources they need to secure the borders and arrest the bad people. Whatever they need, give them all the resources.”
Schultz has said that he would run a centrist independent campaign, but Democrats complain that a Schultz candidacy would just split the vote and help Trump win a second term.
During his appearance in an on-air town hall broadcast on Fox News, Schultz also addressed the recent spate of accusations of inappropriate contact between women and former vice president Joe Biden, as Biden may himself join the race for the White House.

“Well, what I would say is that there is no reason for anyone to believe that these women are not telling the truth. But it’s really up to the voters whether or not vice president Biden is qualified to run. I think this kind of behavior certainly is inconsistent with how to behave and how to respect women, and it’s concerning,” Schultz said. “However, vice president Biden has served the country for 40 years. Has been vice president for eight years.
“The only thing I would ask is one question. Why is this coming up now? I’m not questioning the women on any level, but it’s concerning to me that all of a sudden, on the eve of whether he was going to announce or not, this is all of a sudden coming up. It’s concerning,” he added.

511,House To Go to Court To Block ‘The Wall’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/house-to-go-to-court-to-block-the-wall/,"Its vote to override Donald Trump’s veto unsuccessful, the Democratic-controlled House is now turning to the courts to block Trump’s plans to build a wall along the southern border of the United States.
The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group within the House voted this week to authorize taking legal action to block Trump’s wall.
Both House and Senate passed a resolution of disapproval which would have put a stop to Trump’s declaration of a “state of emergency,” which Trump invoked essentially to bypass Congress and raid military budgets to find funding for his long-wanted wall.

But Trump issued the first veto of his presidency to strike down the resolution.
The House, then, last month couldn’t muster the two-thirds supermajority to override Trump’s veto.
That led to this week’s vote of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group. The group, made up of members of the House leadership–the speaker, the majority and minority leaders, and the majority and minority whips–it directs the activities of the House Office of General Counsel to involve itself in litigation.
“The president’s sham emergency declaration and unlawful transfers of funds have undermined our democracy, contravening the vote of the bipartisan Congress, the will of the American people and the letter of the Constitution,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“The president’s action clearly violates the Appropriations Clause by stealing from appropriated funds, an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority,” she added. “Congress, as Article I – the first branch, co-equal to the other branches – must reassert its exclusive responsibilities reserved by the text of the Constitution and protect our system of checks and balances.”
The House lawsuit will join a number of others which also seek to put the breaks on Trump’s wall. That includes cases brought on behalf of landowners in Texas, whose properties would be impacted by the wall.

512,Bernie Appears on Fox News To Tell Viewers: Trump Lies to You,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/bernie-appears-on-fox-news-to-tell-viewers-trump-lies-to-you/,"Bernie Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, said that he agreed to appear on the Republican-friendly Fox News with a specific goal in mind.
“I think it is important to talk to those people and say, ‘You know what? I know many of you voted for Donald Trump, but he lied to you. He told you, for example, he was going to provide healthcare to all people, now he wants to throw 30 million people off the healthcare that they had. He told you that he was going to give tax reform that would not benefit the wealthy. [But] 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent,” said Sanders, a US senator from Vermont making his second run at the Democratic nomination.
“So I think it is important to talk to Trump supporters and explain to them to what degree he has betrayed the working class of this country and lied during his campaign in terms of what he would do,” added Sanders, who is leading the large field of contenders for the Democratic nomination in reported fundraising.

Pressed on why he hasn’t released tax returns yet, Sanders replied that he would make 10 years’ worth “all public very shortly.”
Sanders challenged Donald Trump to follow suit.
“By the way, I’m delighted to do that, proud to do that. Hey, Mr. Trump, you do the same thing,” Sanders said.

513,Trump Surprisingly Unconcerned About Mar-a-Lago Breach,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-surprisingly-unconcerned-about-mar-a-lago-breach/,"Donald Trump is seemingly unconcerned about a potentially serious breach of security at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
The recent event involved a Chinese woman who entered the resort with more than one passport and a thumb drive containing malicious software.
She was arrested by the Secret Service, but not before penetrating several checkpoints within the compound. Trump was said to have been in the area but not to have come into contact with the woman.
“Well, I saw the story. I haven’t spoken to anybody about it other than I had a brief meeting, gave me a little bit of information. No, I’m not concerned at all,” Trump said after the incident. “I have — we have very good control. We have extremely good [security] and it’s getting better, frankly, what we’re doing with cyber is a story in itself.

“No, I think that was just a fluke situation and I think that the person sitting at the front desk did a very good job, to be honest with you,” Trump added. “I think that particular woman did a very, very good job. She was able to see things that other people were not. But, no, I think it’s just a fluke.”
His statements of satisfaction aside, Trump’s continued ongoing use of the resort as a sort of “southern White House” has been a nagging security issue from the start, as the president leaves it open to paying resort members and guests even when he and his family are in residence.
Concerns trace back to the early days of the Trump administration, when dues-paying members were snapping and posting to social media photos of what was essentially an “open-air situation room” on the grounds. Trump, members of his administration and the prime minister of Japan appeared to be discussing and reviewing material by the light of their cell phones related to a missile test by North Korea.
The administration at the time insisted that those members of the public never came in contact with classified material.

514,Congress Has ‘Right’ to Trump’s Taxes,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/congress-has-right-to-trumps-taxes/,"Despite Donald Trump’s protests to the contrary, Congress is on absolutely firm legal ground to obtain Trump’s past tax returns, according to a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who wrote a 2016 biography of Trump.
Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has made clear that he plans to access Trump’s tax information through the Internal Revenue Service.
Although presidential candidates from both parties have, for decades, released their tax returns for public review Trump refused to do so.
Asked about the House Democrats’ intention to obtain six years of his tax information and make it public, Trump said, “We’re under audit despite what people said and we’re working that out as — I’m always under audit, it seems, but I’ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big and I guess when you have a name, you are audited. But until such time as I’m not under audit, I would not be inclined to do that.”
When he testified in a public session of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in February, former Trump attorney and fixer Michael Cohen challenged Trump’s claims that his taxes are under audit.
Rather, Trump wants to keep his taxes hidden so that tax experts won’t see them and suggest that he be subject to higher taxes and penalties, according to Cohen.
Regardless, Trump’s objection likely sets up a court fight. But in the end, Democrats clearly have the law on their side, said David Cay Johnston, author of the biography The Making of Donald Trump.
“Under a 1924 anti-corruption law, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee or the employee of Congress who is the chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation all have a right to see this,” he said. “The law says the Treasury secretary shall produce not just the tax return but any tax return information. That means if they have copies of the books and records of Donald Trump’s companies, transaction records, audit notes, audit notices, many other things … “

515,Joe Biden and the Sad State of Democrats’ Crisis Communications,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/joe-biden-and-the-sad-state-of-democrats-crisis-communications/,"The national media seems consumed with questions about whether former vice president Joe Biden is too “handsy” to be a viable presidential candidate in the age of #MeToo, but Democrats should be equally as concerned about one reality that they don’t seem to recognize — they have absolutely no earthly clue how to manage crisis communications in today’s political climate.
Of course, many argue that the primary difference between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to these issues is that Democrats seem stymied by questions of character with regard to racism, misogyny and consent culture while Republicans easily excuse white supremacy and sexual assault because they cling to some imaginary moral high ground regarding abortion. As if the GOP’s constant fascination with what we all have in our pants and what we do with it is like they’re a bunch of teenagers who never got over their first case of the high school hornies.
That’s a deeper discussion for another time, because we can’t get to that until we unravel why Democrats always seem so bumfuzzled when it comes to addressing their own questions of character in the court of public opinion. The real problem is the willful ignorance and arrogance of campaign strategists who simply refuse to adhere to the best practices of Crisis Communication 101.

Which brings us to Biden. It’s not like no one knew of his reputation for being a little huggy with women, as the GOP has been portraying him as the creepy uncle who keeps candy in his pockets for the better part of a decade. Moreover, the Democratic party has been a key supporter of the #MeToo movement, so how is it that no one in Biden’s camp came up with any kind of strategy to preempt those concerns with a proactive communications plan? So, for them, we offer a primer of the basic principles we must apply to Democratic candidacies.
Preemptive Diffusion — When you know there is an issue, don’t wait for the opposition to point it out. That means playing defense, and in politics, that never works. Get out in front of it and control the narrative as much as possible. That’s a principle Madison Paige, CEO of Bold Blue Campaigns calls  “preemptive diffusion,” meaning you can prevent the crisis by facilitating the release of embarrassing information in the context of your choosing, winning points with voters for transparency and self-awareness.
In Biden’s case, it’s no secret that the party is concerned about an aging straight white male being the standard bearer of the party of diversity and inclusion. As the story has evolved, he has about as many women defending him as accusing him, so it’s not like he would have been without allies. He could have addressed that overriding concern as well as any future complaints about his past actions with a simple paragraph in his stump speech.

“In this campaign, you’re going to hear stories of me being inappropriately affectionate with women I have encountered in political circles over the years. Now, one of my strengths of my candidacy is my decades of experience, and there is no denying that during my time in politics we have progressed in leaps and bounds in our social consciousness. Modern women’s rights, LGBTQ rights and civil rights movements have opened our eyes to the larger injustices as well as the more nuanced ones, including how men treat women with regard to consent to physical contact.
Looking back, I realize that there are times where I have crossed a line on more than one occasion. I offer no excuses for my behavior, but rather a pledge to sincerely apologize to those I have wronged and to recognize the evolution of a woman’s right to control their physical person. It is at the heart of the Democratic Party’s commitment to change consent culture for the better, and my personal commitment to evolve as a candidate and as a person as we grow more aware of the microaggressions that silently poison the interactions between men and women.”
With one statement, he could have eliminated the GOP’s ability to pound him mercilessly over the current crop of accusations, but more importantly, he could have honored those women who genuinely felt they were powerless to complain about his actions.
But he waited too long. The story got out, first with one accuser and then with four more. Then one of his strategists, speaking to the media,  got into the weeds on one of the accuser’s stories in a bizarre dissection of the he said/she said narrative. That was tantamount to shooting himself in both feet, and then congratulating himself on his good aim. Finally, we wind up with a hastily-shot video of Uncle Joe looking directly into the camera saying he’ll be more careful in the future like an accused DUI suspect before a traffic court judge. And that is the communications strategy from the campaign of the Democratic frontrunner, a virtual definition of the term “bumfuzzled.”

Hire Media Pros — For the love of Alan Dershowitz, politicians need to stop using attorneys and campaign strategists as spokespeople. Lawyers are trained on how to present evidence and make cases within the narrow confines of the court of law. Some evidence, though truthful and compelling, is not admissible, and can be dismissed or ignored. Further, campaign strategists are athletes in the bloodsport of politics, trained to attack and counterattack, which never works with issues of character. The Court of Public Opinion, however, has no rules. A dusty Polaroid dug out of a dumpster is as admissible as an indictment, and when presented properly, can be more damaging. Attorneys also use stunted formal language that makes many of their public statements incomprehensible to their audience, deflating any potential rehabilitative effects they could have on a campaign. In other words, if you’re fighting a lawsuit or criminal charges. If you’re fighting the media, use a media expert. Finally, stop thinking you can do it yourself because you binge-watched Mad Men and West Wing. I watch the Food Network, but that doesn’t make me Gordon Ramsey.
Not to go all Game of Thrones, but Winter is coming. We are in for a political season that would make Sun Tzu sit up and beg like a Lhasa-Poo who smells bacon. Democrats need to saddle up and prepare real crisis communications strategies and tactics that serve to defuse any potential time-bombs while preserving their dignity.

516,"If Trump, Republicans Thought Barr’s Summary Would Satisfy, They Were Mistaken",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/if-trump-republicans-thought-barrs-summary-would-satisfy-they-were-mistaken/,"If Donald Trump and his Republican allies thought Attorney General William “Bill” Barr’s brief summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report would curb public demand to see the full Mueller document, they seriously miscalculated.
Mueller produced a report numbering in the hundreds of pages last month, when he finished his two-year investigation into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign to tilt the 2016 presidential election to Trump–as well as any subsequent obstruction of justice.
Trump touted the Barr summary as “total exoneration,” even though that’s not what either the summary, or underlying Mueller Report, said.
There’s very likely much more to the Mueller Report than either Trump or Barr has represented so far because “it’s never taken me 400 pages to say nothing happened,” said former US attorney Chuck Rosenberg.
“So I imagine something happened, and that something, particularly with respect to obstruction, was quite serious,” Rosenberg added.

Rosenberg said he had a theory as to why Mueller didn’t recommend prosecution or declination on obstruction.
“The Department of Justice has in place policies, one dates to the ‘70s … that say to charge a sitting president would be overly burdensome, it would stigmatize the presidency, so we just don’t charge sitting presidents,” he said.
“With that in mind, even if the obstruction constituted a crime, and it may well have–we don’t know that yet–I can imagine Mueller not making a recommendation because a recommendation to prosecute someone you can’t prosecute is equally burdensome and equally stigmatizing,” Rosenberg concluded.
There is a parade of recent public opinion polls which clearly say that the public is clamoring to see the full Mueller Report.
For instance, by a two-to-one margin, a Washington Post-Schar School Poll found Americans believe Barr has not yet released enough information with his summary. The same poll found a full 83 percent want the Mueller Report released “in its entirety.”
Barr has said that he would heavily redact any release of the Mueller Report that he would make, either to Congress or the public at large.
Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which on Wednesday, voted along party lines to authorize a subpoena for an unredacted copy of the Mueller Report as well as all of the underlying evidence.

“I don’t think there’s any question the law is on our side. There’s clearly a compelling public interest,” Cicilline said prior to Wednesday’s subpoena authorization.
“We have oversight responsibility. There’s precedence for this. We should remember this investigation began because our democracy was attacked by a foreign adversary,” Cicilline added.”This investigation belongs to the American people. They have a right to know the results of this investigation. They have a right to know the truth and the Judiciary Committee has tremendous responsibilities in this area, both to do oversight, to focus on obstruction of justice, corruption, self-dealing. We have tremendous oversight responsibilities.
“And we must see the contents of this report, as a 22-month investigation we fought hard to protect Mr. Mueller so he could complete his work. We didn’t do that so Mr. Barr could keep it a secret from the Judiciary Committee or cherry pick what he thinks we ought to see.”

517,Trump Rival Weld: President Demanding Loyalty Oaths Is ‘Perilously Close’ to Obstruction of Justice,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-rival-weld-president-demanding-loyalty-oaths-is-perilously-close-to-obstruction-of-justice/,"A potential rival against Donald Trump seeking the Republican presidential nomination next year approves of the job Attorney General William Barr is doing with the Mueller Report, but he lambasted Trump himself.
At issue is how much of the report–based on special counsel Robert Mueller’s two-year investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, and subsequent obstruction–Barr will make public.
“Bill Barr is a pretty strong guy. I think April 15th is not an unreasonable deadline,” said former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is looking at challenging Trump next year in the primaries, referring to deadline Barr announced for release of a redacted version of the report. Weld also is a former federal prosecutor. He ran as the 2016 vice presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, before returning to the GOP.

“I think the Justice Department, quite frankly, all the way from Mueller up to [Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein and Barr looks pretty good in this,” Weld added during a recent appearance on MSNBC.
That is where Weld’s kudos end. He slammed Trump for essentially exonerating himself based on the few sentences Barr quoted in a summary he released almost immediately after Mueller submitted his sealed report.
“You know, the president had 25 allegations of potential criminality against him and he was cleared of one of them. I wouldn’t exactly put out a press release highlighting that if I were the president, with all the other matters swirling around him in politicization of the Justice Department, demanding loyalty oaths from law enforcement officials,” Weld added, apparently referring to former FBI director James Comey stating that Trump asked Comey to swear his loyalty to Trump not long after Trump came to office.
“That is perilously close to obstruction of justice, speaking of obstruction of justice,” Weld concluded.
Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee voted Wednesday, along party lines, to authorize a subpoena to compel Barr to release to the committee an unredacted version of the Mueller Report and any underlying evidence.

518,Rep. Nunes: Democrats Want Mueller Report To ‘Continue Pretending There’s Russian Collusion’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/democrats-want-mueller-report-to-continue-pretending-theres-russian-collusion/,"Congressional Democrats are so adamant about obtaining the sealed Mueller Report so they can leak classified material to the news media and continue on with talk of collision with Russia, according to the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee.
The intelligence panel has been in open warfare as its Republican members demand the resignation of the Democratic chairman, as that chairman continues to make accusations of collusion, even after special counsel Robert Mueller concluded his two-year investigation and Attorney General William “Bill” Barr’s four-page letter which removed from Donald Trump any criminal onus.
House Democrats may move forward to attempt to subpoena the full and complete report Mueller submitted at the end of his probe.

“I think the attorney general wants to do anything and everything he can” to provide the Mueller Report, said Rep. Devin Nunes of California, who chaired the intelligence panel until Democrats took the House majority in January. “I think full transparency is in order and I just want to make sure that everyone understands what full transparency means.
“The Democrats on the left here just want to get their hands on the report so — it’ll probably be classified, there will be a lot of classified information in there — so they can leak it to all the bodies in the media, so they can continue on going down rabbit holes of pretending that there is some kind of Russian collusion,” Nunes added during an interview with Fox News.

519,Pelosi Marks Equal Pay Day by Touting Recent House Approval of Paycheck Fairness Act,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/pelosi-marks-equal-pay-day-by-touting-recent-house-approval-of-paycheck-fairness-act/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi observed Equal Pay Day Tuesday by touting the recent passage in the House of Rep. Rosa DeLauro’s Paycheck Fairness Act.
Equal Pay Day marks how far into the year a woman must work, on average, to earn as much as a man earned the previous year.
“Each Equal Pay Day, Americans must renew our solemn commitment to fully and finally securing fairness, equality and economic justice for women,” Pelosi said. “This Equal Pay Day, we are celebrating a major achievement, by marking the passage by the House of H.R. 7, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro’s landmark Paycheck Fairness Act to secure equal pay for equal work. Now, we call upon the U.S. Senate to take up and pass this critical legislation.”

The House passed the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) by a vote of 242-187, including seven Republicans.
The Paycheck Fairness Act would strengthen and close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by holding employers accountable for discriminatory practices, ending the practice of pay secrecy, easing workers’ ability to individually or jointly challenge pay discrimination, and strengthening the available remedies for wronged employees, according to DeLauro’s office.
“I have the utmost confidence in Sen. Patty Murray [D-Wash.], Paycheck Fairness’s Senate champion,” said DeLauro (D-Conn.). “She is a serious legislator, and I could not ask for a better partner in this fight. I urge my Senate colleagues to support this bill, put it on the president’s desk, and make equal pay for women the law of the land.”
A video of DeLauro’s speech from the House floor can be found here.

520,Biden Accuser Would Vote For Him Over Trump, Her Motivation Questioned,The BiPartisan Press,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/biden-accuser-would-vote-for-him-over-trump-her-motivation-questioned/,"The first of two women accusing Joe Biden of inappropriate contact said she would still vote for the former vice president if he were to become the Democratic presidential nominee next year.
A popular female morning news talk host also raised questions about that accuser’s possible motivation for coming forward against Biden now, as he is on the cusp of possibly joining the field of Democrats contending for their party’s nomination.
That first accuser is Lucy Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman who alleges Biden’s inappropriate contact occurred in 2014, when she was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor.
Biden released a statement in which he admits to many tactile gestures of goodwill and support over the years, he never intentionally acted inappropriately. If others feel differently, “I’ll listen respectfully.”
A second woman, Amy Lappos of Connecticut, said Biden’s inappropriate contact with her happened at a fundraiser in 2009.

This scandal broke just as Biden was looking to make the race to take on Donald Trump.
Asked about Biden’s potential candidacy against Trump’s by CBS News, Flores replied, “That’s not even a question. Of course I would support Biden.”
Meanwhile, MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski wondered on-air whether Flores had a political motivation for her accusation, that of hobbling a potential Biden candidacy so as to favor that of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
“A lot of folks will say that women need to be believed and heard, and I believe they should be heard. But are we allowed to bring up that Lucy Flores is a huge Bernie person? And she has political connections that might be counter to Biden’s goals?” Brzezinski said. ” … Is it OK to bring up this could be politically motivated? Or are we just supposed to take all the words and the fact she said she was violated at face value? Are we supposed to just leave it there and have this sort of attack on his credibility and his honor? Just sit there, or are we allowed to talk about it?”

521,"Lawmakers, Others Across Spectrum Say That Closing Border Would Be Wrong",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/lawmakers-others-across-spectrum-say-that-closing-border-is-wrong/,"Lawmakers and others across the political spectrum are expressing worry over Donald Trump’s threat to close the southern border within days over movement of so-called “caravans” of Central American refugees looking to come to the United States.
Among the issues at stake is the future of Trump’s proposed trade agreement to replace NAFTA.
Saying that he was “not playing games,” Trump threatened to close the southern border–including trade–if Mexico did not halt the flow of undocumented immigrants.
“I talked to Democrats and Republicans, they’re also worried that this could exacerbate problems with the USMCA, the trade agreement that they’re trying to finalize that’s already in serious trouble in Congress right now,” said Kelsey Snell, NPR congressional reporter. “They are worried that they’re not going to be able to get the kind of support they need if the President is starting another fight with Mexico. And, you know, there are plenty of people on both sides of the aisle who would really like to get some sort of trade stability happening with both Mexico and Canada.”
Rather than sound belligerent, Trump and his administration should focus more on the humanitarian factors at the border, according to Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.)

“Instead of building fences two or three years in the future by taking money from the Department of Defense, focus on facilities to serve the families so there aren’t children who are hurt and dying as a result of this situation,” Durbin said. “Then look at the big picture. When the president says he’s going to close the border, that is a totally unrealistic best on his part.
“What we need to do is focus on what’s happening in Central America where three countries are disassembling before our eyes and people are coming desperately to the United States. The president’s cutting off aid to these countries will not solve that problem,” Durbin added.
While he said he sympathizes with Trump’s position, former Republican senator and presidential candidate Rick Santorum also believes closing the border would be a mistake.
“I think the idea of closing the border is a bad idea,” Santorum said. “I understand why the president is doing it. He’s upset with Mexico. He has every reason to be upset with Mexico. Mexico could solve this problem. The people that are coming over, that are flooding, that are creating this crisis at the border are not Mexicans. … Mexico is letting people from Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala come through their country stacking up at the border, not controlling any kind of flow of immigration.”
Trump himself is really to blame for creating the crisis, said Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.).
“No, in fact he’s creating this crisis interestingly,” Vargas said. “We’ve seen numbers larger than this a decade ago, and why were we able to handle it? The administration was trying to handle it. He’s trying to make this crisis, he’s making it a crisis and every time he opens his mouth in Central America they hear, ‘Oh, United States let’s go.’ He is, in a sense, getting more people to come.
“So all the things he’s doing as barbaric as they are, [are] actually making the situation worse,” he added. “I’ve lived on the border my entire life, I have to tell you, it’s never been like this, we’ve had larger numbers, absolutely we’ve had more people coming. But it’s worked better because the administration hasn’t been trying to make it a crisis. They’ve been trying to make it a crisis, trying to make it look bad.”

522,Potential Biden Opponents Offer Support for His Accuser,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/potential-biden-opponents-offer-support-for-his-accuser/,"At least two women who would be facing off with former vice president Joe Biden, if Biden jumps into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, have offered words of support for the former Nevada assemblywoman accusing him of inappropriate contact.
In an essay published online, the former assemblywoman alleged that the inappropriate physical contact took place in 2014, when she was the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor.
The allegations have rocked what seemed an almost inevitable entrance by Biden into the 2020 presidential campaign to take on incumbent Donald Trump. Biden has consistently led polling among the candidates and potential candidates.
Two female Democratic senators already in the presidential sweepstakes–Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts–offered words for Flores.

Asked about the issue by host Jonathan Karl during a segment of the ABC News program This Week, Klobuchar said, “I have no reason not to believe her, Jonathan and I think we know from campaigns, and from politics, that people raise issues and they have to address them and that’s what [Biden] will have to do with voters if he gets into the race.”
Warren was even more pointed when reporters asked her about the allegations.
“I read the op-ed last night. I believe Lucy Flores. And Joe Biden needs to give an answer,” she said.
Asked further whether Biden should abandon plans to join the race as a result, she replied, “That’s for Joe Biden to decide.”
Yet another Democratic senator, this one a male not running for president, seemed to balance the seriousness of the Flores allegation with his friendship for Biden.
“One allegation is not disqualifying, but it should be taken seriously,” said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois.

523,Republicans Respond to Mueller Probe by Setting Plans To Investigate The Investigators,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/republicans-respond-to-mueller-probe-by-setting-plans-to-investigate-the-investigators/,"As Democrats continue to joust for access to the full Mueller Report, Sen. Lindsey Graham and other prominent Republican supporters of Donald Trump are turning to probing those behind the two-year investigation which consumed much of Trump’s presidency.
Special counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up his investigation of Trump’s campaign with the submission of a confidential report. That report remains under seal.
However, Attorney General William “Bill” Barr released a four-page letter removing from Trump any onus of criminal activity.
Since then, Trump and his supporters have, at turns, been celebratory and eager for political vengeance against those seen as behind the investigation.
Trump is “genuinely angry because you have to think a little bit from his perspective,” said conservative columnist and editor Rich Lowry. “So he fires [then- FBI Director] James Comey, as far as I can tell, because Comey refused to say publicly what he was telling Trump privately which is, ‘Sir, you are not under investigation.’
“Soon as he fires him, he’s under investigation for two solid years with some people, serious people, suggesting he’s committed acts of treason,” Lowry added during a segment of the NBC News program, Meet The Press. “And I do think there should be an investigation [of] the investigators, not to wreak vengeance on anyone because I do think this process went off the rails.
“We let a garbage oppo gathered from Russian sources by an ex-foreign spy, the so-called dossier, distort our politics for two [years],” he concluded, referring to the so-called Steele dossier containing many salacious details on Trump compiled during the 2016 campaign by British operative Christopher Steele.

Graham, the South Carolina Republican who now chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, promised just such an investigation, including re-opening a probe into Trump’s 2016 opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton who was probed by the FBI for handling of emails during her tenure as secretary of state.
“People in her campaign were given immunity without anything in return. Nobody in the Clinton investigation went to jail for lying about the process because there was no process,” Graham said. “And I know Bill Barr pretty well, and he’s pretty upset about the way all this was handled. I don’t know if he’s going to have a special prosecutor to look at the probability of criminal misbehavior.
“I’m going to look at what happened from an oversight role. But I hope there’s a special counsel appointed to look at [Justice Department] corruption and political bias, you know? Because Mueller did his job against Trump. Nobody’s really looked at the Clinton campaign, the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] warrant abuse or the counterintelligence investigation for criminality yet and somebody should. So could an investigation into Hillary Clinton be reopened at this point then?”

524,CNN’s Henderson at Beto Rally: ‘Maybe the Most Electable Candidate Is Actually a White Male’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/cnns-henderson-at-beto-rally-maybe-the-most-electable-candidate-is-actually-a-white-male/,"Even with the historically diverse field contending for the Democratic presidential nomination, it may come back to a white man among the pack perceived as most electable, according to CNN’s senior political reporter.
“What’s interesting, and I talked to voters about this, and there is this sense of: ‘Do you need a white male to go up against Donald Trump,’ right? The last election you saw Hillary Clinton obviously fail in her bid to beat Donald Trump, so there is this idea of maybe the most electable candidate is actually a white male,” said senior political reporter Nia-Malika Henderson.
“So you see in the recent poll … the Quinnipiac poll, the three top vote getters — not vote getters, but the folks who so far feel like they would vote for are all white men at this point,” Henderson added. “By every other metric, so far are leading in that metric. I talked to an African-American woman, she said maybe some conservative church-goers might have a problem backing a woman. Keep in mind African-American women showed up and showed out for Hillary Clinton in 2016, but she field like maybe thee a little skeptical going forward in doing that. She’s one of the people who’s out here, looking for some specifics. She likes Beto O’Rourke, but she’s going to go away from here, hoping to hearing some more.”

O’Rourke’s candidacy had a strong launch out of the gate, raising an eye-popping initial $6.1 million but since then, he also has been dogged by trouble from his status as a white man among a historically diverse field of women, people of color and an LGBT American in the race.

525,How U.S. Politics Has Evolved Through The Ages,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/how-u-s-politics-has-evolved-through-the-ages/,"The Era of Donald Trump
When Trump emerged victorious in the 2016 presidential elections, many wondered what that would mean for American politics and also for the global political scenario.
Since then, Trump has called for, often VIA his Twitter account, more military budget, stricter immigration policies and a great, big border wall along United States’ shared border with Mexico.
But let’s be frank for a second, when Trump announced he would be running for presidency, it didn’t seem like he would make it too far. After all, there were many well-seasoned politicians that he would have to triumph over.
However, against all odds, the Republican party candidate, along with his anti-immigration policies such as the “Muslim Ban,” was hailed supreme over The Democratic Party’s nominee Hillary Clinton.
But do Trump’s beliefs resonate with The Republican Party, the party that he is affiliated to?
Major U.S. Political Parties
The United States’ politics has been majorly divided into two parties that have fought for the control of the government for decades; The Republican Party (often referred by the media as the Grand Old Party [GOP]) and The Democratic Party. Though there are several other minor parties, they have failed to gain political prominence compared to these two giants.
Modern day GOP is more center-left or in an easier term, the more conservative of the two parties. The Democrats are left-leaning or liberals.
However, looking at the history of these major political parties, one finds a huge contrast in the beliefs that they started out with to what they stand for now. In fact, it is a complete 180 degree turn.

Founded in 1854, The Republican Party, believe it or not, came into being based on their stand against slavery, with Abraham Lincoln on the forefront. They fought for the freedom of African-Americans and their rights to vote. The Democratic party started out as staunch conservatives.
For most of the 19th century, the parties stuck to their founding beliefs, with the Republicans asking for better tackling of social issues with the election of President Benjamin Harrison in 1888.
The Shift in Beliefs
It was in 1896, that the parties, started on to what would result in the reversal of values.
The Democrats nominated populist firebrand William Jennings Bryan, “The Great Commoner,” for presidency. He was the first liberal to be nominated for the White House from the party. A major shift in America’s oldest political party was around the horizon.
The Republican Party had also started it’s shift to the conservative side.
Theodore Roosevelt was probably the last Republican liberal, who received a Nobel Prize in 1906, for playing a major role in ending the war between Russia and Japan.
Roosevelt remained extremely unhappy with his successor, William Howard Taft, whom he thought was presenting a far-right set of belief that did not resonate with The Republican Party that Roosevelt aligned himself with. In fact, he challenged Taft’s GOP nomination in 1912.
Roosevelt split form the Republican Party and by the early 1900s, it was more seen as an elitist party, because of their roots in different business, which was quite in contrast with the origins of the GOP.
Taft was easily defeated after Roosevelt’s exit from the party, the split (in the party between Taft favoring conservatives and Roosevelt favoring liberals) made it impossible for the former to get re-elected.

However, the GOP still enjoyed support from African Americans because of their anti-slavery stance, despite the change in politics and general belief at the center of the party. After all, Lincoln was responsible for granting emancipation to the community, giving them voting rights and calling for equality. To many, the Democrats still represented segregation and racism.
The Great Depression and New Deal
In the 1920s, around the time of The Great Depression, something changed as more and more African-Americans began leaving the South and the Democrats in the North soon understood that in order to govern they need to form an alliance with the community.
When The Great Depression struck, many Americans blamed the Republicans for the crisis, who had enjoyed from the flourishing 1920s.
As a result of public’s anger, Franklin D. Roosevelt, easily defeated the Republican incumbent, Herbert Hoover, in 1932.
FDR’s “New Deal,” around that time, achieved landmark progressive reforms, introducing an era of Democratic dominance that would last a good 60 years.
Initially, Roosevelt did not garner any support from the African-American community which still associated him with the beliefs of the Democratic party they had known all these years. However, all changed after his first term in charge. The communities benefited from the program and with the Roosevelt administration’s policies and Eleanor Roosevelt’s Civil Rights’ activism, the African American communities casted their votes for a Democratic president, for the first time in history, in 1936.
The New Deal also divided the Republican Party with some Republicans willing to accept the deal but not Roosevelt and others denouncing it completely.
The 1964 Civil Rights Act and The Conservative Republicans
In 1964, when President Lyndon Johnson introduced The Civil RIghts act, there came a monumental change in southern politics.
While the act received bipartisan support from most Republicans and Democrats, then Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater became the politician who voted against it. After that, it did not matter how progressive he was, the Republican party was seen as the party which supported a nominee who was against civil rights. This drew a massive wedge between the GOP and the African-American community.

The southern segregationists, till then, had largely associated with the Democratic party, however, in Goldman, they found way to switch to the GOP, which then gave the latter, dominance in the south, which they still maintain to date. The southerners wanted to stop the civil rights movement and this gave them way into the GOP party, effectively changing party dynamics.
The GOP Emerges as The Conservative Party
In the 1980s, then Republican President Ronald Reagan, pushed the idea of a true conservative running the country and he was quite successful. He softened the idea of conservatism. Ever since, liberal and moderate Republicans have not found them at the forefront of the party.
Barack Obama
In 2007, Barack Obama was sworn in as the United States president; the first African American to do so. He would go on to serve two terms in the office.
Obama’s time at the White House, cemented a more clear divide between the two parties, with Republicans firm in their stance as conservatives and Democrats as liberals.
Bipartisan Politics and the Importance of Compromise
With the election of Trump, the wedge has only grown deeper as he looks to tackle immigration in the extreme.
Although, that wasn’t always the case. Over the years, many politicians from both sides of the parties, believed in compromise and working together if it was in favor of America, setting their differences aside.
Prominent Republicans like John McCain and Reagan understood that it was impossible to get everything you wanted in legislations and you had to bow down and work together in politics .
Reagan criticised such politicians, whom he referred to as “radical conservatives,” in his autobiography. According to him, they “wouldn’t face the fact that we couldn’t get all of what we wanted. . . . They wanted all or nothing and they wanted it all at once. If you don’t get it all, some said, don’t take anything.” Reagan went on to say, “I’d learned while negotiating union contracts that you seldom got everything you asked for. And I agreed with FDR, who said in 1933: ‘I have no expectations of making a hit every time I come to bat.”

Former president and Democrat Barack Obama seemed to agree with Reagan.
He said, “change requires more than just speaking out—it requires listening, as well. In particular, it requires listening to those with whom you disagree, and being prepared to compromise. . . . Democracy requires compromise, even when you are 100 percent right.”
While it is difficult to find examples of compromise and cooperation between politicians from both parties in recent politics, the best example, according to Walter G. Moss, a professor emeritus of history at Eastern Michigan University, would perhaps be that of Senators Orrin Hatch and Edward Kennedy. After Kennedy’s death in 2009, Hatch described how the two worked together, despite their differences and why it’s important:
“We did not agree on much, and more often than not, I was trying to derail whatever big government scheme he had just concocted. We did manage to forge partnerships on key legislation, such as the Ryan White AIDS Care Act, State Children’s Health Insurance Program, and most recently, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act. Ted was a lion among liberals, but he was also a constructive and shrewd lawmaker. He never lost sight of the big picture and was willing to compromise on certain provisions in order to move forward on issues he believed important. . . .
I hope that America’s ideological opposites in Congress, on the airwaves, in cyberspace, and in the public square will learn that being faithful to a political party or a philosophical view does not preclude civility, or even friendships, with those on the other side. . . . I hope that Americans in general and Washington politicians in particular will take a lesson from Ted’s life and realize that we must aggressively advocate for our positions but realize that in the end, we have to put aside political pandering, work together and do what is best for America.”
Perhaps Obama’s words most aptly describe why compromise is so important in politics, “The best of the American spirit [is] having the audacity to believe despite all the evidence to the contrary that we could restore a sense of community to a nation torn by conflict.”
One can hope that politicians from both parties understand and value working together if it means to put their country first. After all, that is the whole essence of being a politician, doing what’s best for your country.

526,Ocasio-Cortez on Banning Cows: I Had ‘Staffer Who Had a Very Bad Day at Work’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-on-banning-cows-i-had-staffer-who-had-a-very-bad-day-at-work/,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) responded to criticism that the expansive Green New Deal aims to outlaw cattle in the United States due to the methane from their flatulence by saying that it was the result of poor staff work.
Ocasio-Cortez made her remarks during a town hall-style meeting about the Green New Deal, an ambitious proposal to take on the challenge of climate change while also extending economic opportunity and security.
Ocasio-Cortez is sponsoring the Green New Deal with Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass).
Opponents of the Green New Deal, particularly Republicans, have glommed onto this statement that the Green New Deal would outlaw cattle due to the fact that the methane in their flatulence constitutes greenhouse gas emissions.

But wait, said Ocasio-Cortez said, don’t worry about your cheeseburgers just yet.
“What I will say is that I definitely have a staffer that had a very bad day at work and we did release a working draft early,” she said. “So I get that’s what they’re seizing on. But really what we need to do is have a serious conversation and even in those draft versions, what they were talking about and is really about the fact that we need to innovate on our technology.”
Rather than damage the US economy, one important aim of the Green New Deal is to create “good, dignified, unionized jobs” with the expansion of clean, green energy and related industries, Ocasio-Cortez said.
Talk of creating all of those good jobs while taking meaningful action on climate change clearly has spurred congressional Republicans on this issue in a way they never have been before, according to Heather McGhee, senior fellow at Demos, a progressive think tank in Washington.
“And I don’t think you would have [Sen. Lamar] Alexander [R-Tenn.] and [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell [R-Ky.] for the first time this month say human beings are causing [climate change] and it’s real if it weren’t for a solution rooted in one of the most popular pieces of legislation,” McGhee said. “It’s popular in Colorado, North Carolina, Iowa, Maine. Places where Republican senators are looking at their prospects and saying, ‘Why do we want to be the party of ‘no’ on millions of new jobs?’”
While some look at the planned broad scope of the Green New Deal with concern, Ocasio-Cortez said that it is driven by the scientific consensus, such as that of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which finds that humanity has but a finite time to address the climate issue before changes become irrevocable and ever-worsening across the planet.
“Here is the thing is I get that in our political context in the history of health care, in the history of labor rights, in the history of women’s rights, these are long struggles and generational struggles and that is something important for young activists, as well,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We’re not the first. We will not be on the last. We stand on the shoulders of giants, but climate change is different because we have an expiration date, and the IPCC report says we’ve got 12 years to turn it around. Twelve years.

“So my concern is that we are going to be the frog in the pot of boiling water, and we are going to debate and debate and debate and debate, and when we actually finally pass something, it’s a wimpy carbon tax and our kids are doomed,” she said.

527,Chris Wallace: Trump Gave Democrats a ‘Gift’ With Healthcare,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/chris-wallace-trump-gave-democrats-a-gift-with-healthcare/,"By diving in with a court case intended to overturn Obamacare, Donald Trump has inexplicably handed Democrats an important weapon to use against him as he seeks re-election next year, according to Fox News host Chris Wallace.
Trump’s Justice Department just this week joined a lawsuit which could topple the entire nine-year-old Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. Not only would that pull health coverage from tens of millions of Americans, it would rescind the protection the all Americans have that guarantee access to coverage, even with pre-existing conditions.
Although the ACA started out being very unpopular, it has grown in popularity in recent years–particularly such provisions as the pre-existing conditions protection.
Trump had had an opening to attack Democrats who want to move health coverage to a single-payer, “Medicare for all” system, but Trump himself closed it by refocusing on Obamacare, Wallace said during a recent Fox News segment.

“But the president, again, gave them this gift by saying he wants to strike down Obamacare,” he said. “So [Democrats] don’t have to defend Medicare-for-all anymore, all they have to do is say they’re for Obamacare and an improved version of Obamacare.
“So, in a sense, he’s made it easier for at least the moderates, centrists, and the mainstream of the House Democratic leadership, Nancy Pelosi, folks like that, to say we’re not going to focus on Medicare-for-all … ” Wallace added.

528,"Republican Pressure on Schiff Intensifies, as Pelosi Backs Him Up",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/republican-pressure-on-schiff-intensifies-as-pelosi-backs-him-up/,"Top Republicans, including Donald Trump, kept up their pressure campaign against Rep. Adam Schiff, attempting to push the California Democrat off his perch as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee–if not force him out of Congress entirely.
The attacks against Schiff are part of an overall plan of retribution against Trump’s political adversaries, which has ramped up since special counsel Robert Mueller wrapped up his investigation and Attorney General William “Bill” Barr released his letter taking any onus off of Trump on criminal offenses related to Mueller’s probe into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia–and any subsequent obstruction of justice.
As first ranking Democrat, and chairman since January of the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff has been one of Trump’s most dogged critics and persuers.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-Calif.) made it clear that he and other House Republicans want House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to strip Schiff of his position atop Intelligence, saying that he cannot be trusted.
“Today, in that hearing, every single Republican signed a letter that this chairman, they have lost confidence. They do not believe, no matter what they work on, that the American public can trust him,” McCarthy said. “This is not a committee that’s set by a steering committee. One person alone decides who sits on that committee for the Democrat and one person who decides on the Republican side — me. It’s now up to Nancy Pelosi to remove Chairman Schiff. The idea that you would have a chairman of a committee of this nature, the work that is involved in this committee, that would lie to the American public, not apologize, but use the tactics of Senator Joe McCarthy to attack his own members, there’s nothing that could come from this committee that can be trusted. It is time to turn the page.
“The Democrats have wasted their majority. Does Adam Schiff truly believe he knows something more than Mueller, that 40 FBI agents, 19 attorneys, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 witnesses, looking into 13 different countries and saying no collusion at all? He needs to resign from the committee. There is a difference here, drastically. One member lied to the American public, one member told the truth and was attacked for it. Now that the truth is told that [former] chairman [Devin] Nunes [R-Calif.] was correct and that truth is told that Adam Schiff lied to the American public, continued to lie up until March of this year, now I think the speaker and I should get together in remove Schiff.”
Trump himself called Schiff out at his rally in Michigan, calling him “little pencil-necked Adam Schiff.”
Rep. Mike Conaway (R–Tex.) confronted Schiff directly during the course of a session of the intelligence panel.

“Your willingness to continue to promote a demonstrably false narrative is alarming. The findings of the special counsel conclusively refute your past and present assertions and have exposed you as having abused your position to knowingly promote false information. Damaged the integrity of this committee and undermined the faith in the United States government and institutions. Your actions, both past and present, are incompatible with your duty as chairman of this committee, which alone in the House of Representatives has the obligation and authority to provide effective oversight of the U.S. intelligence community,” Conaway said. “As such, we have no faith in your ability to discharge your duties in a manner consistent with your constitutional responsibility and urge your immediate resignation as chairman of the committee. Mr. Chairman, this letter is signed by all nine members of the Republican side of the House — of the committee and I ask it be entered into the record at today’s hearing.”
Pelosi showed no sign of bending to GOP wishes, however, and stoutly defended Schiff.
“I’m so proud of the work of Chairman Adam Schiff in a stark contrast to the irresponsible almost criminal behavior of the previous chair of the committee,” she said, referring to Nunes, who was a Trump ally in the Russia investigation. “So what is the president afraid of? Is he afraid of the truth that he would go after a member a chairman of a committee, a respected chairman of a committee in the Congress? I think they’re just scaredy cats. They just don’t know what to do, so they have to make an attack. They did the wrong thing, American people know that.”
For his own part, Schiff continued to assert collusion.

“You might think it’s okay that the National Security Advisor-designate secretly conferred with a Russian ambassador about undermining U.S. sanctions, and you might think it’s okay that he lied about it to the F.B.I. You might say that’s all okay,” Schiff said referring to Michael Flynn, who briefly served as Trump’s first national security adviser before having to plead guilty to a felony and cooperate with the Mueller probe.
“You might say that’s just what you need to do to win. But I don’t think it’s okay. I think it’s immoral, I think it’s unethical, I think it’s unpatriotic. And yes, I think it’s corrupt and evidence of collusion,” Schiff added. “Now, I have always said that the question of whether this amounts to proof of conspiracy was another matter. Whether the special counsel could prove beyond a reasonable doubt the proof of that crime would be up to the special counsel and I would accept his decision and I do. He’s a good and honorable man and he is a good prosecutor. But I do not think that conduct, criminal or not, is okay. And the day we do think that’s okay is the day we will look back and say that is the day America lost its way.”

529,Ocasio-Cortez New Target at Trump Rally,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-new-target-at-trump-rally/,"Hillary Clinton and “Lock her up!” is so 2017.
However, Donald Trump Jr. field-tested a new chant and new Democratic villain at one of his father’s rallies, this one in Michigan.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a freshman member of Congress, increasingly has become a foil for Trump and his Republican allies, particularly since she introduced the expansive “Green New Deal” with Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass) both to address climate change and economic inequality.
The program has attracted much derision on the right, both for cost and its attention to “cow farts.”

As her profile has risen in recent months, Ocasio-Cortez has become known by the shorthand moniker “AOC.”
At the Trump rally in Michigan, the crowd, which once would chant the Hillary Clinton taunt, “Lock her up!” instead broke out in, “AOC sucks!”
“Think about the fact that every mainstream, leading Democratic contender is taking the advice of a freshman congresswoman who three weeks ago didn’t know the three branches of government,” Don Jr. told the crowd.

Ocasio-Cortez is a self-identified democratic socialist. Although she won’t be running for president next year, a strategy appears to be emerging to tie Democrats to her, overall, to paint them as too extreme.

530,Pete Buttigieg is NOT Jed Bartlet — He’s Better,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/democrats/pete-buttigieg-is-not-jed-bartlet-hes-better/,"American popular culture is a Moebius loop of art imitating life and life imitating art, a two-headed snake — one made from entertainment and the other from the never-ending news cycle — gnawing on its own tail.
Is it truly coincidence that state after state recognized same-sex marriage, leading to a Supreme Court decision making it the law of the land, during the same period where shows like Will & Grace topped the ratings? Conversely, there is a sociological throughpoint that was launched with the entertainment industry’s fascination with the zombie apocalypse and it’s ends-justifies-the-means survival theme and the rise of “America First” Trumpism.
And, seriously, if you’ve never been cornered by a hardcore West Wing nerd and schooled on the connection between the fictional campaign of Latino candidate Matt Santos (played with gusto by Jimmy Smits) and the ascendancy just a year and a half later by a senator from Illinois named Barack Obama, well then, you’ve never truly known fear.
If we want to get a handle on what the next social and political trends will be, we need look no further than the Nielsen ratings and box office returns. Those numbers are far more predictive than Nate Silver wearing Professor X’s Cerebro helmet. What the industry calls viewers in those reports are called voters by every political strategist in the business.

And that brings us to something sneaky that carries us from the series that ended in 2007 to the amazing candidacy of South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter Buttigieg which is happening in real time — it was actually heralded by a massive resurgence in the popularity of the show, which is now enjoying a consistent viewership on Netflix. According to Google Trends, the show is being viewed (and viewed again) on the streaming service more than ever.  Former co-star Josh Malina (Deputy Communications Director Will Baily) hosts a West Wing fan podcast with more than 1.2 million listeners. There are network TV shows that don’t have that large an audience.
And so the comparisons have already begun all across social media. Buttigieg’s authenticity, matched only by his sense of nuance and casual, but palpable, command of the issues has people clamoring that he is quickly becoming our real-life Jed Bartlet, the president with a once-in-a-generation mind played to Emmy-nominated perfection by Martin Sheen. But they’re wrong. Pete Buttigieg is no Jed Bartlet — he’s better.
Starting with the trivial side of the equation, Jed Bartlet spoke only four languages while Mayor Pete speaks eight, most notably having taught himself Norwegian so he could read a book written in the language. And even then, Buttigieg is realistic about those linguistic skills. In a recent interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, he pointed out that he would not be considered “fluent” in all of them because it’s not like he walks around the house practicing all the time. And there’s another difference — Pete’s mastery of humility and nuance when the camera is turned on. Bartlet’s character was known for his arrogance, using it to “knock some bodies down” in a season 4 debate with a fictional Republican presidential opponent. Mayor Pete doesn’t knock bodies down so much as he blows people away with how he can be so compelling without feeling the need to hip-check any conservative within skating distance.
But the key differences between the factual Pete and the fictional Jed reside in the places where they seem the most similar. Bartlet was an undeniable product of privilege. His great grandfather was a signatory to the Declaration of Independence. He went to a boarding school where his stepfather was the headmaster, and he never served in the military. Of course, Buttigieg also went to a religious prep school, South Bend’s renowned St. Joseph’s, where he was class president and valedictorian. But his father was an immigrant, and his mom a South Bender, both of whom taught at Notre Dame, coincidentally Bartlet’s alma mater. In real life, Buttigieg wound up at Harvard, graduating Magna Cum laude with a BA in history and literature, compared to Bartlet’s eventual Ph.D. in economics.

But where Bartlet’s initial fictional aim at Notre Dame was to become a priest, Mayor Pete always had governmental service in mind. He was the president of Harvard’s Institute of Politics Student Advisory Committee and was accepted to Harvard in part for his winning the JFK Profiles in Courage Essay Contest while he was still in high school. Ironically, the essay was about a radical Vermont political figure, Bernie Sanders.
But the most telling difference between art and life in this comparison is their view of state and local politics. While Bartlet led his make-believe Democratic Party, multiple episodes saw him direct campaign financing away from local races, with his party’s core attention on the 535 elected offices in Washington. Mayor Pete believes that if there will be sweeping change in our political culture, it will come from the energizing local politics in order to bring the national water to a boil.
The Democratic National Committee is always vulnerable to this gravitational force that makes it treat the presidency like it’s the only office that matters,” Buttigieg told CNN two years ago. “My hope is that [DNC Chair Tom Perez] will direct the party toward working from the bottom up.”
So while Jed Bartlet was clearly the right man at the right time for NBC, it may well be that Mayor Pete Buttigieg may be the man the real America needs just in time. The ratings are already in, so we’ll just have to see how the vote turns out.

531,"Spurned by GOP, Senate Democrats Launch Their Own Climate Committee",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/spurned-by-gop-senate-democrats-launch-their-own-climate-committee/,"Their resolution to establish a bipartisan select committee on climate change stymied by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) established a new Senate Democrats’ Special Committee on the Climate Crisis. 
The committee—comprised of 10 Democratic senators—will be tasked with investigating, holding hearings, and issuing findings on the economic and national security consequences of climate change and how acting on the climate crisis presents significant opportunities for jobs, public health, and the economy, Senate Democrats announced.
More specifically, the committee will work with environmental, financial, and national security experts to find solutions for communities impacted by climate change and provide oversight on special interests that foster climate denial, Democrats said.
Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) will chair the committee, and members include Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nev.), and Tina Smith (D-Minn.).  

The creation of the new committee is one of many steps Democrats are taking to remain on the offense and highlight the economic and human cost of inaction on climate change. Recently, the entire Senate Democratic Caucus co-sponsored a resolution stating that climate change is real, caused by humans, and that the United States and Congress need to take immediate action to address it.
“In order to take bold action, we need a broad coalition. We have put together a group of people who are leading on climate in different ways. And that is going to be the foundation for our success,” said Schatz. “With this group, we have the necessary pieces to take this issue seriously — to make real inquiries and real analysis. We are treating this like the planetary emergency it is.”
Senate Democrats also Demanded major climate investments in any infrastructure bill that the Senate might consider.

532,Advice to Biden on Changing The ‘White Man’s Culture’: Don’t Run,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/advice-to-biden-on-changing-the-white-mans-culture-dont-run/,"If former vice president Joe Biden is sincere in lamenting the “white man’s culture” of the United States, then he simply should not run for president, according to one CNN political analyst.
Biden, who is said to be very close to jumping into what already is a crowded field of contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, raised the issue of the prevalence of a “white man’s culture” at a recent banquet in New York.
He raised it in the context of the 1991 confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.
Biden’s role in those hearings as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has come under growing scrutiny as he has edged closer to a White House run due to the treatment of Anita Hill, who had accused Thomas of sexual misconduct.

“A really notable woman, Anita Hill, professor, showed the courage of a lifetime talking about her experience being harassed by Clarence Thomas,” Biden said at the New York City banquet. “We knew a lot less about the extent of harassment back then, over 30 years ago. But she paid a terrible price. She was abused through the hearing. She was taken advantage of. Her reputation was attacked.”
Others still believe, to this day, that Biden did not do enough for Hill.
“He hasn’t accepted the ownership of the fact that he was the most powerful person in the role and in the room at that time,” Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, told The Washington Post. “I think that he has a hard time because he doesn’t really completely understand yet. He is still protecting his gender.”
Should he enter the presidential contest, Biden would immediately vault to front-runner status, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll.
Neither Biden’s words or popularity satisfied CNN political analyst Joan Walsh, a prominent progressive journalist.
“I have an idea for how he can change it,” Walsh said of the “white man’s culture.”
“Don’t run. Come out and support a woman,” she added. “There’s six women in the race, four female senators. If you want to change it, that’s a way to change it. You know, I admire Joe Biden. I am a fond Democrat. He was a great vice president. But you want to change it? Don’t run. And his treatment of Anita Hill will remain a huge issue if he does run.”

533,"While Republicans ‘Get Their Kicks Hurting People,’ Democrats Launch New Healthcare Bill",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/while-republicans-get-their-kicks-hurting-people-democrats-launch-new-healthcare-bill/,"While Donald Trump’s administration has tied itself to a court case designed to strike down the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as Obamacare, House Democrats put forward new legislation aimed at strengthening the ACA.
Trump’s Justice Department has involved itself in an appellate case which potentially could do what Republicans could not do in Congress: bring down the nine-year-old ACA.
“Let me just tell you exactly what my message is: The Republican Party will soon be known as the party of health care,” Trump said.
It was an odd message for Trump, given that, he and his Republicans have no comprehensive alternative ready if the ACA were to fall. Moreover, although the law began as unpopular years ago, it has become much more popular with the American people in recent years.

A Kaiser Family Foundation poll just this month found 50 percent support the ACA, compared to just 39 percent opposed.
“The Republican Party is going to be known as the party of taking health care away from millions of Americans,” said Julian Castro, an Obama administration Cabinet official and now more than a dozen Democrats running for president. “… That this administration is going completely against the will of the people. Going against the will of Congress. And trying to pull the rug out from under millions and millions of American families. People who have preexisting conditions, who are only able to get health insurance–able to afford health insurance because the Affordable Care Act–says you cannot consider preexisting conditions to those health insurers.
“So basically, this administration and the Republican Party wants to go back to the bad old days where people couldn’t get health insurance if they had a preexisting condition, where folks were not able to stay on their parents’ plan until the age of 26. They got thrown off a lot earlier. And generally, where millions and millions of people less had health insurance,” Castro added during an appearance on CNN. “I mean, the Affordable Care Act at one time before this administration started to sabotage it, 20 million more people were able to get affordable health care coverage. That had been amazing. And it is something else to watch a president and a party that get their kicks out of hurting people, whether it’s with health care or those children that they’re separating from their families at the border. It is just amazing to watch.”
While Trump was touting his administration’s role in the lawsuit which could bring down the ACA, over on Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats were rolling out the Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions & Making Health Care More Affordable Act.

The legislation would lower healthcare insurance premiums, stop so-called junk health plans, strengthen protections for pre-existing conditions and reverse the sabotage and neglect of the ACA at the hands of Trump and other Republicans, Pelosi said.
“Protecting and strengthening health care is why Democrats are here. On Day One, the first day, as we were sworn in the 116th Congress, the House voted to intervene against Republicans’ monstrous health care lawsuit,” Pelosi said.
“We continued to work on legislation to lower prescription drug prices for seniors and families across America. And today, led by our freshmen, we are taking another big step forward to lower health care costs for the American people,” she added.

534,Sen. Rand Paul Recommends Trump Pardon Michael Flynn,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/sen-rand-paul-recommends-trump-pardon-michael-flynn/,"President Trump ought to pardon one of the earliest targets of the now-ended Mueller investigation, advised Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY).
Trump should pardon Michael Flynn, who served as Trump’s first national security adviser for a brief three weeks before being forced to resign because he misled Vice President Pence and the FBI over his communication with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
In the end, Flynn pled guilty to a single felony charge of making “false, fictitious and fraudulent” statements to the FBI and entered into a cooperation agreement with special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his investigation into any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Flynn had also served as an adviser to Trump during his campaign.

The underlying case against Flynn is based on unconstitutional evidence, Paul argued.
“No American should be prosecuted for something they said in a private phone call unless a judge gave a warrant to the government and said they can listen to the phone call,” Paul said in an interview with Fox News. “They listened to General Flynn because they were spying on the ambassador. Okay, that’s foreign intelligence, but that shouldn’t be domestic prosecution. So what they did to Flynn––not only was it unfair, but I think should be unconstitutional. And I’ve been bugging the president for years to come forward and fix this for all Americans and say that no foreign intelligence gathering of information could ever be used against an American citizen in court for a crime unrelated to terrorism.
“So what they did to General Flynn was unfair, and I have told the president––he’s not responded to me––but I’ve told him my opinion is that he ought to pardon General Flynn,” Paul added.
Trump has used his presidential pardon power in several controversial cases, including former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, but so far Trump has not used it with anyone connected to the Mueller probe.

535,"Calling It a ‘Defect in Our Democracy,’ Ex-AG Holder Says The Electoral College Must Go",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/calling-it-a-defect-in-our-democracy-ex-ag-holder-says-the-electoral-college-must-go/,"The United States ought to do away with the Electoral College, according to former attorney general Eric Holder, calling it “a defect in our democracy.”
“We have had in the last five elections two presidents who were not — did not win the popular vote. The presidency is the one office in this country that represents all of the people,” said Holder, who served as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer through the first several years of the Obama administration. “You have a district representative, congressman, you have a person who represents your state or two people represent your state, you have senators and you vote for them in a direct way. Seems to me we ought to have a direct election of the president of the United States.”
Holder said how he sees removing the Electoral College would put more voters up for grabs, and the candidates would have to work harder to court them.

“If we did that, you would have Republicans who would be campaigning in California. The Republican would campaign in New York. The Democrat would campaign in Texas,” he said. “That means in some swing states, smaller states, would not get as much attention as they do now but I think the vast majority of people in this country would get a great deal more attention, attention that they deserve. But I don’t want that to take away from the focus … on the problem of gerrymandering. That is what I have devoted most of my post-government life towards, eliminating this whole problem of gerrymandering.”
Gerrymandering involves creating congressional districts tailored to be most easily won by a specific candidate or political party, rather than creating them to keep geographic locations or populations together.

536,Democrats Remain Convinced of Trump’s Collusion,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/democrats-remain-convinced-of-trumps-collusion/,"They may be bowing to the changed political by pivoting toward healthcare and other issues, but a number of prominent Democrats remain convinced of Donald Trump’s guilt in connection with the Mueller investigation.
Special counsel Robert Mueller last week wrapped up a two-year investigation into whether Trump colluded with the Russians to tilt the 2016 presidential election toward Trump–and any subsequent obstruction of justice.
Mueller submitted a confidential report to Attorney General William “Bill” Barr. Although that report remains under wraps, Barr released a short summary, which essentially removes from Trump any onus for criminal activity.
While Trump and his supporters have, by turns, responded with celebration and a desire for retribution against political opponents, many Democrats remain unconvinced of Trump’s innocence.
“I have seen the campaign for myself and others and I would say the only person who made false statements about Russia is Donald Trump,” said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee. “I stand by what I said about seeing evidence of collusion and if he has a problem with that, he can sue me.”
Mueller’s true conclusions are not known because the full and complete Mueller report is not yet available, noted Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a former state attorney general.

“Even if the Mueller report says that he could not establish–that’s his word–proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that’s a very high bar. There may still be evidence. In fact there is already in the public realm,” Blumenthal said. “And that evidence is what I was citing. For example, the president’s encouragement of the Russians to provide more hacked information. His knowledge of the Wikileaks release and his encouragement there, his negotiations on the Trump Tower Moscow at the same time that he was praising [Russian leader] Vladimir Putin.
“A string of highly significant public evidence of cooperation that may have only been tacit, without criminal intent, but his own campaign manager shared polling data, sensitive, private polling data with the Russians while they were attacking this country through a campaign of misinformation,” he added.
Then there is the still-unknown reason for the oddly subservient relationship Trump has with Putin, said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii).
“So just because there was not enough evidence for a criminal charge of conspiracy does not mean that this very cozy relationship that Donald Trump has with Vladimir Putin—who, by the way, must be really happy that this came about—that this kind of cozy relationship that is not good for our country, in that it’s not transparent, will continue,” she said.

537,"With A Need To Avoid ‘Sour Grapes,’ House Democrats To Refocus on Healthcare, Other Issues",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/with-a-need-to-avoid-sour-grapes-house-democrats-to-refocus-on-healthcare-other-issues/,"Although House Democrats plan to continue their ongoing investigations into Donald Trump, his campaign, administration and business, now that the onus is off of Trump following the end of the Mueller probe, they plan to focus much more publicly on healthcare and other issues they campaigned on last year to win the House majority.
Special counsel Robert Mueller last week wrapped up his two-year investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to tilt the 2016 presidential election to Trump–and any subsequent obstruction of justice.
Mueller submitted a confidential report which remains sealed. However, Attorney General William “Bill” Barr released a short summary which essentially took any onus off of Trump for any criminal activity.
“There are so many legitimate questions about the attorney general’s summary of Mueller’s report, including whether or not Barr’s account amounts to something of a bit of a whitewash,” said NBC political host Chuck Todd. “But the challenge facing Democrats, and yes, some of us in the press, too, is that Barr’s summary has made it easy for people to dismiss all of those questions as sour grapes. But they shouldn’t be dismissed, and we as journalists have to ask them. The partisans can do what they do, and we do what we do.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and many others in her majority reportedly have come to a similar political calculus, as Pelosi had a meeting on the way forward Monday evening.

The Democrats are ready to more forcefully refocus on healthcare and other issues of priority to the American people. The Trump administration, particularly, have provided Democrats an opening on healthcare, as the administration has jumped on a lawsuit to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
Although some liberals in the majority have been reluctant to give up going after Trump, a progressive leader like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) bent to the new political environment.
“We’re taking a look at it but you know every member has to pursue what they see as right and what their district wants,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I think what’s tough is impeachment in principle is something that I openly support, but it’s also just the reality of having the votes in the Senate to pursue that, and so that’s something that we have to take into consideration.”
House Democrats said that, at this point, talk of impeachment, is limited to just a handful of the majority.

538,"After Mueller Probe, The Head of The RNC Wants ‘a Reckoning’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/after-mueller-probe-the-head-of-the-rnc-wants-a-reckoning/,"Following Attorney General William “Bill” Barr’s weekend release of his letter which essentially clears Donald Trump of any wrongdoing related to the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump’s supporters continue to take a hard line, looking for retribution for the investigation which had consumed most of Trump’s presidency thus far.
The letter Barr released was his summary of the final report prepared by special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to tilt the election to Trump–and any subsequent obstruction of justice.
The full Mueller report has not been made public. But Barr’s summary essentially set aside any of those concerns, leaving Trump and his supporters both celebrating and seeking political payback against those among Democrats and in the press who stoked the investigation over the last two years.

“It is really shameful for two years, this cloud has been upon his presidency, it was precipitated by a fake dossier paid for Hillary Clinton and [Democratic National Committee] that the Justice Department ran with, Democrats for two years accused our president of being an agent for a foreign country, they put that narrative forward over and over with the media, being complicit,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox Business host Lou Dobbs.
“[Some] 93 percent of the negative stories from the media have been negative on this president, media has been shameful, there needs to be a reckoning,” she added. “I am glad that president is found to not colluded we all knew that. I do not want to gloss over what just happened over last two years it has been dangerous for our democracy we not had objectivity in our media enough to look at the facts of the case, they have run with it. It has been reckless and damaged our democracy.”

539,"Target of Suspicion, ‘Cindy’ Yang Says She’s Only Victim of Prejudice",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/target-of-suspicion-cindy-yang-says-shes-only-victim-of-prejudice/,"A woman tied to message parlors associated with human trafficking, as well as accused of running an operation to sell access to President Trump to foreign nationals has denied all of the allegations.
Concern over Li “Cindy” Yang grew to such levels that top congressional Democrats sought criminal and national security investigations into her and her activities.
Allegations against Yang tied her Florida message parlors to human trafficking of sex workers and using her apparent relationship with Trump for profit, particularly selling that access to Chinese national business people.
Yang denied all of that in a recent TV interview, saying that she is nothing more than a loyal Republican.

“Today in Florida she told us the last few weeks have been a nightmare. Ever since [New England Patriots owner] Robert Kraft was charged with soliciting sex at the Orchids of Asia day spa,” said NBC News journalist Cynthia McFadden. “The Miami Herald reported Cindy Yang was the original owner of the spa. A series of high-profile articles since have raised questions about whether she was engaged in illegal businesses, whether she was selling access to President Trump, and whether she’s been working for the Chinese government as a spy.”
But Yang, who sold the spa seven years ago, says none of it is true, McFadden reported.
“She’s given money to the Republicans, like millions of others. And has only two pictures of herself with Donald Trump, who she does not know,” McFadden added. “She says it all comes down to prejudice.”

540,2020 Hopeful Buttigieg: A Figure Like Trump ‘Should Never Have Been Able to Come Within Cheating Distance of the Oval Office’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/2020-hopeful-buttigieg-a-figure-like-trump-should-never-have-been-able-to-come-within-cheating-distance-of-the-oval-office/,"The result of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Donald Trump and his 2016 campaign should be a warning for the future, according to Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg.
Mueller and his team for two years probed whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia–as well as any obstruction of justice. However, Mueller ended his probe Friday without seeking indictments of Trump or any of his immediate family involved in the campaign.
“The president is not being indicted at the moment and also has not been exonerated at the moment. From a political perspective, I think this is further evidence it would be a mistake for Democrats to think that the way for the Trump presidency to end is by way of investigation,” Buttigieg, the two-term mayor of South Bend, Ind., said during a segment on MSNBC. “That could, of course, happen. But we’ve got to be paying attention to the kinds of conditions that made it possible for somebody like him to get here in the first place.”

“I would argue with—a figure like this president should never have been able to come within cheating distance of the Oval Office,” Buttigieg added. “And I fear if we’re not paying attention to the causes that he’s a symptom of, then not only is it possible for him to succeed in 2020, but we could also find ourselves with another figure like him or even worse in the future.”

541,"Rudy Giuliani, Anderson Cooper Agree: No Collusion Is Good for America",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/rudy-giuliani-anderson-cooper-agree-no-collusion-is-good-for-america/,"After two long years of waiting, the cloud of collision with Russia has been lifted from Donald Trump.
Trump, himself, as might be expected, has been been both exultant and defiant.

Attorney General William “Bill” Barr released a summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report, and according to Barr, Mueller found neither collusion nor obstruction of justice after the fact.
“After a long investigation, after so many people have been so badly hurt, after not looking at the other side where a lot of bad things happen, a lot of bad things happened for our country, it was just announced there was no collusion with Russia–the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard–there was no collusion with Russia, there was no obstruction and none whatsoever and it was a complete and total exoneration,” Trump said.
Trump’s supporters were equally pleased and delighted by the news.
“No obstruction, no collusion. The attorney general was about as explicit as you can be,” said Trump’s personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani. “The president has won a total and complete victory here. And only only the most bitter critics would deny him that. And any American should be very, very happy that this has been resolved this way. The only people who aren’t are people that just have bad motives.”
It hasn’t been only Trump supporters, either. Even CNN host Anderson Cooper struck a similar tone.
“It did strike me today with friends calling me, people calling me reading stuff on Twitter. It’s just how everyone sees this result through their own political lens,” Cooper said. “For those that hate the president, they’re disappointed he didn’t collude. I don’t understand. It’s good for the country and good for America our president did not collude.”

542,Prominent Progressive Organization Pushes Back Against Dems’ New Anti-Challenger Policy,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/prominent-progressive-organization-pushes-back-against-dems-new-anti-challenger-policy/,"A long-established and well-known progressive organization is taking on the Democratic Party over a new policy intended to protect congressional incumbents and freeze out challengers.
The new policy, articulated Friday by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, warns vendors that the party will no longer do business with shops which also perform work for primary challengers.

The DCCC, the arm of the party concerned with electing Democrats to the US House, says it has instituted this new policy because its officials believe its “core mission” includes “supporting and protecting incumbents.”
Vermont-based Democracy For America (DFA) objects to the new policy, calling it “the most anti-democratic thing” ever done by the DCCC.
Had this policy been in place last year, it certainly would have hamstrung successful primary challengers like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), each of whom won their seats last year only after defeating a long-standing veteran Democrat in a primary election.
“The DCCC is trying to create an atmosphere where vendors are terrified to work with primary challengers — and where primary challengers can’t find the help they need to run strong, effective, successful campaigns,” DFA Political Director Karli Wallace Thompson said in an email to supporters.
“This move isn’t happening in a vacuum,” Thompson added. “At a time when former primary challengers like AOC and Ayanna Pressley — both of whom DFA endorsed and supported — are shaking things up in Congress and making the old guard uncomfortable, it’s no coincidence that the establishment and their consultants are trying to snuff out future primary campaigns before they even begin.”
Thompson also solicited fundraising from supporters who received the email, ostensibly to provide support to those progressive Democratic challengers who would be stifled as a result of the new DCCC policy.
“DFA provides a strong support system for progressive candidates who are trying to bring the voices of working families to Congress,” Thompson said. “And we’re not going to stop fighting to elect a new generation of leaders, no matter how the DCCC tries to rig the game.”

543,"White House Celebrating Report ‘With Glee,’ But Trump May Yet Face ‘Negative Information’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/white-house-celebrating-report-with-glee-but-trump-may-yet-face-negative-information/,"Donald Trump, his family and those at the White House have been expressing relief and happiness over the Friday evening release of Robert Mueller’s final report.
Yet for all the happiness in Trump world that he and his family feel vindicated for the lack of further indictments, the as-yet publicly unseen report could yet pose political–if not criminal–woes for Trump.
That’s according to prominent Washington journalists who have been following the story since Mueller’s investigation began two years ago in the wake of Trump’s controversial firing of FBI Director James Comey.

Mueller and his team’s core mission was to probe whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 campaign to tilt the election to Trump– as well as any subsequent obstruction of justice.
The announcement Friday evening that Mueller handed in a final report to Attorney General William “Bill” Barr signalled the end to that effort.
Trump and the White House team “are responding to this news there are no new indictments in this Mueller report with a fair amount of glee,” CNN correspondent Jim Acosta reported Friday. “I talked to a Trump campaign advisor earlier this evening who said this was a great day for America and we won. That’s how they feel right now.”
Yet Acosta and others warned Trump not to get overconfident yet about the outcome. Although the Mueller report is not public, congressional Democrats and others are calling loudly for its full and complete public release.
‘There could be information in there that may well be negative information for the president,” Acosta added. “So they’re going to have to deal with the fall out of that. But at this point it’s not exactly clear what the steps are.”
Whatever the ultimate outcome of the Mueller report, Trump and his associates face a number of other federal and state criminal investigations on several fronts.
Meanwhile, referring to Trump’s oft-used slur against the Mueller probe as a “witch hunt,” NBC national security correspondent Ken Dilanian noted that Mueller “caught a lot of witches.”

In all, seven people pleaded guilty or were found guilty of crimes, while 27 individuals and three Russian firms were indicted as a result of the Mueller probe.
“It’s a remarkable record. It is much more than we could have anticipated at the beginning of this investigation,” Dilanian said. “Not only the vast expanse of charges against Russians and laying out in speaking indictments how the Russians attacked our electoral system, but indictments of people very close to the president. The campaign chairman, his personal lawyer. So in that respect, it has been a very significant investigation that will go down in history.
“At the same time, many people will be surprised that no one — no member of the Trump campaign, no one around Donald Trump has been charged with conspiring with that Russian election interference effort,” he allowed. “We have to wait to see what the report says about all of these suspicious contacts with the Russians, about whether Donald Trump was warned by the FBI, as we’ve reported, and what he did with those warnings, how he behaved and how Robert Mueller evaluates that behavior. That’s, I think, the missing piece here that we’re just going to have to wait to see what the report says.”

544,"Even Before The Mueller Report Landed, Prediction of ‘Indictments in This President’s Future’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/even-before-the-mueller-report-landed-prediction-of-indictments-in-this-presidents-future/,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller dropped a Friday evening political bombshell that he had finished the long-awaited final report on the two-year investigation into potential collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia, in order to tilt the election to Trump.
The final report, which marks the completion of the investigation as a whole, is now in the hands of Attorney General William “Bill” Barr.
However, as word of Mueller’s report spread, Democrats across the spectrum began speaking as with one voice, demanding the full and public release of the report — while warning against allowing any “sneak preview” for Donald Trump.
“Now that Special Counsel Mueller has submitted his report to the Attorney General, it is imperative for Mr. Barr to make the full report public and provide its underlying documentation and findings to Congress,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a joint statement. “Attorney General Barr must not give President Trump, his lawyers or his staff any ‘sneak preview’ of Special Counsel Mueller’s findings or evidence, and the White House must not be allowed to interfere in decisions about what parts of those findings or evidence are made public.

“The Special Counsel’s investigation focused on questions that go to the integrity of our democracy itself: whether foreign powers corruptly interfered in our elections, and whether unlawful means were used to hinder that investigation,” Pelosi and Schumer added. “The American people have a right to the truth. The watchword is transparency.”
Although Mueller and his team completed their probe without additional indictments–signaling that Trump and his family avoided criminal charges as a result of Mueller’s work–none of them should breathe too freely.
Trump, his various family members, and some within his private business remain the focus of multiple federal and state probes.
Federal and state investigators continue to drill into Trump’s hush-money payoffs to women with whom he had alleged affairs, as well as his business dealings, his inauguration spending and more.
“There are indictments in this president’s future. They’re coming,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a former state attorney general, said prior to the release of the report. “Whether they’re after his presidency or during it, obviously the Department of Justice has said you cannot indict a sitting president.”

545,The Housing Recession Washington D.C. Has Created,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/the-housing-recession-washington-dc-has-created/,"A few months ago, the Wall Street Journal published an article titled “The U.S. Housing Market Boom is Coming to an End, Starting in Dallas.” And yes, we have all heard about the rising interest rates and housing prices are to blame.
There is another factor that is hurting the housing market that has not been focused on and that is Washington D.C. Our nation’s leaders are elected to solve, not create, problems. Yet, on a bipartisan basis, we see manifestations of their self-serving vitriol. Given their irresponsible remarks, it’s understandable that the public should be overly cautious, even to the point of imprudence, in their financial affairs when their representatives sound as if our Republic’s survival is continuously at risk. They have created a mental recession based on fear and the housing market is the recipient of their behavior.
Those of us in the trenches, get first-hand reactions from potential buyers. With consumer confidence at an all-time high, why the hesitation? This is a mental recession, one that is being created because of the dysfunction in Washington D.C.

Allow me to be blunt — the perceived headwinds in the housing market are not rising interest rates or supply and demand, it is our politicians. It’s the Democrats screaming, “Impeach Trump!”, the Republicans responding with accusations, lies, and hypocrisy. Hearing this over and over has allowed uncertainty to set up shop in America’s psyche. Americans are acting as if they are afraid, and that fear is emotionally paralyzing. We are dominated by emotions and those emotions determine the market. We have all known that the Fed’s quantitative easing was going to stop, and the cheap money would come to an end. Washington blaming the housing recession on this is like blaming McDonald’s for being overweight.
Everything starts with perception. Politicians are rewarded with headlines when they act as verbal flamethrowers. Accordingly, fear has crept into our mindset. Although there are no indicators pointing to an economic slowdown, the public is acting as if the existing, robust economy should be suspect. Optimism is the secret to selling and, like common sense, it has left the building.
Unfortunately, Washington D.C. is in the remedial learning group and over the next few years, the threatening and flame throwing is going to get worse. Even more, unfortunately, these political flamethrowers are insulated from what their words are doing to our economy especially the housing market. Whether you like Trump or not, does not matter. People have enjoyed the gains in their retirement accounts, portfolios, and businesses. They are afraid they might lose them with all this impeachment talk.
On a positive note, we are beginning to understand the phenomenon of perceiving market drops like the one in 2008 not as a disaster but as a cycle, with opportunities built in. We are becoming accustomed to seeing the housing market act like the stock market. The first time the Dow dropped 300 points, it was headline news. Now, we don’t throw up our hands in despair when we see swings. We don’t see them as devastating crashes any longer. We’re seeing our economy – including the housing market – behave like the commodities market, just not as severe: rallying and dropping, based on supply and demand.

Sure, some of us are disgusted with the behavior in Washington DC. But wait six to eight months, when the dust begins to settle, and we become accustomed to the name-calling, accusations, probes, investigations, and flame-throwing. We forget how shocked we once were over announcements of a new round of political shenanigans. Just as Washington D.C. rhetoric rumbles, rises, and dies down, so does the volatility of the stock market, commodities market, and the housing market.
We are learning from our new norm, accepting it, and acting on it. Washington DC’s behavior is not the downfall of our economy. That’s why I feel confident that the current housing slump will be past history – sooner than expected, I predict. And the folks who bought homes in 2019 will be bragging about it in 2022. Not only will they profit from their buys, but they’ll also be looked upon as the smart people in real estate.
So, what’s the reality surrounding the real estate market? Sell on optimism and buy on pessimism!

546,House Democrats Building an ‘Ironclad’ Voting Rights Act,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/house-democrats-building-an-ironclad-voting-rights-act/,"House Democrats are working methodically to craft a new version of the Voting Rights Act that could survive any future challenge of the law at the Supreme Court, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
House Democrats are developing this new version of the Voting Rights Act–known as H.R. 4, The Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019–with the desire to curb the outbreak and pattern of voter suppression which have plagued elections for the past several years, Pelosi said this week at a press conference to describe and call attention to the new legislation.
“It’s almost criminal what’s going on across the country – whether it’s vote opportunities for Native Americans in North Dakota … get out of Dodge in order to vote in Kansas, they moved the polling place out of town,” Pelosi said.
“You saw what happened in Georgia, North Carolina, it goes on and on,” the speaker added, ticking off additional locations of pervasive voter suppression allegations.
This new legislation would be the first reauthorization or amendment to the original Voting Rights Act since 2006.
The original Voting Rights Act was signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon Johnson, at the height of the Civil Rights movement, so as to enforce the voting rights guaranteed in the US Constitution to racial minorities–including African Americans–particularly in the South where voting discrimination had been most rampant.

In the following decades, Congress would revisit the Voting Rights Act five times, to further expand the protection it offers.
The law consists of several provisions, including Section 5, which requires certain state and local governments to obtain what is known as federal “preclearance” before implementing any changes to their voting laws or practices; and Section 4(b), which provides a formula that determines which jurisdictions are subjected to preclearance based on their histories of discrimination in voting.
However, in the 2013 case Shelby v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down Section 4b, the preclearance coverage formula, saying that it was 40 years old and therefore a burden on affected jurisdictions. The court left Section 5 to stand but, without the coverage formula in Section 4b, Section 5 cannot be enforced.
Since the high court rendered its decision in Shelby, some 1,000 polling places were closed, purges of voter rolls, enactment of stringent voter ID laws and more, mostly undertaken by Republican officials. The net effect is that it has made voting more difficult, according to many critics.
That’s where the careful preparations of House Democrats come in, as to H.R. 4, their new version of the Voting Rights Act, according to Pelosi.
“The reason we didn’t just pass the Voting Rights Act, H.R. 4, the other day is because we are making sure we have hearings all over the country that our basis is ironclad as far as the courts are concerned because if you don’t want to have an openness is our electoral process, any excuse will do,” she said. “And we don’t want to give them any excuse not to uphold the next version.”
That includes congressional field hearings held outside of Washington DC in order to gather the information necessary.

Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) is leading that effort as chairwoman of the House Administration Committee’s elections subcommittee. The subcommittee held its first field hearing in Brownsville, Tex., where officials are purging voter rolls, Pelosi said.
“They just purged your name if you had a Hispanic surname,” Pelosi said. “It’s really, again, almost criminal what they are doing there, and we’ll have recourse there.”
Additional such hearings are expected, “going all around the country, as well in D.C., to make our basis for Title 4 – Title 4 of the Voting Rights Act is what the courts stripped – and so to make it ironclad,” Pelosi said.

547,Punching at a Ghost: Their ‘History’ Provides Window Into Trump’s Continued Feud With McCain After Death,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/punching-at-a-ghost-their-history-provides-window-into-trumps-continued-feud-with-mccain-after-death/,"Donald Trump reignited a firestorm Wednesday, as he took aim once more at one of his favorite foils of his political life: Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
Trump’s invective against McCain date back at least to the 2016 presidential campaign, when Trump disagreed that McCain ought to be considered a war hero for his service during the Vietnam War, saying, instead, that he preferred those “who weren’t captured.”
This time, however, Trump’s attack from the presidential podium took place months after McCain’s death from brain cancer.
While some, from across the political spectrum, rose up against Trump in indignation others saw reason behind Trump’s barbs hurled at a dead man.
The president began by criticizing McCain’s role in spurring–and then continuing–US military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq beginning during the administration of George W Bush.

Then the criticism became more personal, as Trump said his role in facilitating McCain’s elaborate multi-day memorial and funeral services last year went unacknowledged.
Trump, pointedly, had been disinvited at any of McCain’s memorial events, while Bush and former president Barack Obama both were requested to give eulogies.
“I endorsed him at his request and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which, as president, I had to approve,” Trump said. “I don’t care about this. I didn’t get a thank you. That is okay. We sent him on the way, but I was not a fan of John McCain.”
While others complained about the comments, some observers saw personal, and even political, benefits for Trump.
“There is a reason for those nasty remarks, there is a history between those two men,” said Lou Dobbs, a fervent Trump supporter and host on the Fox Business network. “And people who are attacking–including [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell–attacking the president for his views on John McCain is asinine.”
MSNBC host Chuck Todd said that Trump would actually score points for going this round with McCain, even post-mortem.
“There is part of the Trump base, I don’t know what else to call it, that just wants to make liberals cry, that just wanted to ‘own the libs,’ that that is all the Trump candidacy is for these folks, but I come across these folks that love it,” Todd said during one segment. “They don’t lament it, they love it.”

Former Pennsylvania senator and GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum seemed to try have it both ways during an interview on CNN, before he ultimately chalked this latest jab against McCain up as just one more turn for Trump in the ongoing investigation into ties between his 2016 campaign and the Russian government, as well as the so-called Steele dossier, which was assembled during the 2016 and later published, revealing many salacious allegations against Trump.
“It is vile behavior,” Santorum began, before adding, “But let’s just — you know, the bottom line here, this is about the sealed dossier, about the revelations that came out over the weekend that further implicated John McCain and his team of promoting the Steele dossier, which in the president’s mind, believes this is the reason for the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] warrants and ultimately for this Russia investigation.
“So this is him doing to John McCain what he did to [former attorney general] Jeff Sessions, which is someone who he believes is implicated in causing the biggest noose around his neck, if you will, when it comes to his presidency, which is just the constant harangue of this investigation, which is obviously impeded his presidency.”

548,"Rep. Tlaib: Pelosi Not Thrilled With Medicare-for-all and Green New Deal, But Tells Those Who Are Not To Back Down",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/rep-tlaib-pelosi-not-thrilled-with-medicare-for-all-and-green-new-deal-but-tells-those-who-are-not-to-back-down/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is not really very supportive of two of the biggest progressive reforms being developed in Congress, but what Pelosi is supporting are the lawmakers who want to see those proposed reforms become law, according one of a group of high-profile first-term female members of the House.
Pelosi apparently is not an enthusiastic backer of either Medicare-for-all, which is a single-payer proposal to reach a more universal level of national health coverage, while the “Green New Deal” being proposed by many Democrats as a comprehensive approach to address the challenge of global climate change, according to Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich), one of a handful of young female first-term members associated with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).
“You know what she says to me? ‘You have to represent your district.’ She says that to every new member: ‘Represent your district.’ She has never asked me to back down on any issue,” Tlaib said of Pelosi.
“I mean, what’s incredible is like, even if she’s not jumping up and down about Medicare for All, we’re still proceeding with Medicare for All. Is she endorsing Green New Deal? No, but that hasn’t stopped us.”
Pelosi, who was also speaker nearly a decade ago when the House approved its first landmark bill on climate change, seems at least pleased with the spirit of the Green New Deal.

“I do want to salute the Green [New] Deal in this respect — not the particulars because we have to take it one at a time, but in the respect of, again, raising the profile, the issue, which is a challenge generationally to preserve this planet,” Pelosi said.
As for Medicare-for-all–the idea of essentially opening Medicare coverage to all Americans–Pelosi has articulated more specific concerns, particularly in relation to the healthcare reform she helped enact with President Barack Obama, known as the Affordable Care Act.
“When they say Medicare for All, people have to understand this: Medicare for All is not as good a benefit as the Affordable Care Act,” she told Rolling Stone. “It doesn’t have catastrophic [coverage] — you have to go buy it. It doesn’t have dental. It’s not as good as the plans that you can buy under the Affordable Care Act. So I say to them, come in with your ideas, but understand that we’re either gonna have to improve Medicare — for all, including seniors — or else people are not gonna get what they think they’re gonna get. And by the way, how’s it gonna be paid for?”

549,"The New GOP Answer to Climate Change: It Exists, But Just Rely on ‘Innovation,’ Nuclear To Save The Day",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-new-gop-answer-to-climate-change-it-exists-but-just-rely-on-innovation-nuclear-to-save-the-day/,"Under apparent pressure from Democrats’ sharpened focus on climate change as a top-line issue, their proposed expansive “Green New Deal” to address the matter, and likely the early early impacts of climate change themselves on worsening weather, Republicans increasingly have had to address an issue that not long ago, often dismissed out-of-hand.
Speaking before an audience in Canada recently, former president Barack Obama noted how a Republican senator not long ago actually held up a snowball on the floor of the Senate and said, “Look there’s no global warming because it’s cold outside.”
It’s becoming increasingly impossible for such denialism to continue to hold weight when people clearly are beginning to see the effects of climate change for themselves.
“Just listen to Mother Nature, and the climate-related extreme weather events have quadrupled in recent years,” said former vice president Al Gore, the Nobel Prize-winning climate activist. “Here in the U.S. alone in less than nine years we’ve had 17 once-in-a-thousand-year events, and they keep on coming, and they keep on getting worse. So, the old strategy of trying to fool people into disbelieving the evidence in front of their own eyes is failing.”
Republicans seem to have had to switch gears quickly. With the Democrats directly challenging them on the climate issue and putting forward an ambitious and government-intensive program dubbed the “Green New Deal,” backed by many of the party’s leading presidential hopefuls, Republicans no longer can ignore the problem by effectively throwing up their hands, saying, “No one really knows for sure if climate change is real.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently took to the Senate floor to directly challenge Republicans to acknowledge the reality of climate change, and to participate in enacting effective solutions.
Schumer and more than 20 of his Senate Democratic colleagues followed that up with a letter to the business-friendly US Chamber of Commerce which has a history of paying big money to lobby against comprehensive climate change measures for fear of the additional burden it would place on its corporate membership.

“It is time that we put aside our differences and start working to take real actions on climate change because the American people and American businesses can no longer afford inaction,” the senators wrote. “We believe the time has come for the Chamber to act on behalf of its members who support and stand to benefit from a transition to a clean energy economy.”
The letter hasn’t prompted any consensus. Rather, Republicans have had to essentially admit climate change is real but simultaneously run a furious campaign against the “Green New Deal,” which is a massive resolution to get the United States off of fossil fuels and toward clean energy to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Republicans are ominously warning that, okay, climate change is real, but the Green New Deal will just be too much, and somehow wreck the US economy.
“The truth is this proposal is a raw deal for America, especially our rural communities,” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said on the Senate floor. “As many of you know, every month I give out a squeal award, which draws attention to outrageous examples of wasteful and reckless spending of taxpayer money. With $93 trillion — ‘t,’ with a ‘t’ — trillion dollar price tag, which is roughly $10 trillion more than the entire recorded spending of the United States government since 1789.”
Republicans make it sound even scarier by somehow breaking that down to pin $65,000 annually on every US household to pay for it.
Instead, Republicans want Americans to reject what they also dub the “nightmare” Green New Deal and instead pin all of their hope on some gauzy promise it will all go away if only Americans trust the “innovation” of unrestrained industry, as seen in this Republican video:
For Republicans like Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming this “innovation” means hoping for results from several largely yet-unproven technologies which may or may not pan out until sometime in the future–as well as an excuse to try to bring back nuclear power.
“Promising new technologies like advanced nuclear power, carbon capture, and carbon utilization hold the key to significant emissions reductions,” said Barrasso, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. “We can lower our emissions without crashing our economy.”
Barrasso sees climate change as an excuse to particularly push nuclear power, touting the fact that in January, Donald Trump signed Barrasso’s legislation, the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act.

It looks like another Republican plan to prop up another industry.
And there’s the fact that the whole Republican knock on the Green New Deal–this supposedly “nightmare” $93 trillion price tag–is just made up.
It was quickly debunked by the non-partisan fact checkers, PolitiFact, which called the $93 trillion figure “flabby,” and noting that the Green New Deal has not received a cost score from the “gold-standard” and non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.
And then Republicans just don’t match the Democrats’ obvious energy and commitment to the climate change issue, according to Republican John Kasich, a former Ohio governor and congressman.
“When [Trump] has 13 government agencies and even the military preparing for something that involves bad impacts of climate change, I mean, it’s silly. And I’ll tell you a little message to the Republicans,” Kasich said. “The Democrats, you may not like what they have, okay, but they have energy. I was down at the South by Southwest Festival. They’ve got energy. Where is the Republican energy? It seems to be against rather than for. Ideas are what changes the world and I see an absence of them from my former colleagues.”

550,"In The Wake of Nunes Suit, Trump Sees ‘Collusion’ Between Social Media, Democrats",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/in-the-wake-of-nunes-suit-trump-sees-collusion-between-social-media-democrats/,"In the wake of Rep. Devin Nunes’ $250 million lawsuit against Twitter and three of its users, Donald Trump is backing up his California Republican ally by saying that Twitter and other social media are in “collusion” with Democrats.
This new face-off between conservatives and social media providers could spark renewed interest, among Republicans, in the regulation of social media content.
“I get to see firsthand what’s going on, and it is not good. And we use the word collusion very loosely all the time,” Trump said, referring to the ongoing special counsel investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
“And I will tell you there is collusion with respect to that, because something has to be going on,” Trump added, referring to allegations that social media providers collude with Democrats for political purposes.
Nunes, who as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee until Democrats took House control, has been a key Trump ally, particularly as it related to the committee’s own probe into alleged Trump campaign involvement with the Russians.

The Nunes lawsuit says Twitter and the three specific users who are party to the suit defamed Nunes and interfered with his work on the Russia investigation and his re-election.
“And when you get the back scene, back office statements made by executives of the various companies and you see the level of in many cases hatred that they have for a certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election, you say that’s really unfair,” Trump continued. “So, something is happening with those groups of folks that are running Facebook, and Google, and Twitter. And I do think we have to get the bottom of it. It’s very fair. It’s collusive and it’s very, very, fair to say that we have to — we have to do something about it.”
Former Arkansas governor, GOP presidential candidate and father of Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders, described a rationale for regulations.

“They may claim to be a private company, they may, and in fact be one, but they’ve become a public utility,” Huckabee said during a Fox News segment. “Here’s the big question, if they use the power of their utility to change the votes of people–to actually become a political arm–don’t they have to file political expenditure requirements? Aren’t they going to have to do that because if they are playing politics, they’ve got to live by the rules of politics and that is you have to disclose your contributions. They are in essence a contributing force to the Democratic Party and a contributing force against Republicans.
“So if they’re going to do that, then either own up to it and play big boy ball which means you file all the reports or else let them be governed by the government, which most of us don’t think we want the government involved. What we want is a company with integrity and they don’t have it right now,” he added.

551,Intelligence Committee Member Swalwell: The American People Will See The Mueller Report,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/intelligence-committee-member-swalwell-the-american-people-will-see-the-mueller-report/,"Special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report, whenever it should be completed, has become Washington’s latest political hot potato: Just who will get to see it, and when? And does that include us, the American people?
The latest toss came this week, as the White House said it might try to grab first dibs on the report, claiming executive privilege.
The report will wrap up what has become an incredibly thorough investigation, and hopefully, will answer definitely whether Donald Trump’s presidential campaign colluded with the Russian government to tilt the 2016 election toward a Trump victory.
Also this week, however, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee stated resolutely that, yes, the American public will see the full Mueller final report.

“You know, I spent the last two years with many of my colleagues going across the country as people marched in the streets, went to town halls, and went to the ballot box to make sure that we could see this report,” said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif).
“So I’m going to fight like hell to make sure we see this report, whether it’s organizing again, whether it’s using my lungs, you know, whether it’s outmaneuvering with our minds. The American people are going to see this report,” SwalwelI guaranteed.
“If we had not won the House, I wouldn’t say that so confidently to you, but the American people will see every word of this report,” he added.

552,Gillibrand: ‘Immigration Is Not A Security Issue’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/gillibrand-immigration-is-not-a-security-issue/,"Even as Donald Trump fights with Congress over authority to build a wall along the southern border so as to further stem immigrants from entering the United States, at least one Democrat who would replace Trump in the Oval Office has a very different view.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, one of 15 Democrats currently contending for the Democratic nomination for president, doesn’t see immigration as a security issue.
“I believe that immigration has always been a strength of this country. Our country was largely founded by immigrants and largely built by immigrants. Our diversity has always been our strength,” said Gillibrand, who a decade ago replaced Hillary Clinton in the Senate, when Clinton joined the Obama administration as secretary of state.
“It’s what creates entrepreneurism and innovation across America for our entire history and in our best moments, we have not been afraid of immigrants. In our worst moments we have,” Gillibrand added. “We have a Statue of Liberty with the beacon of hope, send us your tired and hungry, your huddled masses. She stands for something. This country, in its best moments welcomed immigrants and this is not what we are seeing from the president today.”

Trump has been extremely aggressive on enforcement at the border with Mexico, terming the situation there a “crisis,” despite the fact that apprehensions by federal authorities are way down from a high in 2000.
Aside from his wall project, Trump last year ordered a policy in which border authorities forcibly separated migrant children from their parents. According to reports, some of those migrant children still have not been returned to their parents.
“What he has done on the border is inhumane and intolerable, separating children from parents, mothers from babies, and locking up people in facilities that are run by for-profit prison companies. It’s an outrage. I would get rid of all of that,” Gillibrand said. “That should not be under [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. It should not be under [the Department of] Homeland Security. Immigration is not a security issue. It is an economic and a humanitarian, and a family — There is no such thing as an illegal human.
“I believe we have to fundamentally transform how we treat people seeking asylum and refuge and in my state, and I know in your state, you have immigrant populations across the state,” Gillibrand told a member of the audience at televised town hall appearance.
“Refugee populations that make your economy stronger, that make your city and states stronger, that make this country stronger. We should not be afraid of refugees and asylum seekers and mothers and babies seeking our help,” Gillibrand concluded.

553,"Veteran Journo Koppel Takes on The Press: NYT, WaPo Have Decided Trump Is ‘Bad’ For US",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/veteran-journo-koppel-takes-on-the-press-nyt-wapo-have-decided-trump-is-bad-for-us/,"While not using Donald Trump’s more vitriolic rhetoric, veteran TV anchor and journalist Ted Koppel surprisingly is sounding much the same theme when it comes to today’s press, particularly the contemporary editions of The New York Times and The Washington Post.
“I’m terribly concerned that when you talk about The New York Times these days, when you talk about The Washington Post these days, we’re not talking about The New York Times of 50 years ago,” said Koppel, who rose to prominence four decades ago, running a nightly report on ABC of the American hostage crisis in Iran which later would become the highly watched newsmagazine program, Nightline, until its cancellation in 2005. Presently, Koppel is credited as a contributor to the CBS News Sunday morning program. In his career, Koppel has won many awards, including a number of Emmy Awards.
“We are not talking about The Washington Post of 50 years ago. We’re talking about organizations that I believe have, in fact, decided as organizations that Donald J. Trump is bad for the United States,” Koppel continued. “We have things appearing on the front page of The New York Times right now that never would have appeared 50 years ago. Analysis, commentary on the front page.
“I remember sitting at the breakfast table with my wife during the campaign after the Access Hollywood tape came out and The New York Times — and I will not offend any of you here by using the language, but you know exactly what words were used and they were spelled out on the front page of The New York Times. I turned to my wife and I said The Times is absolutely committed to making sure that this guy does not get elected.

“So his perception that the establishment press is out to get him doesn’t mean that great journalism is not being done. It is,” Koppel allowed. “But the notion that most of us look upon Donald Trump as being an absolute fiasco, he’s not mistaken in that perception and he’s not mistaken when so many of the liberal media, for example, described themselves as belonging to the resistance. What does that mean?”

554,"Top Dems Press For Probes of Shadowy Woman, ‘Cindy’ Yang, in Trump’s Orbit",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/law/top-dems-press-for-probes-of-shadowy-woman-cindy-yang-in-trumps-orbit/,"Top Democrats in both the House and Senate are seeking criminal and national security investigations into a shadowy woman who is tied to prostitution, human trafficking, and apparently has been selling access to Donald Trump to foreign nationals.
The woman’s name is Li “Cindy” Yang, and according to reports cited in a letter written by several top Democratic lawmakers, Yang operated message parlors in Florida which used immigrant women as sex workers.
In addition, Yang apparently also operates an enterprise which seemingly is selling access to Trump, to Chinese national businessmen.

On Yang’s company website, since taken down, she offers the opportunity to meet with the president and other top administration officials. On at one occasion, in 2017, Yang arranged for Chinese businessmen to meet with Trump at a New York fundraiser.
Yang also is a frequent guest at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, attended 2019 Super Bowl party with Trump and has visited the White House at least once, the lawmakers said.
“If true, these allegations raise serious counterintelligence concerns,” the lawmakers wrote. “China has frequently used non-traditional intelligence collectors and businesspersons to compromise targets.”
The letter to the directors of the FBI, national intelligence agencies, and Secret Service requesting criminal and counterintelligence investigations of Yang was signed by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner and Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein.
Following the release of the letter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer released a joint statement: “The facts in this situation are very concerning, and we urge [FBI] Director [Christopher] Wray to adhere to the joint bicameral requests of the Democratic Senate ranking members and Democratic House chairmen and start an investigation.”

555,Fox News’ Wallace Outlines Trump’s 2020 Path: The Base Alone Won’t Be Enough, It Will Be Crucial To Paint Dem As ‘Socialist’,The BiPartisan Press,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/fox-news-wallace-outlines-trumps-2020-path-the-base-alone-wont-be-enough-it-will-be-crucial-to-paint-dem-as-socialist/,"While Donald Trump has been extraordinarily attentive to his political base of supporters, they alone will not carry him to a second term, according to Fox News journalist and commentator Chris Wallace.
“You can’t do it, because there are just not enough votes in the base. It appears that from most of the polling that 35, 40 percent of eligible voters are what you would call ever Trumpers, solid red core Trump supporters,” Wallace said. “That’s not enough to win an election. So he’s going to have to expand his base. And one of the things that a lot of political experts have been wondering about is — the president seems to have a lot of leeway with the base.”
Unlike many other Fox hosts, Wallace is seen as a much more non-partisan political observer and analyst.
Wallace acknowledged that Trump’s 2016 campaign promise that Mexico would pay for a wall along the border between the two nations has been “largely dispensed with now and it doesn’t seems to have bothered his base as long as he keeps faith on the idea of building the wall.”

Trump is in the midst of trying to construct that wall using military funds, having declared a “state of emergency” at the southern US border.
But even with his loyal base, it’s not enough, Wallace said.
“You got to expand it to independents. You have to expand it to suburban Republicans, suburban women, persuadable Democrats,” Wallace added.
Many of those constituencies Wallace said Trump needs to attract fled the Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections, causing the US House to flip to Democratic control.
Trump would have to find a way to bring those groups back into the GOP fold.
“You look where he won in 2016, in the suburbs, in the so-called blue wall of upper Rust Belt states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. You can’t just do it with the base. You’re going to have to expand,” Wallace said.
Although Trump won Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in 2016, contributing to his Electoral College success, he won those states narrowly with a combined margin under 100,000 voters.

Ultimately, Wallace said, Trump is going to have to portray whomever becomes his opponent as the Democratic nominee as unpalatable and unacceptable.
“One of the things I think he’s counting on is that he’s either going to be able to portray or the Democrats in fact will nominate someone who is so far to the left, the president would say a socialist, that it’s going to make it easier for him,” Wallace said. “He doesn’t have to pivot as far to the center because he’ll say the Democrats have moved so far to their extreme left.”

556,Sen. Kaine: Pentagon Hiding Those Military Projects Trump Would ‘Ransack’ To Win Override Vote,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/sen-kaine-pentagon-hiding-those-military-projects-trump-would-ransack-to-win-override-vote/,"The acting secretary of defense is refusing a direct request to reveal which military budgets Donald Trump would “ransack” in order to build the wall Trump wants on the southern border, said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.).
Kaine, the Democrats’ 2016 vice presidential nominee, said he asked Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to reveal which specific military projects would be impacted by Trump’s decision to use his powers under a declaration of a “state of emergency” in order to bypass Congress and essentially raid the military budget as funding for his long-sought border wall.
“I’m on the [Senate] Armed services committee. I represent Virginia. I have a child in the military. So I sent a letter on February 15th to the secretary of defense and said, ‘If you’re going to ransack the Pentagon’s budget, tell me what projects you’re going to cut or delay or eliminate.’ They wouldn’t provide an answer,” Kaine said Sunday during a segment of the CBS News program “Face The Nation.”
Congress responded to Trump’s “emergency” declaration by passing a resolution of disapproval to cancel that “state of emergency,” a resolution which Trump has now vetoed. Congress has now set up an attempt to override Trump’s veto.

“At the hearing on Thursday, we’re now going to vote that day on whether we support or reject the emergency declaration, and they still hadn’t answered our question: What projects are at stake?
“At the hearing [Shanahan] said, ‘Oh, I’ll send you the list later this afternoon,’ and you’re right, I kind of blew up at him,” Kaine said. “You’re going to give us the list after we vote? This is highly relevant to the vote about the president’s emergency declaration. What projects are you going to ransack out of the Pentagon budget? Is it going to be military housing? Is it going to be trying to make our bases safer from terrorism with construction projects? Is it going to be rebuilding the air force base that got blitzed in the hurricanes last fall? And they said they would give us the list after, but to add insult to injury, they had to walk that back.
“They don’t even want to give us the list now at all because we’re going to have to have an override vote. I don’t think the White House wants us to see the list before the override vote,” Kaine added.
If a specific list of military projects impacted by Trump’s “emergency” declaration were to become public, that could cause more congressional Republicans to turn against Trump’s “emergency,” and increase the potential that his veto could be overriden stopping his “emergency” and any immediate plans for wall construction to be stopped dead.

Omar Under Another Attack, And This Time It’s Too Much Even For Fox News",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/rep-omar-under-another-attack-and-this-time-its-too-much-even-for-fox-news/,"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.)–the freshman lawmaker who has been defending herself for several weeks for controversial comments some have have interpreted as anti-Semitic–finds herself in the center of another storm.
But this time, the Muslim member who wears a hijab on the House floor, is the undisputed victim.
As Omar was preaching a message of love and inclusion during a segment of CNN, a popular host on rival Fox News savagely attacked Omar’s patriotism and found herself pulled from the Fox News Saturday night schedule.

Omar was on CNN reacting to the deadly mosque attacks in New Zealand, which had been carried out in the name of white supremacism and anti-immigrant hatred.
“Love trumps hate. So we just have to make sure that we are resilient, loving and that we’re creating an environment that recognizes all of our worth,” Omar said.
However, over on Fox News, host Jeanine Pirro suggested on-air Omar was not a loyal American and did not support the US Constitution because of her faith and that she wears a hijab.
That proved too much even for Fox News, where the hosts often traffic in such righist rhetoric.
The network pulled Pirro’s show and issued this statement: “We strongly condemn Jeanine Pirro’s comments about Rep. Ilhan Omar. They do not reflect those of the network and we have addressed the matter with her.”

Pulling Pirro off the air prompted one of Donald Trump’s usual fierce tweetstorms.
“Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct, which will only bring you down,” Trump said in one tweet, before advising readers to “Be strong & prosper, be weak & die!”

558,"Post-New Zealand, Trump Must Cool His Rhetoric, Fmr. GOP Congressman Says",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/post-new-zealand-trump-must-cool-his-rhetoric-fmr-gop-congressman-says/,"Donald Trump must curb his harsh and divisive speech in the wake of this week’s tragic deadly mosque attacks in New Zealand, according to a former moderate Republican member of Congress.
Some 49 were left dead after terrorists attacked mosques in the New Zealand city of Christhurch. The rampage reportedly was spurred by white supremacist terrorists hateful of immigration.
The attack has led many to seek root causes and end the influences fueling such hate–both within the United States and globally.

“Maybe we need to hear a little less from the president in terms of his rather incendiary, inflammatory rhetoric on racial or ethnic matters,” said former Rep. Charlie Dent, who had become a prominent moderate voice in Congress when he represented his Pennsylvania district from 2005 until his resignation in 2018.
“I think that has been very destructive for the country. We saw it in Charlottesville, we heard the comments about Mexicans being rapists and the judge from Indiana who is a Mexican,” Dent added, referring to a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., which turned deadly, after which Trump defended both sides, including the neo-Nazis.
“He made all kinds of comments over the years that have been very, very unhelpful, you know, the way he’s talked about Muslims in the past. So I think sometimes we need to hear the president talk in a more unifying way,” Dent added. “He likes to stoke things up, he likes to divide. I’m not blaming him for what happened in New Zealand, but at the same time, our leader are expected to engage in some rhetoric. They try to calm things down and not incite. You know, this horrible tragedy in New Zealand, it’s just unthinkable, somebody going to a place of worship on a Friday and murder or kill nearly 100 people, or injure nearly 100 people. It’s just horrific and leaders have to stand up and lead, and not be dividers.”
As it relates to the New Zealand massacre, Trump did make a brief statement.

“It’s a horrible thing. I saw it early in the morning when I looked at what was happening in New Zealand,” Trump said. “I just spoke, as you know, to the Prime Minister [of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern]. I think it’s a horrible, disgraceful thing and a horrible act.”

559,Student Confronts Chelsea Clinton Over NZ Attacks,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/student-confronts-chelsea-clinton-over-nz-attacks/,"A college student angrily confronted former US first daughter Chelsea Clinton today, directly blaming her recent condemnation of recent remarks made by US Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) for the terror attack in New Zealand.
The comments came at a memorial service in Christchurch, New Zealand that Clinton attended.
New Zealand was the site of a deadly rampage against mosques in the country which left 49 dead and many others wounded.

Omar recently made remarks which became controversial and some, including Chelsea Clinton, condemned as anti-Semitic.
“This, this right, here is the result of a massacre stoked by people like you and the words you put out,” the activist student told a clearly startled Clinton. “And I want you to know that and I want you to feel that deep inside, 49 people died because of the rhetoric you put out there.”
The student’s friend posted the video on Twitter, and then tweeted a follow-up, asking people to donate to her friend online. But after receiving an onslaught of criticism, she quickly deleted her account. The video she posted is above.
The activist remains unrepentant. On Twitter, she said that her “brand” is “yelling at white politicians.”
The student later re-tweeted a post from Rep. Omar, and then posted a message explaining her anger toward Chelsea Clinton.

Trump declared the emergency in order to bypass Congress and essentially raid military funding to build the wall he wants along the southern border.
Congress responded by passing a resolution of disapproval to put an end to Trump’s “emergency” move. Democrats, and some Republicans, object to Trump’s emergency declaration as a violation of the Constitution’s separation of powers, as well as Congress holding the power of the purse.
After Trump issued his veto, Pelosi immediately set March 26 as the day that the House will attempt to override the veto.
To do so will require a supermajority of two-thirds in both the House and Senate to successfully override the veto.
“The House and Senate resoundingly rejected the president’s lawless power grab, yet the president has chosen to continue to defy the Constitution, the Congress and the will of the American people,” Pelosi said.
When originally passed, the resolution of disapproval did so in neither the House nor Senate to guarantee overcoming the veto.

That means the resolution would have to draw additional support from among House Republicans to override the veto.
And that’s squarely where Pelosi is putting her pressure.
“House Republicans will have to choose between their partisan hypocrisy and their sacred oath to support and defend the Constitution,” she said.
Pelosi knows that she has majority public opinion on her side. Some 65 percent of Americans oppose Trump’s emergency declaration, while just 33 percent approve. That’s according to a Monmouth poll released this month.

561,Veto: Trump Calls Disapproval For His ‘Emergency’ A ‘Very Bad Thing’ For Republicans,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/veto-trump-calls-disapproval-for-his-emergency-a-very-bad-thing-for-republicans/,"Donald Trump issued the first veto of his presidency Friday, shooting down a resolution of disapproval which would have blocked his declaration of a “state of emergency.”
Trump’s emergency declaration pages the way for him to bypass Congress and use military funds to pay for the wall he wants along the southern border of the United States.
The Senate approved the resolution of disapproval Thursday, with 12 Republicans joining all Democratic senators in favor of disapproval.

Although both House and Senate passed the resolution, neither did so by margins large enough to override Trump’s veto.
“Yeah, nobody’s beaten up. I said, ‘Use your own discretion.’ But I think it’s a bad vote if they go against,” Trump said, ahead of the vote, of Senate Republicans who supported disapproval.
“I think anybody going against border security, drug trafficking, human trafficking, that’s a bad vote,” Trump added. “The Democrats are for open borders, they’re for crime. I mean, frankly, they’re for crime. These people can tell you that better than anyone. When you have open borders, when you don’t have walls, you know it very well, all of you folks know it very well, we deal with it all the time.
“I guess they think it’s good politically. I think it happens to be bad politically,” Trump continued. “I think it’s an 80 percent issue and maybe more than that. But the Democrats, in order to make things difficult, they offer open borders and they’re for crime. And the Republicans aren’t.
“But I told Republican senators, ‘Vote any way you want. Vote how you feel good.’ But I think it’s bad for a Republican senator,” Trump concluded. ‘I also think it’s bad for a Democrat senator to vote against border security and to vote against the wall. I think if they vote that way, it’s a very bad thing for them, long into the future.”
Trump’s fight to build his wall doesn’t end with the veto, as the “state of emergency” declaration is also being fought in the courts, including affected landowners where the wall would be built in Texas.

562,O’Rourke Endorses The ‘Green New Deal’: ‘The Future of the World Depends on Us’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/orourke-endorses-the-green-new-deal-the-future-of-the-world-depends-on-us/,"Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke is the latest Democratic presidential hopeful to sign on to the “Green New Deal,” an expansive plan to address climate change, as well as provide economic development. It was put forward by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).
O’Rourke, of El Paso, Tex., this week kicked off his presidential campaign at a televised event in the early presidential caucus state of Iowa.
O’Rourke said that he supported the “Green New Deal” when asked about it by an audience member at his Iowa event.

O’Rourke referred to the devastating superstorms like Hurricane Harvey which have ravaged his home state and are predicted to continue to do so. He also mentioned droughts which have gripped West Texas.
“At a town hall like this, I remember a young woman came in with her two children, she was skipping her son’s basketball practice to be there, she was going to talk to a Democrat even though she was a life-long Republican because she told me that what her grandparents planted on their farm, what her parents planted on their farm, that she is now trying to plant does not grow,” O’Rourke said. “She said, ‘Climate change, Beto, is not something that we have to prepare for, it is something that is here.’ Let us all be well aware that life is going to be a lot tougher for the generations that follow us no matter what we do. It is only a matter of degrees.”
The key to effectively controlling climate change effectively will be moving away from dependence on greenhouse gas emissions due to the use of fossil fuels.
The United States began to take on the challenge of climate change by signing on to the Paris Climate Accords during the Obama administration. However, once in office, Donald Trump has deemphasized climate change and took steps to withdraw the United States from those accords.

“And along this current trajectory, there will be people who can no longer live in the cities that they call home today. There is food grown in this country that will no longer prosper in these soils,” O’Rourke said of the effects of climate change. “There is going to be massive migration of tens or hundreds of millions of people from countries that are literally uninhabitable or under water that are above the sea right now. This is our final chance.
“The scientists are absolutely unanimous on this, that we have no more than 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis. My gratitude then for the young people who have stepped up to offer such a bold proposal, to meet such a grave challenge,” O’Rourke added. “They say that we should do nothing less than marshal every single resource in this country to meet that challenge, to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, to get to net zero emissions. Which means that not only must we emit less greenhouse gases, we must also plant those things that absorb greenhouse gases and carbon and we must invest in the technology that will allow us to clean some of it that’s in the air right now. Can we make it? I don’t know, it’s up to every single one of us.”

563,GOP On O’Rourke: Don’t Call Him ‘Beto’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/gop-on-orourke-dont-call-him-beto/,"Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke just jumped into the race for the Democratic nomination for president, but Republicans already are starting to settle on some strategies to take down the 46-year-old El Paso, Tex., native.
Indeed, the GOP appears to be taking early aim at O’Rourke in a way that the party hasn’t seemed to bother with, in regards to many of the other Democrats in the field.
National Republicans seem to be taking pages right out of the playbook Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) used to defeat O’Rourke in their matchup during the 2018 midterm elections.

First, and foremost, Republicans don’t want to call O’Rourke “Beto.”
Asked to respond to Beto O’Rourke’s nascent candidacy during a segment of Fox News, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley tried to correct anchor Bill Hemmer.
“Well, first of all, you pronounced it wrong. It’s Robert Francis. That’s number one,” Gidley said. “Number two, we don’t care who gets in the race. The fact is the president is going to win reelection.”
Hemmer ultimately replied, “Just to follow on that, you answered that question by calling him Robert Francis. Is that how the president will refer to him?”
“He has called him that before on the campaign trail,” Gidley responded. “And why wouldn’t he? That’s his name.”
Although he speaks fluent Spanish, there has never been any indication that the Caucasian, Irish-American O’Rourke has ever tried to claim any Latino heritage. “Beto” is simply a common nickname for Robert in the El Paso area, and was given to him at an early age by his family.
Still, by trying to define something as basic as O’Rourke’s name, Republicans clearly want to define him and his candidacy on their terms–not his own.
Attempting to remove the “Beto” appellation is a strategy Cruz first invoked during their contest. Cruz actually got called out for doing so, since “Ted” is not his accurate first name, either. It is Rafael.
Cruz turned his beef with the “Beto” moniker into a jingle, and said, “We had some fun with it.”
O’Rourke, himself, said he wasn’t going to worry too much about his name.

“I mean, I think if your opening salvo is to make fun of my first name then, you know, I’ll take that. It’s not even something that I even have to respond to,” he said during the 2018 campaign. “Folks across Texas are responding to that. They are sick of the small stuff and they want us to be big and I’m going to continue to follow the lead of people who ask us do that.”
Sen. Tom Cotton, a conservative Republican from Arkansas, and one of Donald Trump’s staunchest supporters in the Senate, doubled down on criticism of O’Rourke in remarks from the Senate floor.
Cotton referred to O’Rourke in his speech defending Trump’s declared “state of emergency” so as to bypass Congress and build the wall on the southern border that he has called for.
“The Democrats’ newest presidential aspirant, Robert Francis O’Rourke—a former congressman and failed Senate candidate–has even gone so far as to suggest tearing down existing barriers at the southern border, which I’m sure thrilled all the good people of El Paso who don’t live in a world of private planes and security details,” Cotton said.

564,"Jumping Into Field of ‘Amazing Candidates,’ O’Rourke Announces For President",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/jumping-into-field-of-amazing-candidates-orourke-announces-for-president/,"Acknowledging that he is joining a large, boisterous crowd of what he termed “so many amazing candidates running for president right now,” former Texas congressman and 2018 Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke became the latest contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Although he is one of a dozen or so Democrats in the race, O’Rourke was given something close to rock star treatment as he kicked off his nascent bid for the White House with an appearance in Keokuk, Iowa, which was carried live on television.
O’Rourke, who raised a large war-chest in his 2018 contest against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), ultimately lost that race but came closer than any Democrat in decades in winning a statewide election in the Lone Star State.
Since that performance, O’Rourke had been strongly encouraged by supporters nationwide to make the 2020 presidential race.
O’Rourke emphasized that he wanted a positive-oriented campaign, and sketched out just a handful of issues, including access to quality healthcare, addressing climate change, reproductive rights for women, potential Supreme Court reform and broadband access for all.

“This setting right now, the very first event of our campaign for president is an example not only of the way that I wish to campaign across this country for every single American, and I could care less your party persuasion, your religion, anything other than the fact that right now we are all Americans and we are all human beings,” O’Rourke said. “And we do everything within our power for one another, for this great country and for every generation that follows. …
“The government is all of us. That we hold each other accountable not just for what we promise and that what we enact or fail to enact but how we conduct ourselves on the campaign trail. Critically important that we not denigrate, or demean any other candidate. We don’t talk about their personal lives,” O’Rourke said to applause. “Any single Democrat running today — and I may not be able to enumerate every single one of them right now — would be far better than the current occupant of the White House.”
O’Rourke, in particular, generated attention from both the political press, and some late-night comedians for his mention of the Tinder dating app during his remarks on broadband access.
“In Texas, we have a problem with broadband in rural communities. You may have that in Iowa as well where farmers and ranchers and producers literally cannot get online, where people cannot start businesses in their hometown or finish their education after high school because they can’t get online,” O’Rourke said. “They can’t go to Tinder and find a date tonight to find that special person who is going to make the difference in their lives. I want to make sure every American has that opportunity.”
For instance, O’Rourke’s Tinder remark seemed to leave MSNBC reporter Garrett Haake absolutely giddy.
“He got asked a question about rural broadband. This is, like, the least sexy issue of all time for most people across the country,” Haake said. “But when he answered this question, he cracked a joke kind of on the side, well, if we can’t get this done, people won’t have Tinder to meet the love of their life. It was just a throwaway line, but do you think Donald Trump or Joe Biden can make a reference to a dating app in a stump speech? It was just one of those little, tiny moments that caught my attention. And I think that will be the kind of thing we’ll see play out if you get into a Beto/Biden kind of showdown later down the road.”

565,Fox Host to RNC Chair: ‘Get Rid of’ All Republicans Who Vote Down Trump’s Emergency Declaration,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/fox-host-to-rnc-chair-get-rid-of-all-republicans-who-vote-down-trumps-emergency-declaration/,"A Fox Business host who is well-known for his stalwart support of Donald Trump told the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee (RNC) to “get rid of” the Republican senators who vote to approve the resolution of disapproval which would cancel Trump’s declaration of “state of emergency.”
The Senate approved the resolution Thursday by a margin of 59 to 41, with 12 Republicans ultimately crossing over to block Trump’s “state of emergency,” by which Trump could bypass Congress in order to essentially raid military budgets to build the border wall he craves.
The border wall appears to be a key issue for both Trump and his base of supporters.
Democrats, and some Republicans, oppose Trump’s “state of emergency” on constitutional grounds as only Congress is supposed to have the power of the purse.

The Democratic-controlled House originated the resolution of disapproval and already approved it.
When the Senate approved the resolution, Trump immediately tweeted that he would veto the resolution.
Neither the House nor the Senate passed the resolution by margins large enough to override a veto. Still, the Senate result represented a rare rebuke of Trump by Senate Republicans.
During a segment prior to the vote, Fox Business host Lou Dobbs complained to RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel that “every senator who votes against this should absolutely be removed from office.
“I think the RNC should work to get rid of them because they’re standing in the way of a president who is the most successful in the first two years of his presidency since FDR. And it’s that straightforward,” Dobbs added.

566,Nadler: Fmr. Acting AG Whitaker ‘Did Not Deny’ Trump Called Him To Discuss Michael Cohen Case,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/nadler-fmr-acting-ag-whitaker-did-not-deny-trump-called-him-to-discuss-michael-cohen-case/,"Former acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker disclosed several key points related to Whitaker’s relationship with Donald Trump for the few months Whitaker served as the nation’s chief law enforcement officer, according to the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
Whitaker, who served as attorney general for the period between Jeff Sessions’ ouster and the swearing in of William “Bill” Barr last month. Whitaker subsequently left the Justice Department.
The House Judiciary Committee called Whitaker back to provide testimony under oath about his brief tenure.
“One, unlike in the hearing room, Mr. Whitaker did not deny that the president called him to discuss Michael Cohen, the Michael Cohen case, and personnel decisions in the southern district,” said the committee chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY).

Cohen had been Trump’s personal attorney and “fixer” for more than a decade before he was caught up in Trump-related investigations, and ultimately convicted on felony charges and sentenced to three years in prison.
In the meantime, Cohen turned around and began cooperating with authorities and Congress. He recently completed several appearances before congressional committees before he has to report to prison.
“Two, while he was acting attorney general, Mr. Whitaker was directly involved in conversations about whether to fire one or more U.S. attorneys,” Nadler added.
“Three, while he was acting attorney general, Mr. Whitaker was involved in conversations about the scope of the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney [Geoffrey] Berman’s recusal, and whether the Southern District went too far in pursuing the campaign finance case in which the president was listed as Individual-1,” he added.

567,"Legislation Would Ban Discrimination Against Gay, Transgender Americans",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/legislation-would-ban-discrimination-against-gay-transgender-americans/,"Lawmakers from both sides of Congress–including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi–have introduced a bill which would add sexual orientation and gender identity to the Civil Rights Act, to protect those who are gay or transgender from a broad spectrum of discrimination.
The Equality Act initially was designed to simply protect gay and transgender Americans from discrimination in employment, Pelosi said.
“But everybody just said, ‘Why should we be ending discrimination in the workplace? What about in every place – in housing, in every place?’

“So, that’s when [Democratic Rep. David] Cicilline stepped forward and said, ‘We’ll open the Civil Rights Act.’ Not a small thing to do, and that’s why [Democratic Rep.] Lewis and the Congressional Black Caucus and all of our members were so important in getting behind that fully so here we are today.”
Cicilline, of Rhode Island, is an openly gay member of Congress. Lewis, of Georgia, is known as a leader and hero of the original civil rights movement.
Although Congress has repealed the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” ban on gay and lesbian servicemembers and the Supreme Court recognized same-sex marriage, gay and transgender Americans continue to face discrimination on a variety of fronts, supporters of the Equality Act noted.
To remedy that, the Equality Act would add sexual orientation and gender identity as categories to the Civil Rights Act.
The Equality Act would ensure that LGBTQ Americans are protected by the same federal non-discrimination laws that already apply to race, religion, and more.

Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Susan Collins (R-Me.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced the legislation, joined by 43 of their Senate colleagues.
The legislation was filed simultaneously in the House by Cicilline, joined by 239 representatives.
“All Americans deserve a fair opportunity to pursue the American dream,” said Sen. Collins. “Throughout my Senate service, I have worked to end discrimination against LGBTQ Americans, from leading the repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ to advocating for the passage of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  It is time we ensure that all people are judged on their talents and abilities, and have full access to the services they need and the opportunities they seek. 
“This bill marks the beginning of that process, and I urge my colleagues to join me as we take steps to build bipartisan consensus around the Equality Act,” Collins added.

568,Disney Heiress: ‘We Do Not Have a Society Structured Around Fairness’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/disney-heiress-we-do-not-have-a-society-structured-around-fairness/,"Although Republicans are often trying to tag any and all Democrats as socialists, a member of one of the nation’s oldest and wealthiest entertainment families believes that the wealthy should be taxed more in order to create a fairer and more just society.
“We are creating a two-tiered society which we should fear,” Abigail Disney said during a recent segment of CNBC.
When it’s suggested to Disney that wealthy Americans would leave the nation to avoid higher taxes, she shot back that then they should leave.

“You know, my feeling about this is the ones who leave because of tax rates going up here are welcome to leave. Frankly, we don’t want them here. Because what they don’t want to participate in is a society that is structured around fairness,” she said. “We do not have a society structured around fairness right now and the proof is in the pudding.
“Look at the lives of working class people in America. I talk to workers at Disneyland who can’t afford their insulin because they’re working at minimum wage,” she added. “This is unacceptable and I can’t sit back and accumulate wealth …”
Democrats have come under increasing political fire from Republicans as Democrats propose such sweeping programs as Medicare-for-all and a “Green New Deal” to address the kinds of issues Disney referred to.

569,Billionaire Impeachment Activist Steyer Hits Pelosi: Don’t Ask Republicans for Permission to Impeach Trump,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/billionaire-impeachment-activist-steyer-hits-pelosi-dont-ask-republicans-for-permission-to-impeach-trump/,"Wealthy progressive activist Tom Steyer is not satisfied with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s declaration that Donald Trump is “not worth” impeachment.
Steyer has been advocating, and building a case for, Trump’s impeachment and removal from office for some time.
Despite many House Democrats also supporting impeachment, Pelosi has long resisted pushing that option as it would be divisive and the Senate likely lacks Republican support to actually remove Trump from office.
The California Democrat seemed to close the door on impeachment with her comment that Trump isn’t “worth it.”
Steyer, who has pursued Trump’s impeachment with commercials, town hall meetings across the country, as well as TV appearances, wants Pelosi to pursue impeachment even if it’s politically difficult.

“What we have here is constitutional oversight task that is directly given to Congress to make sure to protect our system itself and to delegate that to the Justice Department and the criminal justice system after he has been president, means that in fact they decided not to uphold the Constitution, they decided to overlook the rule of law, and they decided to put the American people and our safety at risk,” Steyer said during a recent segment on MSNBC.
“In fact, when people say there is one way to get rid of him or another, actually you are making a decision,” Steyer added. “Nancy says in her statement in The Washington Post, we know he’s unfit for office. We know he has broken the law. All of those things we’ve decided in Washington, D.C. that in fact we are not going to do anything about it because it’s politically difficult. So unless Republicans give us permission to do something, we are going to sit on our hands and let him go unaccountable.”
Public hearings–such as the recent session held with former Trump fixer Michael Cohen before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee–will convince the American public that Trump needs to be removed, Steyer said.
Some 54 percent of those polled do not want Trump impeached, opposed to 42 percent who do, according to a Monmouth poll released earlier this month.
“Well, I believe that this president is the biggest crisis for America in a generation,” Steyer said. “And I believe that when people get a chance through hearings like the hearing with Mr. Cohen in front of the House Oversight Committee, Americans will be glued to their TV sets that they will in fact see with their own eyes directly how lawless this president is, and they will insist that he be removed from office. But they have to have public hearings to be able to see it on TV and make up their own minds.”

570,Bipartisan Senators Propose Bill To Stop Big Tech Companies’ ‘Spying on Children’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/bipartisan-senators-propose-bill-to-stop-big-tech-companies-spying-on-children/,"Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) introduced legislation aimed at stopping corporate giants, including social media titans, from targeting and tracking kids online.
Among its many provisions, the bipartisan bill would update the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by prohibiting Internet companies from collecting personal and location information from anyone under the age of 13 without parental consent and from anyone ages 13 to 15 without the user’s consent, according to the authors of the legislation.
“Big tech companies know too much about our kids, and even as parents, we know too little about what they are doing with our kids’ personal data. It’s time to hold them accountable,” said Hawley, a freshman member. “Congress needs to get serious about keeping our children’s information safe, and it begins with safeguarding their digital footprint online.”
The legislation also would create an “eraser button” so parents and kids can delete personal information, and a “Digital Marketing Bill of Rights for Minors” that limits the collection of personal information, its authors say.

The bill additionally would establish a first of its kind Youth Privacy and Marketing Division at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which will be responsible for addressing the privacy of children and minors and marketing directed at children and minors.
Text of the bill can be found HERE.
“The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act remains the constitution for kids’ privacy online, but today we introduce an accompanying bill of rights,” said Markey, original House author of COPPA. “In 2019, children and adolescents’ every move is monitored online, and even the youngest are bombarded with advertising when they go online to do their homework, talk to friends, and play games. In the 21st century, we need to pass bipartisan and bicameral COPPA 2.0 legislation that puts children’s well-being at the top of Congress’s priority list. If we can agree on anything, it should be that children deserve strong and effective protections online.”

571,Delaware Senator Confident Biden Will Run In 2020,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/delaware-senator-confident-biden-will-run-in-2020/,"A senator from Joe Biden’s home state of Delaware is certain that the former vice president will make a run for the White House himself.
There has been much speculation whether Biden will join the race, which has already attracted a dozen or so Democrats all vying for the Democratic nomination.
“He is moving closer, he’s someone who I am confident is going to run, I’m optimistic he’s going to run, everything is being put in place but that last decision, which you know understandably is a big decision,” Democratic Sen. Chris Coons said during a segment of CBS News.
Should Biden run, he will do so on “a simple and positive message,” Coons said.

“Think about it. From my perspective the worst thing about President Trump is that he sees divisions in our country and he cracks them open. He exploits them for his own personal and partisan advantage,” Coons added. “Joe Biden is someone who sees the differences in our country and inspires us. Reminds us of the ways in which we’ve overcome them in the past and will lift us up.
“I personally have witnessed him comforting and encouraging Americans who suffered great loss,” Coons added. “He knows how to get back up when knocked down, and he’s going to restore our place in the world, respect for the presidency, and leadership by the president.”
With his decades in the Senate and eight years as vice president, Biden would be a great contrast to Trump who entered office with no prior military or elected experience, said Coons.
“Having President Trump, someone who never served either in the military or in elected office, as our president has had real and negative consequences,” Coons said. “I was at the Munich Security conference a few weeks ago, it was obvious how much of a command of the world’s stage Joe Biden would have as president from day one.”
Although the field of competitors for the nomination already is large, Biden would enter as the immediate front-runner, at least according to recent polling.
Further, polling already puts Biden competitive to actually beating Trump on Election Day in 2020.
This would be Biden’s third run for the White House. He ran in 1988 and again in 2008, each time falling short of the nomination. Of course, in 2008, nominee Barack Obama chose Biden as his running mate.

572,Schiff Backs Pelosi’s Comments on Impeachment,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/schiff-backs-pelosis-comments-on-impeachment/,"The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is backing up comments made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in which Pelosi appeared to shut the door on any attempt to impeach Donald Trump.
“In the absence of very graphic evidence, it would be difficult to get the support in the Senate needed to make an impeachment successful. Again, my feeling is let’s see what Bob Mueller produces,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), head of the House Intelligence Committee, referring to the investigation run by special counsel Robert Mueller, which is looking into any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. “The evidence would have to be pretty overwhelming.”

Although the Democratic-controlled House could potentially successfully impeach Trump, to remove him from office would require a supermajority of two-thirds of the Senate. That would require on the order of 20 Republican senators voting for removal, even if all Democratic senators held together and did so. Such vote counting is most likely not realistic in the current political environment.
It was reported this week that Pelosi told The Washington Post Magazine, when asked about Trump’s potential impeachment: “I’m not for impeachment. This is news, I’m going to give you some news right now because I haven’t said this to any press person before, but since you asked and I have been thinking about this, impeachment is so divisive to the country, that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he’s just not worth it.”
It remains to be seen whether Pelosi suffers any blowback from other House Democrats, as there are some–particularly newer members–who have remained committed to the idea of impeaching Trump.

573,"Democrats Rip Trump Budget, Potentially Setting Up Next Big Battle",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/democrats-rip-trump-budget-potentially-setting-up-next-big-battle/,"Top congressional Democrats slammed Donald Trump’s proposed budget for the next federal fiscal year.
Trump’s spending plan would make deep cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, federal student loan programs and the program known as SNAP, otherwise known as food stamps.
On the other hand, it calls for big increases in defense, as well as another $8.6 million for his wall on the southern border, on top of the $7 million Trump already claimed for his wall as part of his declaration of a “state of emergency.”
Trump’s budget proposal also includes $750 million to establish a paid parental leave program and $1 billion for a one-time fund to help underserved populations and encourage company investment in child-care.
It also includes $291 to support the initiative Trump announced in February at his State of the Union to work toward the end of HIV infection.
Democrats were appalled by steep cuts Trump wants to make in many key domestic programs.

“The cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump’s budget request are a roadmap to a sicker, weaker America,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “House Democrats will reject this toxic, destructive budget request which would hollow out our national strength and fail to meet the needs of the American people.
“Instead of building a stronger, healthier nation, President Trump’s budget would take away Americans’ health care and devastate the pillars of economic security for seniors and families.  After adding $2 trillion to the deficit with the GOP tax scam for the rich, President Trump wants to ransack as much as $2 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid,” she added. “While demanding billions more for his wasteful, ineffective wall, President Trump will steal from students and hungry families, from rural communities and American farmers, from clean air and clean water, and from vital, job-creating investments nationwide.
“The budget is a statement of values, and once again President Trump has shown how little he values the health and well-being of families across America. Democrats believe that hard-working families deserve a federal budget that is written For The People, not for the special interests and the wealthiest 1 percent,” Pelosi concluded.
Presidential budget proposals rarely make it into law as is, as Congress usually puts its stamp on federal spending. That has been historically the case, regardless of who the president has been. And it’s been the case thus far through the Trump presidency.
However, with his demand for funds for the border wall he wants, Trump has shown–with the longest federal shutdown on record and then his unilateral declaration of a “state of emergency”–that he is willing to go beyond what past presidents might have felt appropriate in order to achieve his budget and spending priorities.
This potentially sets up another contentious showdown heading toward October, as federal agencies need new appropriations or face another shutdown.
Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) took the step Monday of releasing a joint statement just to address Trump’s new request for more money for his wall.

“President Trump hurt millions of Americans and caused widespread chaos when he recklessly shut down the government to try to get his expensive and ineffective wall, which he promised would be paid for by Mexico,” the joint statement said. “Congress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government.  The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again.  We hope he learned his lesson.
“At a time when our country faces challenges about jobs for the future, this money would better be spent on rebuilding America, and on education and workforce development for jobs for the 21st Century,” the joint statement concluded.

574,Small Town Mayor Offers Big Political Reforms,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/small-town-mayor-offers-big-political-reforms/,"You probably don’t know much about Pete Buttigieg, starting with how to pronounce his last name.
He’s a former Navy lieutenant who served in Afghanistan. He’s a two-term mayor of South Bend, Ind., who also happens to be gay and, just last year, married his husband Chasten.
Now he’s running for president. Coming from a red state like Indiana, you might guess Buttigieg is casting himself as a very cautious, centrist candidate offering very cautious, centrist policies.
Except that you would be very wrong.
Yes, Buttigieg wants Democrats to talk to voters in very “common sense” terms, but from the Supreme Court, to the Electoral College and beyond, Buttigieg is suggesting some pretty strong reforms if he is elected next year.
For instance, with the Supreme Court having become such a bitterly political and partisan issue as it has tilted further to the right, Buttigieg has suggested that the court go from nine justices to 15.
“What we need to do is stop the Supreme Court from sliding toward being viewed as a nakedly political institution,” he said. “I’m for us contemplating whatever policy options will allow that to be possible. One of them involves having 15 instead of nine justices, but I’m not just talking about suppose I get elected as president and daring the next president who might be conservative to throw on a couple more. That’s the last thing we want to do. What we need to do is stop every vacancy from becoming this apocalyptic battle that harms the country.
“The proposal I mentioned that is one of many we should probably consider does expand the court to 15, but it changes the structure a little bit. Only 10 of them are politically appointed by Democratic or Republican presidents. The other five can only be seated by unanimous consent of the remaining 10,” Buttigieg explained. “So the idea is that those five by necessity will be those who command the respect of the other 10 and can be counted on to think for themselves.

“I don’t know that’s necessarily the right option, there’s others that have been floated that would involve a rotation of people up for the bench. … There’s some legal scholars who think this could be done just by statute, not with a change in the Constitution. So I think that it whichever particular mechanism is best, we need to begin to debate on what it will take to make sure our Supreme Court is less political,” Buttigieg added. “I don’t think there’s anything about this approach that’s anymore radical than the shattering of norms they have gone through to get the court to where it is today.”
He also has called for doing away with the Electoral College, which has now produced two presidential results in the past 20 years in which the winner of the popular vote did not end up becoming the president.
“At risk of sounding simplistic, one thing I believe is in a presidential election, the person who gets the most votes ought to be the person that wins. I can see Twitter mentions blowing up now. If we’re not a democratic society, what are we? If we can’t come together on an equal vote, how can we say’re a democratic society? We ought to make sure that everybody has the same voice,” Buttigieg said.
“… The general trajectory of America has been that it became more democratic over time. We extended the vote to more people. We made it possible for individuals to vote on their senators instead of state that changed in the grand scheme of things. And we stand now to be a generation that sees democracy in retreat,” he added. “Even the international rankings of how free and democratic different country are, we’re slipping in the rankings. It’s incredibly troubling because barriers are being put up for the ability to vote.”
Buttigieg also wants to change the way Americans think about and address climate change.
“We have to treat this like the emergency that it is and we’ve also got to treat it as a security issue because we need our expectations of 21st century security to include the concept of climate security,” he said. “… What are we going to do about it? It’s not like it’s going to be easy. To some extent, we’re already in adaptation mode no matter what, because of the warming that’s already occurred and will be unstoppable. But we’ve got to make sure that we are reducing carbon levels at least to the kinds of commitments that were in the Paris Accord, which we should rejoin immediately when the new president takes office.
“More investments in renewables are going to be needed. We are going to have to contemplate a carbon tax. And by the way, there are ways to do it that most Americans would be better off fiscally because we could return it right back to the American people,” Buttigieg added. “But in so doing would help capture the true cost of things that are happening right now because it’s in your and my lifetime that cost is going to be paid one way or the other.”

575,Democrats Use Weekly Address To Put Pressure For HR 1 Senate Vote,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/democrats-use-weekly-address-to-put-pressure-for-hr-1-senate-vote/,"A freshman House member delivered the Democrats’ weekly address to the nation, to pressure the Republican Senate to consider the major political-reform package just approved by the House.
Rep. Andy Kim, of New Jersey, delivered remarks touting the importance of the bill known as H.R. 1, the For The People Act, which passed the House March 8 on a vote of 234-193.
The legislation, which would provide federal ethics reform, make it easier for Americans to vote, and reduce the influence of dark money in government, has been a top priority for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Although it passed the House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) is opposed to the bill and has said he will not bring it to a vote on the Senate floor.
Kim’s address apparently is aimed at putting grassroots pressure on Senate Republicans to push McConnell to change course.

“H.R. 1 reminds us that our democracy doesn’t just exist here in Washington. It exists with each and every one of us,” Kim said. “H.R 1 reminds us that our democracy can never be taken for granted, that working together we can guide it and create a more perfect representative union. … The time is now to act. I call on the Senate to take up this bill and deliver what the American people deserve.”

576,Warren’s Plan To Break Up Tech Giants Picks Up Unexpected Endorsement,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/warrens-plan-to-break-up-tech-giants-picks-up-unexpected-endorsement/,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s proposal to split up many technology industry giants found support from an unexpected source: a conservative analyst at Fox News.
The senator from Massachusetts, who is among a dozen or so Democrats competing for the Democratic nomination for president, has said huge online companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google are operating as monopolies and need to be broken up so that other companies once again can compete.
“So Amazon, Google, they own a platform which is pretty cool. Where everybody comes to buy and sell or to do the searches. And at the same time, they own a bunch of businesses that are competing with all those folks who are coming, say, to Amazon in order to sell their goods,” Warren said during a recent segment on MSNBC. “And they don’t just compete straight up. They compete by being able to keep all of the information from every one of those companies. And then decide, ‘Oh, I’m going after you and you and I know how much to charge and I know what kind of volume to expect.’
“It’s a little like being an umpire in baseball and owning a team. My view is you can do one, be an umpire, or the other, own a team. But you don’t get to do both at the same time,” she added.
Warren’s proposal is interesting, as she has long been involved in consumer protection. In the past, however, it’s largely been in the area of banks and financial services. It was Warren who played a pivotal role in creating the new federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Warren’s tech antitrust plan came up for debate during a recent segment of Fox News, where it found an unexpected defender in Pete Hegseth, conservative commentator.
“I’m going to defend Elizabeth Warren. I’m serious,” Hegseth said. “… I actually agree with her argument. I don’t think you are ending these tech companies breaking them up and become anticompetitive crowding out the little guy. She is saying at some point in America the government does have a role to make sure that small business has an opportunity to compete. It’s actually a very compelling argument.”

577,The Stupidity of Politics,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-stupidity-of-politics/,"Politics plays an ever-increasing role in everyone’s life — and is usually the most common topic that is reported by news publishers. However, many parts of politics still remain outdated and, in some ways, stupid.
The Competition
Political parties once were just two groups of people with different beliefs and wanted nothing to do with each other. However, it has grown to parties that are bent on discrediting every other party, and believing that only they are right. What once were people with similar beliefs banding together has become a monstrosity bent on destroying the other party and acquiring new members.
Let take, for example, California. California is widely accepted as the most Democratic state in the United States. California just so happens to be the most populous state with the most representative in the House. Losing votes would be very damaging to the Democrats, so they have to constantly acquire new members and educate the children of California on why Democrats are good and Republicans are so bad.
One example of this would be in history textbooks. As you can see from the images below (Source: Twitter), a history textbook is clearly written to portray Trump as a bad person. Everyone has biases, but in history? Really?
See, now, instead of people making their own decisions and joining the party that they feel their decisions are aligned with, its parties making decisions for the people.
Maybe one day, the parties could learn to cooperate and actually work something out. Not just oppose each other.
But of course, politics is all about gaining more power. And with power, comes corruption, war, and malice.
Besides that, many parties also end up “voting” for people. Obviously, they don’t physically do it, but most people are too lazy to thoroughly search an issue, and, therefore, just vote based on what everyone else in their party thinks.

Take, for example, a friend of mine. Recently, I asked him about his opinions on the 2020 candidates. He told me that he didn’t care. When I asked him who he was voting for, he told me “whoever the Democrat is.”
These people are supposed to improve our government?
– Steven Joe, Independent Voter

The Electoral College
Perhaps the most stupid thing I have seen in politics, whether you are left
or right-wing or fall anywhere in between, is that we still use them Electoral College system in favor of the popular vote.
This is largely because when polled, people will generally respond negatively to change in the Constitution, but this is based on the phrasing of the question. The same folks responding no to a change would likely want the American populous to decide who becomes POTUS. It seems like an antiquated way of determining who the next leader of our country.
– Beverly Friedmann, ReviewingThis, Content Manager

Lies, Lies, Lies
It is the lying and misrepresentation of nearly every single fact or piece of information that is delivered to the public.
It doesn’t matter what your party affiliation is, they all lie. If you delve into politics and listen to both sides, you can tell when Nancy Pelosi or Mitch McConnell are either grandstanding and pandering to their constituents and the diehards in the party or just want to change the narrative.
Literally, no one will admit to the public that one or the other has done anything good for the country.it was true with Obama and it is true with Trump. Whatever happened to honest dialogue in politics?
– Robert Sollars

578,"Obama: Climate Change Creating ‘More Toxic’ Politics, ‘Scale of Tragedy We’ll See’ Is Unprecedented in History",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/environment/obama-climate-change-creating-more-toxic-politics-scale-of-tragedy-well-see-is-unprecedented-in-history/,"Former President Barack Obama mocked Republicans who question the global warming theory during a recent appearance in Calgary, Canada.
The changing climate, Obama told a large crowd at the Saddledome, is creating a “more toxic politics.”
“Within your children’s lifetime we can have a really chaotic situation that is hard to reverse,” Obama said, “Imagine when you have not a few hundred thousand migrants who are escaping poverty or violence or disease, but you now have millions. Imagine if you start seeing monsoon patterns in the Indian subcontinent changing so that half a billion people can’t grow food and are displaced.”
Obama also warned that global warming will create a “scale of tragedy” unknown in the history of mankind. 

“At the current pace that we are on, the scale of tragedy that will consume humanity is something we have not seen in perhaps recorded history if we don’t do something about it.”
Acknowledging that many in the Alberta crowd are affiliated with the oil and gas industries, Obama said they would need to “make some choices” before it’s “too late.”
“If you are a practical person and you let’s say work in the oil and gas in history right now and it provides a great living and you feel like you’re providing a great service and this is critical to a global economy and you take great pride in your work you should, but understand that we’re going to have to make some choices one way or the other, and either we’re going to do it intentionally and thoughtfully, and — and and seriously or it will happen to us,” he said. “And by the time it happens to us it may be too late.” 
Speaking of Republicans, the former president said he gets frustrated at their skepticism of manmade climate change. 
“What I do get frustrated with is, and this is more extreme for the United States where I’ve got a you know a U.S. senator who is actually the chairman of the Energy Committee, holding up a snowball in Washington on the floor of the Senate and saying, ‘Look there’s no global warming because it’s cold outside,’” Obama said, eliciting laughs from the crowd.”
“You laugh. This happened,” he said. “That’s not a good way of approaching problems.”
Obama said combating climate change will mean making personal sacrifices.
“All of us are going to have to recognize that there are trade-offs involved with how we live, how our economy is structured and the world that we’re going to be passing on to our kids and grandkids,” he said. “Nobody is exempt from that conversation.”

579,"Democrats Better Moderate Their Policies – or Risk Losing to Trump, again",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/democrats-better-moderate-their-policies-or-risk-losing-to-trump-again/,"If the Democrats want to defeat Donald Trump at the polls in 2020 (assuming he even runs again), they’d better radically alter their proposed policies before it’s too late.
And this is coming from a confirmed Democrat who would like nothing more than to see the Trumpster go back to shady real estate deals–or embrace a leisurely retirement at Mar-a- Lago.
Three major Democratic initiatives are seriously flawed–the Green New Deal, Medicare for All and Taxing the Rich (at the previously unrealistic and unfair rates).
Let’s start with the Green New Deal (a fossil fuel free economy by the year 2029).  I have solar power in my house, an electric vehicle (EV) in the driveway, and collect rainwater to combat drought (which I give seminars about within my community in liberal California). My essay on Medium.com details the last 10-year climate initiative that failed. See https://theascent.pub/global-warming-and-global-warnings-the-ipcc-lester-r-brown-and-me-cc7a1bb5c7d6

I’m about as green as green can be short of living as a cave man, and not naive about what it would take to combat global climate change in America by such a date.  And, besides, if policies are implemented to discourage new and much more efficient nuclear plants, and minimally polluting natural gas generation, then they’re wildly misdirected.
Oil burned as gasoline is everyone’s bogeyman as far as transporation related carbon dioxide pollution is concerned, but with less than 2 percent of us driving and owning EVs, fuel-cell or biodiesel powered cars, the future of oil is, well, rather secure. Especially in all our plastics and chemical concoctions.
Now, onto Medicare for All. A single-payer, universal plan that works (basically) in Canada, Britain and elsewhere is desirable–except that America can’t afford it at present with its $22 trillion dollars national debt (according to the Wall Street Journal).  And bumping everyone off of their private insurance plans–with a promise of “you can keep your doctor” is one of those false incentives, and ingenuous slogans, that led to cracks in the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare). 
Covering everyone for pre-existing conditions, regulating cost overruns and eliminating the millions (billions?) of dollars in Medicare fraud would go a long way toward stabilizing our health care system. (Maybe making Medicare available at the Social Security age of 62 would be a start, as its 80-percent coverage is much better than nothing at all–or high premiums for full coverage when you’re relatively young and don’t need repetitive or chronic medical attention.)
Someday maybe we can afford to do what Canada does–even though, in reality, there are some provinces, such as British Columbia, that have some surcharges in addition to basic coverage. As well as long waits for elective care that drive some Canadian crazy, for who can afford to come south–and not just for the winter warmth…
Re-establishing sky-high tax rates for the uber rich (except that defining “rich” is a slippery slope) is certainly one way to kill a prosperous economy, as previous democratic presidencies have learned.  I don’t understand why Democrats fail to see the chilling effects of high taxes on business expansion–especially since the majority of businesses are small, and often run by Democrats. 

I, a Woodstock festival veteran, have been in business in a variety of ways most of my adult life–and working for others, while a reality for most, should not discourage entrepreneuralism (I coined the term “entrpreneuring” in my book on surviving the last recession). Liberals shouldn’t be opposed to hard work and the fruits of private enterprise–and pure socialism removes most incentives.
At this point I don’t see any Democratic candidates I can, in good conscience, support. Most lack charisma and many are short on basic common sense. Where are the John Kennedys and Franklin Roosevelts, who scholars consider among the 10 best Democratic presidents of all time?  (Donald Trump, according to one bipartisan scholarly panel, is scraping the bottom of the presidential barrel–at least he was closing in on the two-year tenure mark.) 
To some extent learning on the job is necessary, but not from a standing start.  (Had he been more receptive to listening to advisors instead of firing many of them I might be more respectful.)
Our country clearly needs a leader who is truly multidisciplinary, well educated (and read), mature and also wise in the ways of politics and statesmanship.  (Guess who doesn’t have those qualities.)
So unless something changes, I might not be voting at all in 2020 so at least I won’t have to feel guilty that I helped elect a political buffoon. And buffoons come in all ages and sizes, male and female, with nicely coiffed hairdos and freshly pressed suits. (Well, except for Bernie Sanders, who just threw his hat in the ring for a second go.)

580,Pelosi Slams Trump For Weak Feb. Jobs Report,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/pelosi-slams-trump-for-weak-feb-jobs-report/,"While Donald Trump is eager to take credit for any positive developments in the US economy, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi knocked Trump and his Republican allies for the anemic February jobs report released Friday.
The US economy added a paltry 20,000 jobs in February, according to federal data.
Among financial analysts, there was some debate whether the meager February jobs numbers should be seen as a worrying sign, or only as an anomaly in an essentially strong economy.
Pelosi, however, saw reason to criticize Trump’s economic stewardship.
“February’s abysmal jobs numbers are a stark warning from an economy being hollowed out by the GOP’s devastating special interest agenda,” Pelosi says.
“Years of Republican giveaways to big corporations and the wealthiest few have jeopardized the financial security of working families,” she added. “Jobs and household wealth are faltering. Despite the president’s promises, our nation faces a historic trade deficit. And the future of America’s middle class is burdened by a tax scam that has driven up record budget deficits in order to enrich Big Pharma, big banks, big corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent.

“As Republicans continue to push their failed policies, House Democrats are working For The People to lower health care costs and the price of prescription drugs, raise wages by rebuilding America with green, modern and job-creating infrastructure and restore integrity to Washington,” Pelosi adds.

581,"Rural, Red-state Dems Say: Don’t Forget About Us",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/election/rural-red-state-dems-say-dont-forget-about-us/,"Democrats have begun crafting a legislative agenda with control of the US House, while others are fanning out across the country seeking the nomination to run for president.
But Democrats from rural and red-state America are asking their national leaders to talk to voters in these regions with “common sense” solutions to the nation’s problems.
“I think any of the candidates can appeal to that radical middle. I think that what we need to be looking at is the same thing I kind of ran on in 2017, and that is the kitchen table issues,” says Sen. Doug Jones, the first Democrat to win a US Senate seat from Alabama in more than 20 years and who faces an uphill re-election fight next year. “It is about health care, and you can debate Medicare for all, you can debate tweaking the Affordable Care Act, you can talk about public options. But the debate, I mean, the discussion about health care is, I think, a driving issue for all Americans, and that’s where — I think that’s going to be a really big issue. I see a lot of that coming up.
“I think wages — we need to get wages up, whether that means increasing them in minimum wage, or just simply  working to make sure that people, and these manufacturers, and these businesses do that on their own,” Jones adds. “However it comes up, I think there’s a lot of ways that we can work.”

Whomever ultimately becomes the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee must be able to compete anywhere and everywhere, according to Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat whose state of Pennsylvania typically votes Democratic for president but narrowly went to Donald Trump in 2016.
“Well, the challenge is that the nominee of our party–and I think we’ll arrive at a nominee who can do this–has to be able to compete not only in urban areas and suburban communities but has to get some share of what I would call rural and small town Pennsylvania,” Casey says. “And you’ve got to be able to do both. I think our nominee will be able to do that.”
Pete Buttigieg–the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and himself a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president–says it’s not necessarily a matter of “centrist” policies, but how to talk about policies which are more progressive.
For instance, Buttigieg cites the example of the “Green New Deal,” the expansive progressive proposal to take on climate change. In that case, there has been talk of eliminating cattle due to the methane emissions from their flatulence.
Those kinds of ideas are “vulnerable to being caricatured” by political opponents, the way conservatives once used the concept of “death panels” against Barack Obama’s healthcare reform, Buttigieg says.
Democrats need make sure they are discussing and solving climate change in an inclusive manner, he says.
“I enjoy going down to get a cheeseburger in South Bend. I just want to not have the city flooded while I’m on my way there, right? And there’s a common sense way of talking about this that I think people, regardless of ideology, at least most people can get,” Buttigieg says.
“You know, it’s not written in stone that the middle of the country has to be conservative,” he adds. “I mean, much of the best American progressive tradition comes from the middle of the country. You got — it goes all the way to back to John Brown in Kansas, you think about William Jennings Bryan from the middle of the country, Eugene Debs, outright socialist from Indiana. So it’s not that a certain part of the country has to be right or has to be left.
“It’s that we have to explain these things in terms that remind everybody what’s at stake, and I would argue that in an agricultural area, so you know, my part of the country, we got a lot of corn and soy,” Buttigieg adds. “We have a whole lot at stake in these issues and we need to have the vocabulary and the argument be about that, not about farting cows.”

582,"‘Bad Ass’ Ocasio-Cortez Finds Her Fans, Including Geraldo Rivera",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/bad-ass-ocasio-cortez-finds-her-fans-including-geraldo-rivera/,"Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been a political lightning rod since the moment she was a 29-year-old bartender who defeated a long time Democratic incumbent in her 2018 primary.
The new congresswoman has been under both a degree of scrutiny and attack that seems a bit out of place for a lawmaker whose elected career still can be measured in weeks.
This is not to say the New York Democrat hasn’t been busy, co-sponsors a highly ambitious plan to tackle climate change known as the “Green New Deal.”
Aside from her politics, Republicans have carped on Ocasio-Cortez for everything from her clothing, to a video of her dancing in college as if that were to prove anything.
These efforts, however, to turn people against this pol now known as “AOC,” don’t seem to have been entirely effective.
She scored very high with participants in a Democratic focus group conducted by CNN.
Asked to comment on her, one participant called her a “bad ass,” while another remarked, “What a woman.”
The participant who described the congresswoman as a “bad ass” elaborated, “I mean, she’s asking the right questions. She — I don’t feel like she’s playing games. I’m so excited about her. She is smart, she is intelligent, and I cannot wait to see what else she does.”
A second participant commented, “She’s got the Democratic Party nervous in a way they should be nervous, because she does represent the new — the new guard, the new generation. I think she really kind of personifies where we expected things to go down the line.”
And yet a third participant referred to Ocasio-Cortez as “the candidate of the future.”
“She’s got this down pat and she has also nailed it,” this third participant said. “And as a woman in a male-dominated field. Women in male dominated fields, we have to work like this all the time.”
Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez also drew support elsewhere, from a much more surprising source over on Fox News, that being long-time TV host and Fox personality Geraldo Rivera.

“You know, I may be the only person in the country who supports both Donald Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,” Rivera said during a recent segment. “In her case, the reason I generally am supportive of her is that she has been a tremendous inspiration to young people. She has gotten this whiny millennial generation off the couches in their mothers’ basements and instilled in them the possibility that they maybe could even be more successful than their parents. I think it’s been a ‘woe is me’ kind of generation.”

583,"Trump Can Avoid Rebuke If He Rescinds ‘Emergency,’ Rand Paul Advises",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-can-avoid-rubuke-if-he-rescinds-emergency-rand-paul-advises/,"Donald Trump could avoid the congressional rebuke coming his way, if only he would rescind the “state of emergency” which he has declared, advises Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky.
Paul is one of at least four Republican senators who have publicly said that they will vote for the resolution of disapproval which will soon come to the Senate floor.
Trump last month declared a “state of emergency,” as a means to bypass Congress and essentially raid the military budget in order to build the border wall he has long wanted.
Democrats, and some Republicans, have objected to that move on constitutional grounds, as a violation of the principles of separation of powers and the power of the purse.
“In fact, the Constitution says only Congress can make law and only by law can you take money out of the Treasury and appropriation to an act of Congress,” Paul says.
The Democratic-controlled House responded by passing a resolution of disapproval. Because the resolution is privileged, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell must bring it to a vote.
“I think there will be probably 10 Republicans, at least six beyond the four that are going to vote for it, have told me they will,” Paul says. “It could be higher than that. What I keep telling them is if we can get to a high enough number maybe someone could run over to the White House and say, ‘Hey, this could be worse.’ This could be 65, this could be 67. I know that’s very optimistic. I might only be 57 to 60, but that’s still a lot of dissent and rebuke that could be avoided if the president would simply rescind the emergency part.”
Paul’s home-state colleague, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, admits that he had advised Trump not to go the route of declaring a “state of emergency,” and that the issue has been a source of debate within the Senate Republicans.

“I don’t personally think there is a constitutional issue. Some have raised questions about the authorization itself. I don’t have a solution to how this ultimately ends other than a prediction that at the end of the day, the president in all likelihood is going to get a measure that he will veto, and will almost certainly be sustained, the veto will be sustained in the House,” McConnell says.

584,Democrats Band Together To Restore Net Neutrality,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/democrats-band-together-to-restore-net-neutrality/,"A diverse group of Democratic lawmakers from the House and Senate came together Wednesday to introduce a bill which would restore the concept of “net neutrality” over the Internet.
Called the Save the Internet Act, the legislation would reverse the repeal by Trump administration’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in late 2017 of net neutrality protections which had been put in place by the Obama administration.
In general, the concept of net neutrality essentially means service providers should treat all Internet communication equally and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, or method of communication, according to its definition.
The adoption of net neutrality regulations the Obama years was seen as a big win for consumers.
Repealing net neutrality was part of the Trump administration’s overall highly deregulatory approach.

The new legislation would enact the three legacy net neutrality principles – no blocking, no throttling and no paid prioritization – and empowers the FCC to prohibit unjust, unreasonable and discriminatory practices, the bill’s supporters say. 
The legislation also would ensure consumers could make informed decisions when shopping for internet plans and restores the FCC’s authority to fund broadband access and deployment, particularly for rural communities and struggling Americans. 
The Save the Internet Act would codify the FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order in a similar manner to last year’s Congressional Review Act that passed the Senate and had bipartisan support in the House, bill sponsors say.
“The free and open Internet is a pillar of our democracy,” says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  “It is an honor to join Democrats from both sides of the Capitol to introduce this strong legislation, which honors the will of the millions of Americans speaking out to demand an end to the Trump assault on net neutrality.  Democrats are proudly taking bold action to restore net neutrality protections: lowering costs and increasing choice for consumers, giving entrepreneurs a level playing field on which to compete, helping bring broadband to every corner of the country, and ensuring that American innovation and entrepreneurialism can continue to be the envy of the world.”

585,Rep. Davids on HR-1: Kris Kobach ‘Notoriously’ Made It Harder for People to Vote,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/rep-davids-on-hr-1-kris-kobach-notoriously-made-it-harder-for-people-to-vote/,"The nation needs approval of the House Democrats’ signature political reform bill to prevent state officials–such as former secretary of state Kris Kobach in her home state–who work to prevent many citizens from casting ballots, says freshman Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.).
“So, you know, I think that HR-1 gets to the heart of what a lot of folks feel is a problem with our government and elected officials which is that we have a lack of trust between our government and the way it’s being operated and the people who depend on our government to make sure that we all have access to opportunity, and when we think about what is the core of that,” Davids says.
“A lot of it has to do with huge amounts of money that are in politics and we need to increase the transparency of that. But it also has to do very acutely and as somebody from Kansas, you know, Kris Kobach was our secretary of state and was notoriously made it hard for people who are eligible to vote. He made it so much harder for folks to get to the ballot box. …
“This bill, particularly the piece of H.R.-1 and the part that I’m putting up has a lot to do with making sure that there’s accountability and that every vote counts,” Davids adds. “So if you have someone who is blocking your ability to vote that can you go straight to the Department of Justice and, you know, you have some recourse there to make sure that you’re not being left out of the democratic process. It’s really the foundation of our democracy.”
The bill, designated H.R. 1, the For The People Act, is an overall political reform package, which is a high priority for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
The Democratic House is expected to approve the bill easily.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been opposed to the bill from the beginning, however.
“I certainly don’t plan to even bring it to the floor here in the Senate,” McConnell said from the Senate floor.
Asked why he wasn’t giving it a vote, he sniped, “Because I get to decide what we vote on.”

586,Hillary: I’m Not Running In 2020,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/election/hillary-im-not-running-in-2020/,"Putting an end to weeks of speculation and waiting, Democrat Hillary Clinton has announced that she will not make a third run for president in 2020.
“I’m not running but I’m going to keep working, and speaking, and standing up for what I believe,” says the former secretary of state, senator and first lady.
News reports weeks ago of Clinton’s thoughts of jumping in made it sound like it was all about ego and emotion and nothing that said that Clinton was actually thinking this out in any meaningful way.

Unlike Clinton’s 2016 run, she would have faced a much larger field of rivals for the nomination in 2020. And, unlike 2016 where she enjoyed nominal front-runner status, that certainly would not have been the case this time.
The news reports essentially made it out that Clinton contemplated a potential rematch against Donald Trump, that she sensed strength against him since she won the popular vote the last time and that Trump now is even more unpopular with the American people.
However, the 2020 field of Democratic hopefuls already consists of several female candidates, including several considered more progressive than Clinton.
Clinton also would likely have had difficulty battling in the primary season against former vice president Joe Biden, who is said to be seriously considering the race.
Clinton’s first run for the White House occurred in 2008 and resulted in Clinton losing the nomination to Barack Obama.

587,"John Roberts: Closet Liberal, or Supreme Court Savior?",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/law/john-roberts-closet-liberal-or-supreme-court-savior/,"What began as a few whispers over a perplexing decision or two have now become almost the panicked cries of conservatives in Washington, wondering just what John Roberts is up to.
Roberts, chief justice of the Supreme Court, had been a solid, reliable court conservative since President George W Bush appointed him nearly 15 years ago.
Certainly, Roberts role wasn’t even questioned once eager, salivating right-wingers grabbed what should have been easy conservative control of the high court with Donald Trump’s two-fer pair of nominations: Neil M. Gorsuch and, then, Brett Kavanaugh.
Except–once conservatives thought they had all their set-pieces in place to begin what they hoped will be a generation of far-right jurisprudence–a funny thing started to happen.
Roberts, that stalwart conservative, started voting with the court’s liberal wing.
When it began last fall, the change in Roberts’ voting pattern coincided with a very public spat between the chief justice and President Trump.

In one of his many intemperate tweets, Trump complained about a federal judge striking down Trump’s migrant asylum ban, and in doing so, he blamed an “Obama judge.”
This attack raised Roberts’ ire. Known as an institutionalist, Roberts apparently takes public faith in the integrity and guarantee that they will be impartial as more than lip-service.
Roberts released an extraordinary statement of his own.
“We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them,” Roberts said.
So some assumed that initially, Roberts’ votes with the left was simply to punctuate his message to Trump.
Now, it seems to be something more.
Operated by unelected, lifetime-term personnel, the Supreme Court only can maintain public legitimacy through public acceptance and respect.
“All of us need to be aware of that—every single one of us—and to realise how precious the court’s legitimacy is,” liberal-wing Justice Elena Kagan told long time high-court journalist Dahlia Lithwick.
Roberts doesn’t even like the court issuing split 5-4 vote rulings for the split message that they send the public.
And, unlike many of his colleagues, Roberts does pay considerable attention to media coverage and public perception of the high court.
Indeed, this recent run of votes with the liberals is not Roberts’ first dalliance with the court’s left wing.

Although he originally planned to side with conservatives who planned to strike down Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, Roberts ultimately changed his mind and voted with the liberal wing to uphold Obamacare, particularly its individual mandate which said all Americans must carry health insurance or face a fine.
Roberts reportedly did so because he was concerned it “would prove he had been deceitful during his confirmation hearings, when he explained a philosophy of judicial restraint.”
Supreme Court justices appointed by Republicans suddenly taking left turns after a time on the bench were the nightmares of conservatives for decades. Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and David Souter all are examples of Republican-nominated justices who would become among the best-known of the court’s liberals.
In fact, conservatives have taken pains over recent decades to tighten the Supreme Court nomination process specifically to avoid any more of those surprises.
Few think Roberts really is the next Blackmun or Stevens.
“I don’t think this means he’s changing his mind on the substance of big important issues on which he’s written opinions — voting rights, campaign finance, abortion, gay marriage, etc.,” said Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer at the libertarian Cato Institute. “But at the margin he’s trying to make fewer partisan splits.”
But Roberts may well have a larger motivation. And that motivation is the highly political taint on court nominations since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, up to–and including–the confirmation of Roberts’ newest colleague on the court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Roberts is surely aware of the hightened level of partisanship represented when Senate Republicans refused to even consider President Barack Obama’s choice of Merrick Garland to succeed Scalia on the court.
The Supreme Court is highly collegial, and once a justice is confirmed, they are fully accepted as one of the team.
That doesn’t mean Roberts has to like how a colleague gets there, however. That’s especially true for the naked, venomous partisanship Kavanaugh spewed before the Senate Judiciary Committee trying to salvage his nomination after becoming the target of credible sexual assault allegations.

Roberts problem isn’t so much even with the sexual assault allegations, but the naked conservative partisanship of his response, railing about “apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election,” “revenge on behalf of the Clintons,” and “millions of dollars and money from outside left-wing opposition groups.”
Those are not words spoken by a sober, impartial jurist.
“I can’t imagine John Roberts was happy about that opening statement,” says Jill Dash, vice president for strategic engagement at the American Constitution Society, a liberal legal advocacy group. “He has done quite a bit to try to lift up the institution as a fair and neutral place to bring claims.”
Roberts is 63 years old, and theoretically could continue to lead the Supreme Court for decades to come.
While no one expects Roberts to become the court’s fifth liberal, the irony could be that these years that conservatives expected would be full-tilt conservative jurisprudence could instead be used by Roberts as a go-slow period to rebuild public confidence in the court.
“It’s clear that 5-4 decisions will be perceived by many, many lawyers, many politicians and large numbers of the public at large as ideological decisions,” said Lawrence Solum, constitutional law professor at Georgetown Law. “So given Roberts‘ desire to preserve the legitimacy of the court, he could be highly motivated to avoid decisions like that in the next immediate period in the history of the court. Whether that’s one year, or two years or five years, who knows?”

588,Kasich: Republicans Questioning Other Republicans Become the ‘Skunk at the Republican Party’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/kasich-republicans-questioning-other-republicans-become-the-skunk-at-the-republican-party/,"Politics have reached a point where congressional Republicans no longer feel that they can ask difficult questions of other Republicans, even when related to legitimate oversight, according to former Ohio governor John Kasich.
“Everything is so partisan now that I think that if you’re a Republican sitting up there, you’re afraid to ask the question because then you become kind of a skunk at the Republican Party,” says Kasich, who ran for the Republican nomination for president four years ago and has been mentioned as a potential primary challenger to Donald Trump in 2020.
Republicans didn’t always have this attitude when it came to their role in congressional oversight, Kasich recalled, harkening back to his younger days when he was a member of Congress himself beginning in the early 1980s.
“It’s such a different time. When I was in the Congress and we did investigations in defense where we saw the Marines blown up in Lebanon, we had to have tough questions,” he said. “This is not, like, I’m a Republican therefore I can’t ask the administration tough questions. But this is where we’ve come.
“Some people there, probably really believe that [former Trump attorney Michael] Cohen has no credibility, that the Democrats should never have called that hearing, but at the same time if you’re on that committee, I think you want to acquit yourself by saying, ‘Let’s get to some of the facts here,’ but they didn’t do it. This is where we live today and it’s really amazing,” Kasich said.
Kasich added his reaction to Republicans willing to, he said, tolerate Trump’s behavior.
“What’s amazing to me is the resilience of Republicans and their ability to put their heads in the sand in regard to Donald Trump and his activities,” he said.
“I talk to these Republicans, [and they say] ‘Well, my 401(k)’s better,’ or, you know, ‘We’re richer and he’s been a good president,’ and all that and in the meantime, think about how much this country has been hurt, attacks on the basic institutions in this country, the FBI, the press,” Kasich added.
“I got to tell you … these are kind of nuances for a lot of people. We follow it all the time but a lot of people don’t follow this. And they’re like, ‘My life is okay, I’m working, I have money and it’s just people wanting to pick on him,’ and that’s where a lot of Republicans live.”
Kasich made his remarks during a recent segment on CNN.

589,"Liberal Activist Appears at CPAC, Says GOP Successfully Captured Criminal Justice Reform",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/liberal-activist-appears-at-cpac-says-gop-successfully-captured-criminal-justice-reform/,"A well-known progressive activist made an appearance at the recent CPAC conservative gathering outside Washington DC to heap actual praise on conservatives for their successful work in the area of criminal justice reform.
Donald Trump raised the profile of criminal justice reform with his surprise commutation of the life sentence of convicted Memphis, Tenn., drug trafficker Alice Johnson. Johnson had for some time been seeking leniency when her case was brought to Trump’s attention by celebrity Kim Kardashian and Trump son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner.
Trump and congressional Republicans followed that up with the passage of a prison reform law known as the FIRST STEP Act, aimed at reducing recidivism among other objectives.

“My problem is I now have a conservative movement that–for libertarian reasons, for Christian conservative reasons, and for fiscally conservative reasons–is actually doing a great job on what should be my issue,” said activist and CNN host Van Jones. “This is supposed to be my issue. You are stealing my issue. Take some dadgum credit for being smart. Take some dadgum credit for getting it right.”

590,Markey On The ‘Green New Deal’: ‘We Should Not Be on the Defensive’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/markey-on-the-green-new-deal-we-should-not-be-on-the-defensive/,"A political football since nearly the day he and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) introduced it, Sen. Ed Markey is done watching the “Green New Deal” get constantly slammed by Republicans–and even a few Democrats.
Markey, who chaired a select committee on climate change the last time Democrats controlled the House, recently offered a lengthy discussion of just what the “Green New Deal” is, and what it is not in an interview for an online Yale University publication.
Markey, and those he counts as supporters, likely have just weeks before Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell schedules what amounts to a stunt vote on the resolution, with an to embarrassing Democrats who may vote on aspects of the “Green New Deal” which may not yet be well-understood or well-regarded by many average American voters.
For instance, the idea of pairing the greenhouse gas-reducing aspects of the resolution with it’s economic development ones comes straight from President Franklin Roosevelt, according to Markey.
“Well, the language in the resolution is essentially Franklin Roosevelt’s 1944 Second Bill of Rights [on economic security],” he says. “And what we did was to say that if we are going to engage in an overhaul of the way we generate electricity in our society, that we need massive job creation and that that transformation should be jobs but also justice. So that those communities that have been historically most harmed by pollution, and will be most harmed by climate impacts, are included in the Green New Deal. And that’s the right to a job, to health care, to education, because together those rights spell security. And that we should link these goals.
“But we don’t talk about single-payer health care. We don’t talk about any specific approach, other than the larger goals that FDR, and Harry Truman, Jack Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama have always used as the template for what the goals are for our country,” Markey adds. “We have a moral responsibility to lift up all workers and all communities.”
But one potential misunderstanding is that the Green New Deal is not one large piece of legislation, but rather a resolution meant to spur related legislation across Congress, Markey explains.

“Yes, that’s what we’re saying — that in each area now, we are calling on members of the House and Senate to introduce their bill,” he says. “So for example, there is a tax-extender bill, which will potentially be up for debate this year that will include extenders for wind tax breaks, solar tax breaks, electric vehicle tax breaks, tax breaks for storage technologies. And that’s the forum to have that debate.
“Each committee in the House and Senate, each member now has an ability to introduce legislation that can deal with the issue,” Markey adds. “So we’re having hearings. And what people forget is that Citizens United was decided [by the U.S. Supreme Court] in January of 2010. And that’s what led to a flood of money coming into the system in 2010, and that dropped the overall public acceptance that climate change is real by 20 points. So we’re now back up to 72, 73 percent [who accept the reality of climate change]. And we have a Green New Deal movement that’s been born.”
The Green New Deal has great potential to help American workers who need good-paying jobs, and ultimately a winning issue at the ballot box, Markey says.
“We should not be on the defensive,” he says. “We can create millions of blue collar jobs. The 350,000 people in wind and solar are roofers, they’re electricians, they’re sheet metal workers. There are 50,000 coal miners, and we now have 350,000 in wind and solar, and we’re going to knock on the door of 400,000 or 450,000 by the year 2020, and with millions more to come. So we shouldn’t be back on our heels. We should be leaning into this fight. We can explain that we are creating the greatest blue collar job-creation engine in decades. And I think it’s why we have touched a nerve with the American people. They are fed up with the Congress doing nothing to address this crisis, this existential threat. And if we frame it correctly with a positive agenda, I think it can in fact make a big positive difference in the 2020 election cycle.”

591,"Legislation Would Reunite, Protect Separated Migrant Children",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/immigration/legislation-would-reunite-protect-separated-migrant-children/,"A group of Democratic senators reintroduced the Reunite Every Unaccompanied Newborn Infant, Toddler and Other Children Expeditiously (REUNITE) Act, a bill to establish a permanent system of coordination between agencies and non-governmental organizations to expedite the reunification of separated immigrant families and promote humane alternatives for asylum-seeking immigrant families.
Based on numerous recent Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services Inspector General (IG) reports and internal documents and court filings, it has become clear that the Trump administration’s family separation crisis was far more calculated and extensive than previously reported and that government systems to reunify separated families remain entirely inadequate.
The administration has failed to fully comply with federal court orders to reunite families separated under the “zero tolerance” policy.
Alarmingly, the HHS IG revealed earlier this year that the administration previously separated additional thousands of children and parents or guardians with no system in place to track and reunify these families. The IG recommended “continued efforts to improve communication, transparency, and accountability for the identification, care, and placement of separated children.”
Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) are the senators behind the REUNITE Act.

“Last year, Americans were shocked to see pictures of children in cages and to hear toddlers crying out for their parents. The administration has failed to live up to their commitment to reunite families separated at the border,” says Harris. “The REUNITE Act would ensure that our government agencies have the resources they need to expedite the process of family reunification. We must do better for these children and families.”
The REUNITE Act would:
Require the DHS and HHS secretaries to publish guidance describing how they will reunify families. This guidance must include how to ensure sustained, no-cost contact between parents and children, access to children by legal counsel and other advocates, and unannounced inspections by child welfare organizations.
Require immediate reunification of children who remain separated from a parent and legal guardian with exceptions for child welfare.
Create presumption of release on recognizance, parole, or bond for parents of separated children.
Restore the Family Case Management Program.
Create presumption that parents will not be deported until their child’s immigration proceeding is over or the child turns 18.
Prohibit DHS from using information, including DNA information, obtained pursuant to this Act for immigration enforcement purposes.
Creates privacy protections around the use of DNA testing to establish familial relationships.
Requires the US attorney general, the DHS secretary, and the HHS secretary to establish the Office for Locating and Reuniting Children with Parents, an interagency office, to expedite and facilitate the reunification of children and parents separated after enter the United States.
Redirect $50 million in appropriations from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for the enforcement of this Act.
“Trump’s policy to deliberately inflict trauma on the children of families fleeing persecution is a dark and evil deed that continues to this day,” says Merkley. “As a nation, we should live up to our ideals by treating families fleeing persecution with respect and decency as they await a hearing on their asylum claims. That means doing everything in our power to reunite children with their families.”
In addition to Harris, Merkley and Cortez Masto, the bill is cosponsored by Sens. Richard Blumental (D-Conn.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), and Tom Carper (D-Del.).
“Children continue to be separated from their mothers and fathers at our southern border eight months after President Trump announced an end to his inhumane family separation policy,” says Cortez Masto. “The lack of transparency and blatant lies from this Administration continue to demonstrate that this President and his Secretary of Homeland Security cannot be trusted to bring these families back together. That’s why I’ve partnered with Senators Harris and Merkley to hold this President accountable by introducing legislation requiring the immediate reunification of children with their parents.”

592,Jay Inslee Jumps Into 2020 Fray as Climate Change Candidate,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/environment/jay-inslee-jumps-into-2020-fray-as-climate-change-candidate/,"Jay Inslee, the two-term governor of Washington State, has thrown his hat into the increasingly crowded field of hopefuls vying for the Democratic nomination for president.
Unlike most of his competitors, however, Inslee is staking his presidential campaign on a single issue: climate change.
It is certainly an area where Inslee can draw a bright line with incumbent Donald Trump.
Trump has denied the importance of climate change, at one point calling it a “Chinese hoax.”
He also has begun taking the steps to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accords, which are aimed at reducing the greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change.
Although, according to scientific consensus, climate change clearly is a significant issue for the United States to face, the question is whether voters will respond to a candidate, like Inslee, who makes it a campaign centerpiece.

“The science on this is abundantly clear. We have a very short period of time to act,” Inslee says. “Whether we shrink from this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time. And we know it is the 11th hour, but as we have shown time and time again throughout our nation’s history, this is our nation’s hour to shine. And I believe we will because of the urgency of the moment, the scope of the challenge. Because the economic growth opportunities inherent in clean energy are clear. And because no other issue touches so much of what we as a nation care most deeply about. And I am confident that we can do it.
“Climate change is no longer just a chart or a graph. It is right now, not in some distant future,” he adds.
Inslee is no stranger to living and dying, politically, on a single issue. In the 1990s, he was a freshman member of Congress. He voted for the Clinton-era assault weapons ban, knowing that it would likely cost him his seat.
It did. He regrouped in another area of Washington State and relaunched his political career.

593,"‘It Is My Duty and Responsibility’ To Seek Trump Impeachment, Rep. Tlaib Says",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/law/it-is-my-duty-and-responsibility-to-seek-trump-impeachment-rep-tlaib-says/,"A freshman Democrat says that it is her “duty and responsibility” to seek President Trump’s impeachment over violations of the US Constitution’s emoluments clause.
Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) made her most recent statements during a television interview, a much more sedate setting than a few weeks ago when she called for Trump’s impeachment using a crude epithet.
“For me as an attorney, somebody that just took the oath of office and upholding the United States Constitution, it is my duty and responsibility to hold every single person to the rule of law,” Tlaib said. “… And I can tell you, the biggest fear and what makes many of us upset is the fact [Trump] hasn’t divested in any of his domestic or international businesses. Much of the decisions he’s making right now is so much in conflict in what is the best interest of the American people. And this is the emolument clause of the United States it’s in there and very clear because this is not going to be our last CEO, folks.”
The emoluments clause of the Constitution is there to prevent any federal officer–including the president–from accepting gifts or money from any foreign sources. Trump certainly is receiving funds from foreign sources through his Washington DC hotel, located blocks from the White House.
“I mean, America needs to wake up and understand that if we’re going to let this president not provide and be transparent about not only his taxes but the fact he hasn’t completely cut ties with the Trump Organization,” Tlaib said, referring to the name of Trump’s private business.
“We’ve already seen leases entered into between the White House and the Trump Organization. We’ve seen over a thousand illegal contacts from Saudi Arabian governments and a number of other entities with the Trump Organization,” the Democrat says. “That alone is so dangerous and threatens our democracy in this country.”

Tlaib made her remarks during a segment on MSNBC.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other senior congressional Democrats have been more circumspect about the prospect of impeaching Trump.
They are afraid Trump could turn impeachment to his political benefit, much in the way President Bill Clinton accomplished after his impeachment for the Monica Lewinsky affair.

594,House Judiciary Launches Big New Trump Investigation,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/law/house-judiciary-launches-big-new-trump-investigation/,"The world of investigations into Donald Trump, his administration, campaign, and business efforts just got much larger Monday, with the launch of a major new probe by the House Judiciary Committee.
The House judiciary panel intends to look into alleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other abuses of power by Trump, his associates, and members of his administration. 
As a first step, the committee has served document requests to 81 agencies, entities, and individuals believed to have information relevant to the investigation. Some of those 81 are quite well-known, while others are much more obscure.
The committee’s investigation will cover three main areas:
Obstruction of justice, including the possibility of interference by the president and others in a number of criminal investigations and other official proceedings, as well as the alleged cover-up of violations of the law;
Public corruption, including potential violations of the emoluments clauses of the U.S. Constitution, conspiracy to violate federal campaign and financial reporting laws, and other criminal misuses of official positions for personal gain; and
Abuses of power, including attacks on the press, the judiciary, and law enforcement agencies; misuse of the pardon power and other presidential authorities; and attempts to misuse the power of the Office of the President.

For two years, in the absence of active oversight by the previous Republican House majority, House Judiciary Committee Democrats wrote more than 100 letters to the White House, the administration, and previous House Republican leadership documenting the failings of the Trump administration and demanding accountability.
“Over the last several years, President Trump has evaded accountability for his near-daily attacks on our basic legal, ethical, and constitutional rules and norms,” says Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). “Investigating these threats to the rule of law is an obligation of Congress and a core function of the House Judiciary Committee. We have seen the damage done to our democratic institutions in the two years that the Congress refused to conduct responsible oversight. Congress must provide a check on abuses of power. 
“Equally, we must protect and respect the work of Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller, but we cannot rely on others to do the investigative work for us. Our work is even more urgent after senior Justice Department officials have suggested that they may conceal the work of the Special Counsel’s investigation from the public,” Nadler adds.
Mueller and his team are investigating whether there was any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, in an attempt to tilt the 2016 presidential election to Trump.
Trump and his allies have long complained about the Mueller probe, with Trump repeatedly tweeting that it is a “witch hunt.”
Mueller, however, is a lifelong Republican and a well-regarded investigator who was appointed FBI director under President George W Bush.

595,House Dems Push Back on ‘Secret’ White House Climate Committee,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/environment/house-dems-push-back-on-secret-white-house-climate-committee/,"A quartet of House Committee leaders have sent Donald Trump a letter expressing concern and raising questions over the reported formation of a secret climate change committee within the National Security Council (NSC).
The purported formation of this “secret” committee would be to counter the scientific consensus on climate change and question its impacts on the national security of the United States.
Trump has long been hostile to the scientific consensus of human-generated climate change, going so far as to begin effort to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accords, aimed at reducing worldwide emissions of greenhouse gasses.

The letter was sent by Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ), Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.), Natural Resources Chairman Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), and Science, Space, and Technology Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.).
“The decision to convene this NSC panel represents yet another action by your Administration in a line of many that run counter to the overwhelming scientific consensus on the causes and impacts of climate change,” wrote the four Democratic committee chairs. “Given the previous statements you have made that fly in the face of explicit scientific evidence and the findings of your own [Defense Department] and Director of National Intelligence, we have serious concerns about any effort to construct a secret committee to question the basic scientific fact of climate change.”
The letter also highlights concerns about the reported involvement of scientist William Happer, who appears to be leading the efforts to undermine the consensus regarding the national security implications of climate change, the congressional Democrats say.
“Dr. Happer does not have the qualifications to serve on a working group that should be composed of climate scientists, if it is to exist at all. Dr. Happer is an atomic physicist, not an expert on climate, and his statements on climate change have been repeatedly debunked by actual climate scientists,” the committee chairs continued.
The full text of the letter can be found here.

The involvement of Happer leading this effort is all the more puzzling since the Senate confirmed meteorologist Kelvin Droegemeier, in January, to the post of director of White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).
The director of OSTP traditionally functions as a president’s science adviser and would typically oversee such an effort.
Particularly, in a case such as this, Droegemeier has the background of a meteorologist. Indeed, he is the first non-physicist to hold the OSTP director post.
Also, Droegemeier was confirmed two years into the Trump administration, a new record. Most presidential science advisers are in position much, much sooner.

596,Trump Praises Human Rights Abuser Kim Jong Un as ‘Real Leader’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/trump-praises-human-rights-abuser-kim-jong-un-as-real-leader/,"Washington Post columnist Max Boot was seen recently on the CNN program “Anderson Cooper 360,” where he criticized President Trump for Trump’s praise of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump had called Kim a “great leader” and saying it was an honor to be with him during their recent meeting in Vietnam.
Discussion on the CNN program turned negatively, citing that Kim had violated human rights and was responsible for the deaths of many people.
Cooper began by saying that Trump might have wanted to “not alienate Kim Jong-un for the greater good.”
However, he then goes on and says, “…there are ways to not alienate Kim Jong-un and continue negotiations or continue involvement without praising him as, you know, a real leader, you know, a great guy.”
Boot then goes into how Trump “has an endless appetite for flattery,” and, “he [Trump] imagines by flattering these foreign dictators he can manipulate them.” He condemned Trump’s actions, saying, “It’s degrading. It’s humiliating.”
Otto Warmbier’s family also released statements saying that, “Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto…Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity…No excuse or lavish praise can change that.”
Warmbier was the American citizen who died in North Korea’s custody.

Trump had described Kim as, “a real personality and he’s very smart. He’s sharp as you can be, and he’s a real leader, and he’s pretty mercurial.”
Former vice president Joe Biden also called Kim Jong Un and Trump’s relationship a “love affair” and that “our national reputation is being tarnished.”
On the other hand, conservative writer Rachael Kisman supported Trump saying that “Trump was right to praise him. If you are meeting with someone who is new to foreign relations, you need to make him feel welcome. And by praising him, Trump was making it easier to get us a good deal.”
“Trump was establishing a good relation with Kim Jong Un, which is very important when trying to make a major deal,” Thomas Jacobs, a political marketing expert added, “and of course, the media makes a huge deal of something tiny — because it is Trump.”
Trump also claimed he had been “misinterpreted.” Then again, Trump has been known to make friends with human right abusers. For example, during March of 2018, Trump congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin on his reelection, despite being specifically told not do so. Trump, in the past, has also tweeted, “…Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing…….”
While Trump has strived for friendship with Kim Jong Un and Putin, he has also inconsistently enforced his “America First” policy, including pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement, and possibly, the North America Free Trade Agreement.
While some people applauded Trump’s progress, most people still responded negatively to Trump’s praising.

VIDEO FULL TRANSCRIPT
ANDERSON: Joining us is USA Today columnist Kiersten Powers. Michael Caputo, and Max Boot, “Washington Post” columnist and author of The Corrosion of Conservatism, Why I Left The Right. Max, I don’t even know what to ask. But why do you think this — is it just he’s trying to gain leverage in negotiations and not alienate Kim Jong-un for the greater good? I guess that’s one argument. But the negotiations have broken down. He seems to genuinely — I mean, there are ways to not alienate Kim Jong-un and continue negotiations or continue involvement without praising him as, you know, a real leader, you know, a great guy.
BOOT: “Exactly right, Anderson. I think the problem fundamentally here is that Donald Trump has an endless appetite for flattery. So he imagines that because he knows he can be manipulated by people who flatter him, he imagines by flattering these foreign dictators he can manipulate them. That theory, there’s no evidence to support it. Look at what happened in Hanoi. It doesn’t matter how often Donald Trump says he’s best buddies with Kim Jong-un. At the end of the day, Kim really likes having nuclear weapons. He’s not going to have them up no matter how much he’s flattered, but Donald Trump has not stopped flattering him. This is obscene. It’s degrading. It’s humiliating. I get that sometimes you have to deal with unpleasant leaders, but when FDR met with Josef Stalin, he didn’t feel compelled to exonerate Stalin from the crimes of the gulag or the Ukrainian famine. You can deal with these leaders and keep your dignity, but Donald Trump does not.”

597,"Experts: Trump Made Summit Mistakes, But Was Right To Walk Away",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/experts-trump-made-summit-mistakes-but-was-right-to-walk-away/,"Donald Trump and his administration made two key mistakes which helped contribute to his summit this week with the leader of North Korea falling apart, according to the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
However, Trump was right to walk away from the table in Hanoi when he did. That was according to a separate interview with Bill Richardson, who served as United Nations ambassador during the Clinton administration and also personally involved himself in diplomacy with leadership in North Korea, which has long been an extremely impoverished, pariah nation.
Trump this week travelled to Vietnam for his second face-to-face meeting with Kim Jong Un, in an attempt to reach an accord to end the North’s long-standing nuclear weapons and missile programs. It was the second such meeting for the pair, following their first summit last year in Singapore.
The meeting abruptly fell apart on the second day with no agreements in hand.

Going into the summit, Trump and his team made two “critical mistakes,” said Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
“Despite the great work of the Special Envoy Steve Biegun to set the meeting up, there was no detailed listing of the nuclear sites and the nuclear facilities that are really the heart of our discussions,” Reed explained. “Typically for a meeting–and President Reagan had many meetings with [Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev, but they went in with pretty detailed guidelines or pathways that they were going to pursue. They didn’t have this in this case.
“The second mistake in Singapore, President Trump, I think, sent the signal to Kim Jong-un that this is all going to be a one-on-one private conversation,” Reed added. “‘You can ask me and I’ll give it to you.’ Particularly with respect to the military exercises. When the president conceded, off the cuff, that we wouldn’t have military exercises–in fact, described them as provocative war exercises [at the Singapore meeting], I think that sent the wrong signal to Kim Jong-un. I think he said, ‘I don’t need this preliminary negotiations, I’m just going to sit down with him and ask him to take off sanctions, he’ll probably do it.’ And so, the setting was all wrong.”
The result was a miscalculation, Reed added.
Despite everything, Trump was right to leave when he did. That’s according to Bill Richardson, who served as United Nations ambassador in the Clinton administration, and is someone who personally himself engaged in diplomacy with North Korean leadership over the years.
“It was a setback for both sides, but I think the president was right in walking away,” Richardson said, adding that the strongest tool that the United States retains in negotiations with North Korea is economic sanctions.

“The reality is that I don’t think North Koreans were ready to take any significant steps to dismantle. That is the keyword. … They were ready may be to freeze some of their nuclear facilities, destroy one, which I have been to. I don’t think it’s that significant anymore.”
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is correct that the two nations should allow negotiations to continue, Richardson said.
“You’ve got to keep negotiations going. At a lower level, not on the presidential level,” Richardson added.
Reed and Richardson each made their remarks during separate segments on Fox News.

598,"If Cohen Testimony Accurate, Trump Lied Under Oath, Fox Analyst Says",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/if-cohen-testimony-accurate-trump-lied-under-oath-fox-analyst-says/,"If the testimony that Donald Trump’s former attorney and “fixer” delivered to a congressional committee this week is the truth, then the president lied under oath, according to Andrew Napolitano, senior judicial analyst at Fox News.
Early in his all-day public appearance Wednesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Michael Cohen revealed that during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump associate Roger Stone informed Trump that the WikiLeaks group would be publicly dumping Democratic National Committee emails. Trump, Cohen said, told Stone that he approved of such a dump to politically damage opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Napolitano acknowledged that Cohen has a history of telling previous lies, and now asks to be believed.

“But if he’s that kind of a monster, Mr. President, why did you keep him around for 10 years?” Napolitano asked.
The bottom line, however, is that Cohen’s testimony “paints a potentially grave picture for the president,” Napolitano said.
Napolitano’s analysis is particularly stinging for Trump, as he is not a usual critic of the president.
If Cohen is accurate, Trump now is in jeopardy related to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign to tilt the 2016 election toward Trump, according to Napolitano.
“If the conversation he says he overheard with Roger Stone is true, then the president lied under oath because the president swore to the accuracy of his answers to the written questions from Bob Mueller, one of which was: ‘Did you speak to Roger Stone about [WikiLeaks leader] Julian Assange?’ Answer — no.
“If what Michael Cohen says is true, that the president knew about the meeting with the Russians in Trump Tower in June 2016, then he lied under oath, because he told Bob Mueller he didn’t know about it,” Napolitano concluded.

599,Rep Swalwell: It’s ‘An Understatement’ Lawmakers Continue To Learn New Things From Cohen,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/crime/rep-swalwell-its-an-understatement-lawmakers-continue-to-learn-new-things-from-cohen/,"Michael Cohen, the former Donald Trump attorney and “fixer,” turned on his former boss this week to testify in an extraordinary day-long public hearing in which he offered a number of key allegations of ethical lapses and potential felonies committed by the president of the United States.
Although his televised appearance Wednesday before the House Oversight and Reform Committee will likely be what Cohen will be most remembered for, it was by no means the limit of his cooperation with Congress.
The day before, Cohen had sat for a nine-hour, closed-door interview with the Senate Intelligence Committee, in which he covered a variety of topics, including lies he initially the committee when he first testified in 2017 about how far the Trump Tower Moscow project deliberations extended into the 2016 campaign, according to press reports.
“At this time I really appreciate the opportunity that was given to me to clear the record, and to tell the truth,” Cohen told reporters once his Senate appearance was complete.

Then, on the Thursday, the day after his public hearing, Cohen sat with the House Intelligence Committee for another closed-door session.
Speaking with Wolf Blitzer on CNN after that Thursday session, committee member Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) said it “would be an understatement” that the committee received new information from Cohen on Thursday.
“We learned a lot of new things,” SwalwelI said. “I can’t go into them. We’re still interviewing him, he’s coming back next week. There’s very valuable new leads that we learned and he has been asked to bring back some documents to corroborate what he has told us. But we did find him to be cooperative and answered every question we asked.”
Cohen will return to speak with the House Intelligence Committee on March 6.
Then, on May 6th, Cohen is to report to prison to begin his three-year sentence for conviction on two felonies.

600,"America, Please Don’t Try Socialism",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/america-please-dont-try-socialism/,"As an American married to a Frenchman and living in France I can tell you first hand that there several disadvantages to socialism.
First, there is no precise goal for the Socialists other than to get more.  More money, more programs, more vacation time, more free housing.  Just more.  They are voracious but regularly crucify anyone or entity for any success since it surely came from vicious greed, corruption, or outright exploitation.  This hypocrisy goes unnoticed. 
They are never satisfied and it is a fundamental mistake to think that you can negotiate an end to their demands.  Some of ‘perks’ include government-run health care (which is great if you live in a city and can wait ungodly amounts of time to get an appointment), pension systems, tuition-free universities (whose professors, staff and students constantly strike against for more benefits), and access to free or hugely subsidized housing.
Citizens who work are taxed at one of the highest rates worldwide to feed ever-expanding welfare programs.  The average full-time wage-earner in France earns 2,998 Euro per month gross (2,250 net).  My husband earns more and therefore pays more.  Which is fine.  In fact, we pay 41% income tax.  His pay stubs aren’t at all what Americans are used to. 

His pay stubs are two sheets of A4 paper listing line item after line item of taxes.  Not only does the social system require higher ‘contributions’, but we also pay a 20% sales tax (or Value Added Tax).  The sales tax alone should make most Americans rethink installing a truly Socialistic system vs the quasi-socialistic system they currently have.  The French system requires that many products are taxed at high rates. The French pay nearly 4 times what Americans pay for a gallon of gas. 
And here’s the big rub: The overall result has been most devastating to the poorest in France.  Unemployment is massive, wages are extraordinarily low, and the incentive for entrepreneurs to risk everything to create something new is crushed under the promise of enormous corporate tax (which is why people get their free education in France and take those skills to the USA to become an entrepreneur). 
Like many cultures and under many governments, the poorest pay the highest in quality of life and opportunity, and the middle class support the bulk of the social programs via taxes.
I hear a lot on social media from Americans who want what I’ve got.  Free healthcare.  First and very importantly, it’s anything but free.  We prepay for healthcare not just for ourselves but our neighbors.  That’s ok.  But the doctors in France are paid a government salary.  They go to school for the same amount of time as an American doctor but have zero hopes of earning what American doctors earn. 
French doctors are distributed based on population requirements.  So depending on where you live you probably wait weeks to see a general practitioner and will definitely wait much longer to see a specialist.  Need new eyeglasses?  No problem.  The first appointment to see an ophthalmologist is 9 months out.  To see a cardiologist in my region is an eight-month wait.  When I openly gasped at the wait time, the response was, “If there’s something really wrong with you go to the hospital”.  So, in fact, that’s what most French do.  The hospitals are sorely understaffed and overused.  

Additionally, Socialism has left charities and the idea of being charitable sorely wanting.  People are less inclined to be generous with others because they’ve already pre-paid for social programs.  It has created an intolerance and sometimes downright disdain for others.  This is particularly true of immigrants. 
Americans pride themselves on being nice.  They pride themselves on being generous.  And most importantly Americans and her immigrants love the opportunities that are available in the US.  It’s all about the American dream.  American has profited greatly by encouraging and integrating immigrants into her culture, her workforce, and her very basic identity.
There is a French version of the American dream.  Though it’s more a nightmare than a dream for the working French.  As an immigrant in France one is required by law to attend several courses about French civics, history, and culture.  These courses are only available in the French language by the way, and an appointment with a local Prefecture must be made to attend.  The Prefecture in my department is only open to take appointments from 9:10 am to 12:00 and only on Tuesdays.  It is a first come first served situation.  And it is amazingly frustrating.
But what’s most interesting isn’t the absolute lack of efficiency on the part of the governmental offices, it’s the conversation that I found myself in during the part of the course that teaches immigrants where to register for a job once their visa is approved.  In a room of 21 immigrants primarily from the Middle East and Africa (3 of us from Russia and the US), there were plenty of examples in diversity. That wasn’t a surprise. 

What was a surprise was that when the instructor asked for a show of hands of those of us who would be seeking work.  Only 2 hands went up.  Mine and another woman from Russia.  The instructor asked the others what they intended to do in France.  The bold answer was, and this a direct quote from one of the other attendees, “I’m only in France for the free house and a check”.  I was stunned. 
I’ve never in my life heard an immigrant to the US utter such a thing.  The immigrant friends that I have in the US and others I’ve met or worked with came to the US for the opportunity to provide for themselves and their families.  The came to the US to work, to build something, to find their own piece of the American Dream. 
The United States has numerous social programs to help those need.  But I can’t imagine that Americans, with their can-do spirit and general optimism, would want a truly Socialistic state that leads to a lack of ambition, an overall malaise of its citizens, a decrease in charity, and a marketing message to people worldwide stating Come To America – Land Of The Free Ride.

601,The 2020 Democratic Nomination: A Tale of Two Contests,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-2020-democratic-nomination-a-tale-of-two-contests/,"The field of candidates only seems to widen, but the state of Iowa seems more than happy to accommodate, and to take up its quadrennial tradition as the first-in-the-nation caucus state.
Travel to most other states, and voters know the candidates from the news and a seemingly endless barrage of back-and-forth campaign ads.
But no, not in the handful of earliest states on the primary and caucus-going calendar, which is still almost a full year away from kicking off. But once it does, Iowa certainly will be one of those very special states. There, voters expect not only to see the candidates up close and in person–they expect a kind of wooing, a sort of political courtship.
“Iowans do expect to have kind of a relationship with candidates and people say, well, oh, you’ve met so and so. Yeah, but I haven’t met them three or four times. I can’t make up my mind yet. We’re in that stage right now,” explains Kathie Obradovich, political columnist for the Des Moines Register.
All of the many Democratic hopefuls are attracting big crowds, even during blizzard conditions, Obradovich says.
“We’ve had a terrible winter here in Iowa, but people are actually turning out in the snow to see these candidates. I think they’re just sizing them up now,” she says.
It’s impressive if you run into an Iowan who can name all the candidates, says Obradovich.
“You need a bingo card to keep track of all of them. It’s something Iowans take seriously and they are going to be interested in policy as well as personality,” she says. “I personally hope that Iowans will pay a lot more attention to policy than personality this time around. Ultimately I think it’s — the strong personalities are going to stand out first and so you’ve got Elizabeth Warren, you’ve got Kamala Harris, even Amy Klobuchar well-known to Iowans, those personalities, Cory Booker, because they’re entertaining and interesting to go see.”
The latest entrant to the competition faces a unique challenge, however, according to Obradovich.
That would be Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is making his second run for the nomination.
“Iowans have a long relationship with Bernie Sanders. I am getting the feeling that people are not that excited yet about Bernie Sanders’ candidacy,” she says. “I think he will have to bring something new this time.”
If Iowa represents steady and traditional in this race, California is sure to bring disruption and the unexpected.
Last year, before leaving office, Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed a law that moves California’s primary way up on the calendar, to March 3, the earliest allowed without interfering with the traditional “early states.”
That means that California will play a whole new role of importance next year, according to political reporter and blogger Charlie Pierce.
Specifically, Pierce expects the earlier California primary to significantly winnow the field because candidates are “going to need a truckload of money to compete there,” he says.
“I think that that’s going to be the money primary and you will see if it’s a 20-person field, I think you’re going to see that cut in half after California,” Pierce predicts.
Obradovich and Pierce made their remarks during separate recent segments on MSNBC.

602,"In Congressional Testimony, Cohen Portrays Trump as Mob-Style Criminal",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/law/in-congressional-testimony-cohen-portrays-trump-as-mob-style-criminal/,"Michael Cohen–months away from reporting to prison for his role in the crimes–painted a picture Wednesday of his long-time former boss, President Trump, as a Mob-style figure who certainly was aware of at least a certain level of foreign collusion in the 2016 presidential election.
Cohen, once Trump’s trusted attorney and fixer, delivered his testimony under oath in an extraordinary open hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.
Cohen began by asking for protection from the committee for his family for threats made against them. He also acknowledged that his own credibility could easily be questioned as a result of his past lies, which is why he said he brought evidence before the committee to bolster his allegations.
“Never in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to
work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for President, launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win,” Cohen told lawmakers, by way of introduction. “I regret the day I said ‘yes’ to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave
him along the way.
“I am ashamed of my own failings, and I publicly accepted responsibility for
them by pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York,” he added.
“I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty – of the things I did
for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him.
“I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump’s illicit acts
rather than listening to my own conscience.
“I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat,” Cohen continued.
And in what would be his first real revelation of the day, Cohen said of Trump, “He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking
with [WikiLeaks leader] Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.”
According to Cohen, he witnessed Trump associate Roger Stone tell President Trump that he had just spoken with Assange, and that there would be a “massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.” Cohen said that Trump replied, “wouldn’t that be great.”
That would be but the first of a laundry list of misdeeds and wrongdoing alleged by Cohen, often with some form of corroboration to back him up.
Cohen produced to the committee a personal check with Trump’s signature, dated when the president was in office, that reimbursed Cohen for the illegal hush-money payments he made to adult film star known as Stormy Daniels, with whom Trump allegedly had an extramarital affair.  Cohen testified that this was one of 11 checks he received from President Trump or his trust.  Even after writing these checks, Trump publicly denied knowing anything about the hush-money payments.
Cohen also produced a check from the Trump Trust signed by Donald Trump, Jr. and Trump Organization executive Alan Wiesselberg on March 17, 2017. This check was written after President Trump held a press conference announcing that he was no longer exercising control over the Trump businesses. Cohen testified that Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., and Weisselberg were all active participants in this financial conspiracy.
Cohen confirmed the inaccuracy of the information provided by the president’s lawyer about these payments to federal officials at the Office of Government Ethics (OGE). The president’s lawyer indicated to OGE that the payments were made pursuant to a retainer agreement, but Cohen testified that no such agreement existed—testimony confirmed by federal prosecutors.
Cohen testified that Trump “knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it.” According to Cohen, he personally discussed the issue with Trump “at least a half-dozen times” during the campaign.  Cohen also briefed Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump, Jr. about the project “in the regular course.”  
Cohen said that President Trump met with Cohen at the White House to discuss his upcoming testimony before the congressional Intelligence Committees in 2017.  He testified that the president reinforced the message he expected Cohen to follow. The existence of this meeting, which also included the president’s personal lawyer, was corroborated by an internal White House email on May 16, 2017, which was reviewed by committee members. The email stated:  “POTUS requested a meeting on Thursday with Michael Cohen and [Trump attorney] Jay Sekulow.”
Cohen testified that Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited a draft of his false written statements to Congress on efforts to build Trump Tower Moscow during the 2016 campaign. Cohen testified that these lawyers wanted him to stay “on message” by minimizing the extent of negotiations and the involvement of President Trump.
Cohen stated that Trump provided inflated financial statements to Deutsche Bank while seeking a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills professional football team. Cohen produced the president’s financial statements that reportedly were falsely inflated. Those statements show Trump claimed to have boosted his net worth by more than $3 billion over just nine months. Cohen told the committee that Trump “inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.
Cohen disputed Trump’s claim that he cannot release his tax returns because he is under audit. Cohen said that Trump told him the real reason he has refused to release his tax returns is because he is afraid that “tax experts” will “run through his tax return and start ripping it to pieces” and that the president would then be audited and forced to pay additional taxes and penalties.
Next Steps in the Investigation
Also Wednesday, committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) sent a letter to former Deputy White Counsel Stefan Passantino and a letter to Trump’s personal attorney Sheri Dillon requesting that they appear for transcribed interviews.
The committee released new documents on February 15, showing that both attorneys were involved in a call in which Dillon appeared to provide inaccurate information to the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) relating to the president’s hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, according to the committee.
Cohen himself must now report to prison May 6, to begin serving a three-year sentence for two convictions: fraud and perjury.

603,Top Foreign Policy Democrat Left Confused as Trump Digs Into Kim Summit,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/top-foreign-policy-democrat-left-confused-as-trump-digs-into-kim-summit/,"In Vietnam, Donald Trump rekindled his relationship with the autocratic leader of North Korea as the two men prepared for what would be the final, and hopefully, more substantive day of their second face-to-face summit.
But half a world away, Trump had jetted off to his meeting with Kim Jong Un leaving behind a ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee confused, and frankly concerned, about Trump’s approach to diplomacy with Kim, known as the brutal leader of an incredibly isolated and poor nation.
The Trump/Kim summits–which began last year in Singapore with the historic first-ever meeting between a North Korean leader and a sitting US president–are ostensibly to work to an agreement whereby North Korea abandons its ambition to be a nuclear power. North Korea has been developing an increasingly potent military nuclear capability for the past several decades.
Trump and Kim initially agreed to meet only after the pair traded insults. Trump called Kim “Rocket Man,” in apparent reference to the missiles North Korea would test-fly in an apparent show of strength. Kim, in turn, referred to Trump as a “dotard.”
The two men apparently have put that former animosity behind them.
“I’m somewhat puzzled,” said Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, top Democrat on the foreign affairs panel. “Look, we all recognize that diplomacy is the way to solve the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula. So we all encourage discussions. But for a summit meeting to take place, you expect to see concrete progress on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
Cardin made his remarks during a segment on CNN a few days before Trump left for his trip.
However, that first summit in Singapore “produced virtually no results in regards to denuclearization.,” Cardin says.
“The first step on denuclearization is acknowledgment and statement of the nuclear program in the North, you need to have that assessment, need to have international inspectors, you need a game plan in order to denuclearize. We didn’t see that after Singapore,” he adds.
“I hope what we see after the Hanoi summit is a concrete acknowledgment of North Korea’s nuclear programs, we’ll have an opportunity for international inspectors, and specific game plan how they’ll achieve denuclearization,” he says.

604,"A Trailblazer of a Mother, Duckworth Wants To Extend Help to Other Moms",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/a-trailblazer-of-a-mother-duckworth-wants-to-extend-help-to-other-moms/,"Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) has broken so many barriers and notched so many firsts in her career: the first Asian-American elected to Congress from Illinois, first woman with a disability to be elected to Congress, the first female double amputee in the Senate, and the first member of Congress born in Thailand.
So perhaps it was fitting that last year Duckworth became the first senator to give birth while in office, to a daughter, Maile.
Soon after little Maile’s birth, Senate rules were changed so as to allow infants under one year of age to be allowed on the Senate floor so as to be breastfed.
The day after the rule change, young Maile became the first baby brought onto the Senate floor.
Duckworth wants to bring that sort of added assistance to all new mothers with a piece of new legislation she is co-sponsoring.
Duckworth joined Sens. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in introducing the Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act, which would help ensure new parents have access to clean and private lactation rooms when visiting federal buildings around the nation.
Duckworth says that the new bill would build on the success of her FAM Act, which was signed into law last year and ensures all large- and medium-sized airports have lactation rooms for new mothers.
“Breastfeeding has long-lasting health benefits that protect mothers and children from illnesses, which is why we should continue to build on the progress made by the FAM Act in making it easier for moms and children to find clean and accessible spaces to express breastmilk,” says Duckworth. “I’m pleased to join Senator Daines in introducing this bipartisan legislation requiring these spaces in all public federal buildings.”
The Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act would require that federal buildings that are open to the public and contain a public restroom provide a lactation room, other than a bathroom, that is hygienic and is available for use by members of the public who are breastfeeding.
According to the legislation, the lactation room must be shielded from view, be free from intrusion, and contain a chair, a working surface, and–if the building is supplied with electricity–an electrical outlet.
“Mothers who are breastfeeding should have a private, clean, and safe place to go in federal buildings,” Daines says. “This bill provides this important resource to new moms.”

605,"Thinking About The ‘Green New Deal’, Ky. Congressman Encourages People To Think Big",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/environment/thinking-about-the-green-new-deal-ky-congressman-encourages-people-to-think-big/,"Perhaps not all of its proposed provisions ultimately will probably make it into law, but the so-called “green new deal” is just the kind of thinking the nation needs if it is to successfully grapple with the growing challenge of climate change.
So says Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), who explains that he had an experience similar to that of Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who recently made news for a tense encounter with a group of young people at her office, who were hoping to persuade her to vote for the green new deal.
Promoted by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and others–including some of those running for the Democratic nomination for president–the green new deal is a collection of clean energy initiatives as well as some economic proposals. Its main goal is to dramatically cut emissions of the greenhouse gasses responsible for global climate change.
Feinstein, however, turned the kids down flat, telling them, “I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’m doing.”
Yarmuth, newly the chairman of the House Budget Committee, says that he looked at his meeting with young people interested in the green new deal rather differently.
“The way I look at it is there is a growing understanding in the country and particularly among young people that gradualism and incrementalism is not enough to deal with the huge challenges,” Yarmuth says. “Climate change being one. People are thinking big and dramatic. I think that is important.”
By the same token, he concedes “not everything is realistic” with the initiative.
However, “it has really good aspirational initiatives that I think we need to be talking about,” the congressman says.
Yarmuth made his remarks during a recent segment on MSNBC.
Even if the Democratic-controlled House we’re to approve even part of the green new deal, it would not be approved by the current Republican Senate.
Further, Donald Trump has made it clear that he has no interest in tackling climate change, particularly since he has taken steps to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accords.

606,House Chairmen Ask Trump To Lift Veil of Secrecy on N. Korea Talks,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/house-chairmen-ask-trump-to-lift-veil-of-secrecy-on-n-korea-talks/,"Donald Trump has arrived in Vietnam for the start of his second summit with the leader of North Korea. But days before he left on that trip, a trio of House national-security chairmen told Trump to come clean on information surrounding his diplomacy with Kim Jong Un.
Congress is so in the dark, they say, that they still aren’t up to speed on last year’s historic summit between Trump and Kim, which was the first such encounter between a North Korean leader and a sitting president of the United States.
The bilateral meetings are ostensibly about de-nuclearizing North Korea, which for decades, has been working to become a nuclear power.
North Korea has become both a pariah and highly isolated nation since the end of the 1950-1953 Korean War. The North is the target of strict and crippling economic sanctions.
Although a cease-fire ended hostilities of the Korean War, there was no armistice which means North and South Korea remain, technically, in a state of war more than 60 years later.
In a letter to Trump, Chairmen Eliot Engel, of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Adam Smith of the Committee on Armed Services, and Adam Schiff of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence emphasized that the administration has failed to brief Congress on the negotiations since the June 2018 Singapore summit, has cut off Congress’s access to intelligence regarding North Korea’s nuclear and conventional weapons, and has ignored law requiring a report to Congress on North Korea’s nuclear program.
The lawmakers also raised the growing concern that Trump and his top intelligence officials appear at odds when it comes to the progress being made on this matter.
“We are perplexed and troubled by the growing disconnect between the Intelligence Community’s assessment and your administration’s statements about Kim Jong Un’s actions, commitments, and intentions,” the chairmen write. “Furthermore, our ability to conduct oversight of U.S. policy toward North Korea on behalf of the American people has been inappropriately curtailed by your administration’s unwillingness to share information with Congress.”

607,Democratic Lawmakers Seeking Fresh Corruption Probe at Beleaguered EPA,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/environment/democratic-lawmakers-seeking-fresh-corruption-probe-at-beleaguered-epa/,"Democrats in both the House and Senate are calling for a new investigation into alleged corruption at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has been caught in a cloud of misconduct going as far up as former administrator Scott Pruitt’s 14 or more federal investigations into potential wrongdoing, including his rental of a condo in Washington D.C. at a deeply discounted rate from a lobbyist whose clients were regulated by the EPA.
House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) and Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Tom Carper (D-Del.) have asked the acting inspector general of the EPA to investigate whether agency officials William Wehrum and David Harlow helped reverse the agency’s position in a major enforcement action to favor a client of their former law firm.
Wehrum and Harlow, assistant administrator and general counsel respectively for the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, were lawyers at the law firm Hunton & Williams before arriving at the agency. The firm, and Harlow specifically, represented DTE Energy Company as DTE has been fighting the EPA for nearly a decade over air pollution from the company’s coal-fired power plant in Monroe, Mich., the Democrats seeking the probe say.
Ethics rules bar EPA officials from participating in matters involving former clients and clients of their firm, but it appears Wehrum and Harlow may have helped persuade the agency to abandon its position, according to the lawmakers seeking the investigation.
Their efforts came on the eve of consideration of the lawsuit involving DTE by the Supreme Court.
Under the Trump administration, the EPA has taken an extremely anti-regulatory and pro-business stance. The agency has been trying to escape the taint of multiple scandals and wrongdoing which prompted last year’s ouster of top official Pruitt.
“While the underlying facts and legal arguments in the DTE litigation are complicated, the ethics violations are simple and clear: federal employees may not participate in particular matters that involve their former clients or employers,” the lawmakers write in their letter to the acting inspector general. “[Wehrum and Harlow’s former law firm] Hunton & Williams has represented DTE in the DTE litigation since it started in 2010. Shortly after Mr. Wehrum and Mr. Harlow arrived at EPA, the agency abandoned its long-standing position and adopted the views of DTE on the legal issue central to the case, which was then pending before the United States Supreme Court.”
According to emails and other documents reviewed by the lawmakers, Wehrum and Harlow appear to have reviewed and participated in policy discussions relating to a memo changing the EPA’s position on enforcement actions like DTE’s. Reporting in the Washington Post Monday confirmed that Wehrum was actively involved in at least one internal meeting discussing the timing and substance of the memo.
“The memo was widely understood at EPA to about the DTE litigation, the memo itself discussed the litigation, and it was issued expressly to affect the Supreme Court’s decision on whether to grant a writ of certiorari,” the lawmakers add. “The DTE memo is plainly a substantial decision that had a direct and predictable effect on a particular matter involving a client represented by their former law firm.”

608,"While Some Support Medicare-for-all, Other Lawmakers Embrace ‘State Public Option’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/while-some-support-medicare-for-all-other-lawmakers-embrace-state-public-option/,"While much attention on Capitol Hill for the future of progressive healthcare reform is focused on Medicare-for-all, a group of lawmakers is pushing an alternative.
Since Democrats took control of the House in January, many have been looking at how to move beyond the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, and achieve universal coverage.
A single-payer Medicare-for-all approach has been popular among many Democrats, including some of those running for the 2020 nomination for president.
However, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) have joined Reps. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) to introduce the State Public Option Act to create a Medicaid-based public health care option.
The State Public Option Act would allow states to create a Medicaid buy-in program for all residents regardless of income, giving everyone the option to buy into a state-driven Medicaid health insurance plan.  At least 14 states are exploring the implemention of a Medicaid public option within their legislatures, the supporters of the federal bill say.
A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey found broad, bipartisan support for a Medicaid public option, the lawmakers add. Medicaid is a popular and cost-effective program with a large provider network, according to the bill supporters. The program has the same positive ratings as private insurance, but provides health coverage at a much lower cost, they add. Based on partnerships between state and federal governments, Medicaid also gives states the flexibility to adapt services and models of care based on their individual needs, the bill supporters say.

“In the last nine years, the ACA has made progress to reform America’s health care system, but we must do more to help cover 30 million Americans who remain uninsured,” says Durbin. “The State Public Option Act will help expand health care options so that everyone has an opportunity to find affordable coverage.  While the current Administration works to do everything they can to tear down the ACA, this bill will advance the fundamental right of affordable and accessible health care for all Americans.”
Dozens of other Democrats have signed on to co-sponsor the legislation in both the House and Senate, including presidential candidates Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
In at least a couple of cases, Gillibrand and Warren, they seem to be straddling the reform fence as they also have signaled support for Medicare-for-all.
Not surprisingly, not a single Republican lawmaker is associated with the State Public Option Act.
That means that, like much left-leaning reform legislation now taking shape in Congress, this bill could well pass the Democratic House, only to be probably never considered in the Republican Senate.

609,Trump Counter-punches Cancer Patient Reid After Criticism,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-counter-punches-cancer-patient-reid-after-criticism/,"Donald Trump took to Twitter Monday to attack former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid after Reid criticized Trump in an interview with CNN.
Reid, of Nevada, has been struggling with pancreatic cancer.
Monday morning, Trump tweeted: “Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another beauty, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!”
The truth is that Reid was not “thrown out.”
Reid retired on his own in 2017, after 30 years in the Senate. He was succeeded by Sen Catherine Cortez-Masto, a fellow Democrat.
The cause of this latest battle is an interview the 79-year-old Reid granted to CNN personality Dana Bash. Reid–who was a fierce opponent of Republican President George W. Bush during Bush’s years in office–now says he wishes for a Bush presidency “every day” compared to that of Trump.
Also, compared to Trump, Bush would be the Babe Ruth of presidents.
Reid also reports that after extremely brutal chemotherapy–which compromised his vertebrae, damaging his ability to walk on his own–the cancer is in remission. He also says he is feeling “very good.”
Reid today, in retirement, maintains an office in the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.

610,"Facing Disapproval Vote, Trump Warns Senate Republicans of Dem ‘Trap’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/facing-disapproval-vote-trump-warns-senate-republicans-of-dem-trap/,"With a vote in the Republican Senate that’s all that could allow his declaration of a “state of emergency” to stand, Donald Trump is warning the GOP senators not to stray and to vote to defeat the expected resolution of disapproval.
The Democratic-controlled House this week is expected to easily pass a resolution of disapproval against the “state of emergency” Trump declared this month in order to bypass Congress and essentially raid the military budget to finance the border wall Trump craves.
Democrats, and some, Republicans, object to Trump’s declaration as unconstitutional, as violations of the principles of Congress maintaining the power of the purse as well as separation of powers.
As the resolution of disapproval is privileged, that means that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) has no choice but to bring it to a vote.
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, potentially vulnerable when she seeks re-election next year, is the sole Senate Republican to yet publicly commit to vote for the resolution of disapproval when it hits the Senate floor.
More could join her, which Trump certainly wants to prevent. It would take 21 GOP senators to vote for the resolution to create a veto-proof supermajority, assuming that all Senate Democrats were to vote in favor.
In an attempt to prevent that, Trump tweeted: “I hope our great Republican Senators don’t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security. Without strong Borders, we don’t have a Country – and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don’t fall into the Democrats ‘trap’ of Open Borders and Crime!”
Actually, the truth is that most Americans oppose Trump’s plans. Some 61 percent oppose the declaration of a “state of emergency,” and a full 60 percent want it challenged in court, if necessary, according to a NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll.
Additionally, 58 percent say there is no emergency and 57 percent believe Trump is misusing his presidential powers, according to the same poll.
UPDATE: Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina both have now joined Susan Collins of Maine in announcing that they will vote for the resolution of disapproval once it reaches the Senate.

611,Pelosi: Building Trump’s Border Wall ‘Not an Act of Friendship’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/trump/pelosi-building-trumps-border-wall-not-an-act-of-friendship/,"As the House of Representatives prepares to vote on a resolution of disapproval against Donald Trump’s declaration of a “state of emergency,” not only is that declaration unconstitutional, but building Trump’s desired border wall sends a bad signal to the neighbors of the United States to the south, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Pelosi was with Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Tex.) and Mayor Pete Saentz in Laredo, Texas, as part of a look at US border security ahead of House Democrats’ plan this week to pass a resolution of disapproval to stop Trump’s use of a “state of emergency” to bypass Congress, and essentially raid military funds to build his border wall.
The resolution is expected to pass the Democratic-controlled House easily.
Because it is a privileged resolution, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will have no choice but to bring it to a vote. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine–who is potentially vulnerable when she is up for re-election next year–is the sole Senate Republican to commit to voting for the resolution of disapproval.
At least a handful of others is expected to join her. The question is whether enough Republicans desert Trump to override his expected veto of the legislation. Some 21 Republican votes would be required to override the veto, assuming all the Democrats vote for the resolution.
Democrats, and some Republicans, oppose Trump’s use of the emergency declaration on constitutional grounds. They argue that it violates the principle of separation of powers as well as usurping the congressional role of the power of the purse.
Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, certainly supports the resolution of disapproval on those terms.
“This is about the oath we take to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, our Founders very wisely placed in the Constitution provision for the separation of powers,” she said. “Co-equal branches of government, there to be, again, a check and balance on each other.”
But her opposition also is driven for the message that building the wall itself sends, Pelosi says.
“It’s clear that this is not an act of friendship,” she says. ” …We are all in one hemisphere. We are neighbors. Let’s be friends. Let’s respect each other in this hemisphere and I do know that many people in the Congress think that we should have more of a focus on our Latin American neighbors. Canada too, but also to the south of us – Mexico, Central America, and South America.
“So, let’s use this as a pivotal moment not only to uphold the Constitution, uphold our values and how we respect people, but use it as a moment to say, ‘Let’s go down a different path in terms of who we are as a hemisphere,” Pelosi adds. “We are all called Americans, North or South Americans.”
Correction: Henry Cuellar was incorrectly label as an Democrat. He is a Republican

612,Bipartisan Resolution Seeks to Put Heat on Saudi Abuses,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/bipartisan-resolution-seeks-to-put-heat-on-saudi-abuses/,"A bipartisan group of senators, led by Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.) is leading the charge for a Senate resolution that would condemn the ongoing detention of Saudi women’s rights activists arrested after May 2018, and calls for their immediate release. The Rubio-Cardin resolution also calls on President Trump to comply with the congressional request under the Global Magnitsky Act to officially determine the persons responsible for the murder of Saudi journalist and columnist for The Washington Post Jamal Khashoggi.
Human rights abuses in the Saudi kingdom reportedly have been on the rise since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman came to power.
The Rubio-Cardin resolution would:
call the Saudi regime to immediately release and drop any politically motivated charges against the detained Saudi women’s rights activists related to peaceful activities to advance human rights in Saudi Arabia, which are protected under international law;
express concern over the reported use of torture by the Saudi regime against the women’s activists, and urges investigation into such allegations and the holding accountable of perpetrators;
recognize that the strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia is in the national interest of the United States;
reaffirm that the global recognition and protection of basic human rights, including women’s rights, is in the national security interest of the United States;
urge the Saudi regime to reform its laws that restrict basic human rights, including women’s rights, such as by abolishing the male guardianship system;
urge Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to affirm the support of the United States for the right of activists to peacefully advocate for the protection of universal human rights;
call on Trump to press the Saudi regime to immediately release all political prisoners, human rights defenders, journalists, and bloggers, including Raif Badawi, Waleed Abu al-Khair, and others who support religious freedom, and the women’s rights activists detained after May 2018; and
call on Trump to comply with the request submitted under the appropriate subsection of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act for a determination with respect to the persons responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Saudi-born, but a legal US resident, Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi embassy in Turkey, where–once inside–he was ambushed and brutally murdered, likely on direct orders from MBS.
The Magnitsky Act is a 2012 US law, originally passed to punish via sanctions those in Russia responsible for the murder in prison of tax accountant Sergei Magnitsky.
Several years later, the law was expanded and internationalized so as to allow the targeted sanctioning of human rights abuses worldwide.
Lawmakers, for months, have been trying to push Trump to act under the authority of the Magnitsky Act against those responsible for Khashoggi’s murder, including MBS. However, Trump has refused to acknowledge the evidence.
Although he is not associated with the Rubio-Cardin resolution, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) also is calling for Trump’s action under the Magnitsky Act against those responsible for Khashoggi’s murder.
“The question that Congress wants answered is whether any senior Saudi officials, including members of the Saudi royal family, were responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi,” Romney says. “By law, the president is required to report to Congress on these findings and the imposition of sanctions. I am concerned that the Administration has yet to comply with the law, nor has it sufficiently explained why. As has been requested by members of both parties, I urge the Administration to rectify this urgent situation and brief Congress on its progress as soon as possible.”

613,Here are the Best Memes and Jokes About Kim Jong Un,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/here-are-the-best-memes-and-jokes-about-kim-jong-un/,"In 2019, anything can become viral through a meme, from a haircut to a plant, to a person. This includes the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un. After his summit with Trump, memes arose, mocking everything from Kim’s personality to his haircut. Here are the best memes and jokes about Kim Jong Un.
Kim Jong Un faces a group of reporters
Kim Jong Un: I am excited to announce that North Korea will be the first nation to land on the Sun. We have already developed sophisticated technology that will bring humans to the Sun.
Reporter #1: I’ve heard that the Sun is very hot. How will your astronauts survive the heat?
Kim Jong Un thinks for a moment
Kim Jong Un: Well, we will just go when it is dark!
Well, we will just go when it is dark!
All the reporters stand up and start clapping. “What a genius!” shouts one reporter. “Wow! I never thought of that!” exclaims another.
Back in the Oval Office… President Trump is watching the news.
Trump: That man is an idiot. Everyone knows there is no sun when it is dark.
All of Trump’s aides stand up and start clapping. “How equally intelligent..” whispers one aide.

614,Will 2020 Be The Year To Ditch Mitch?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/will-2020-be-the-year-to-ditch-mitch/,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is one of the most powerful officials in Washington.
But back home, Kentucky’s senior senator polls only somewhat more popular than poison ivy and ebola.
Perhaps that’s a bit of a stretch, but, no McConnell is unloved in the Bluegrass State.
He regularly takes the dubious honor of being the most disliked of all 100 senators by the folks back home. His approval in the Bluegrass State is underwater at 38 percent approval and 47 percent disapproval.
Another, more recent, poll pegged McConnell’s approval at an even more dismal 33 percent.
So, then, how has this least popular of politicians survived for more than three decades of re-elections?
“McConnell’s M.O. in Kentucky is not so much to improve his own image as to drag his opponents down to his own level of unpopularity using his vast fundraising ability,” according to one recent profile of McConnell’s career published by New York magazine. “He also has, of course, a general election advantage based on his state’s partisan leanings, which have been trending Republican for a good while.”
McConnell last survived a tough election against a formidable Democrat in 2014. That means he will next face voters next year.
For that task, McConnell’s Democratic counterpart, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is trying to recruit a veteran and fighter pilot, Amy McGrath.
McGrath, 44, could make a formidable opponent. She sought a congressional seat in the 2018 midterm elections. She wound up losing to Republican Rep. Andy Barr, but she made a solid showing in that race.
And the fact that McGrath is a veteran and not a professional politician could make it more difficult for McConnell’s re-election campaign to drag her down to the degree he has with past opponents.
However, that will really depend on if McGrath decides to run at all.

615,The One Power That Guarantees Sanders Will Be 2020 Force,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-one-power-that-guarantees-sanders-will-be-2020-force/,"Bernie Sanders jumped into the fray this week for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and the senator from Vermont has already displayed a singular strength that will assure he will remain a potent force in what has become a very crowded contest.
It’s the same essential power which drove Sanders’ come-out-of-nowhere candidacy four years ago to nearly topple front-runner Hillary Clinton for the nomination.
And, no, this power isn’t Sanders’ impressive fundraising ability–although he did collect about $6 million in the 24 hours after his campaign announcement. (And recall that, overall, he raised some $230 million in total for his entire campaign last time–mostly from small donors.)
No, the power in question is Sanders’ ability to not only diffuse much of the stigma or controversy which comes with his identity as a “socialist,” and the ideas which go with it, but to turn it around to a positive and potent political message.
Recall that four years ago Sanders–a rumpled, somewhat grumpy 70-something-year-old–mesmerized the nation with his barnstorming campaign of rallies which essentially sold democratic socialism to middle America packaged as a positive, uplifting populism. And middle America lapped it up.
Now, jumping into the 2020 nomination contest, into a much more crowded field of rivals than he faced last time, he’s already given voters a taste with a single tweet:
“If someone wants to call me a radical, okay, here it is: I believe people are inherently entitled to health care. I believe people are entitled to get the best education they can. I believe people are entitled to a clean environment.”
Sanders has always had this excellent ability to boil down what could be complex defenses of “socialist” principles to extremely easy-to-understand concepts.
It’s a skill surprisingly few politicians have. Too often, they fall back on the confusing, wonky terminology of their profession–and it turns voters off.
Not Sanders. He fires them up. He can connect with voters on a personal, visceral and relatable level.
The naysayers will carp at the specifics and costs of Sanders’ goals. But here, too, he has the wind at his back. Recent polling suggests a majority of Americans would support the imposition of a new tax on the super-wealthy, those with more than $50 million.
To be sure: there are others among the current Democratic field who are also just as talented and capable in their own ways.
But anyone writing Sanders off as “yesterday’s candidate,” or somehow out-of-place among the current crop of hopefuls would be doing so at their own political peril.

616,Donald Trump’s 2020 Train Wreck,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/donald-trumps-2020-train-wreck/,"Donald Trump recently claimed that the Democrats could not “legitimately win” the 2020 election. As with Trump’s 2018 midterm election predictions, this comment seems more influenced by wishful thinking than any real grasp of reality. More than likely, the 2020 election will turn out to be a train wreck for Trump, and he will be the first president since George H.W. Bush in 1992 to lose his bid for re-election.
According to fivethirtyeight.com, which averages other polls, the percentage of Americans who disapprove of Trump’s performance as president is 53.2%, while the number who approve is 42.5%, putting him at a net -10.8% on approval. True, his numbers have improved a bit since the government shutdown ended, but they remain dismal. Approval numbers more than slightly below 50% are always worrisome for politicians and 42.5% is dismal. A poll by Politico/Morning Consult from early February showed that 52% of voters would definitely or almost definitely vote against Trump in 2020.
Of course, all of the above polling is on the national level. It is the Electoral College that decides elections in the United States, after all. Trump lost the popular vote in 2016, but still pulled out a victory. Shouldn’t he be able to do the same in 2020? Not necessarily. A Feb 6 Morning Consult map of polling in every state shows Trump above water in only 17 states, down from more than 40 in January 2017. States that now disapprove of Trump include not only the three usually-Democratic states that went for him in 2016 (Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin), but also Iowa, Arizona, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, and even ruby-red Utah and Texas. To be sure, Trump will not lose in Texas or Utah, whatever the polls may say, and he  does not need to win all of these states to be re-elected, but he must win the majority. Given that his disapprovals exceed his approvals by 10% in many of these states, this seems wildly unlikely.

Some people have argued that Trump must be the favorite because he is the incumbent. Yet an analysis of the 2018 election results by fivethirtyeight.com showed that incumbency was only about 3% in the 2018 election, and there is no obvious reason to think this will be different in 2020.
Of course, the election is a long way away. Trump could still turn things around, right? Certainly, but there’s no particular reason to think this is likely to happen. Unlike other presidents whose parties took a shellacking in midterm elections, Trump has made no effort to let the country know that he has gotten the message they were trying to send. Nor has he tried to reach out from his base, and most of his recent actions have been highly unpopular.According to a recent NPR/PBS/Marist Poll, only 36% of Americans approved Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency to build a border wall. Earlier polling, such as a Pew poll taken in mid-January showed that 62% of Americans either strongly or somewhat disapproved of Trump’s handling of the shutdown.

An event with even greater potential to impact Trump’s re-electability is the Robert Mueller investigation, which is expected to be released in the next week or so. If the report were to find evidence that Trump actually had committed a crime, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives might well bring impeachment charges against the president. Though it is unlikely that the required 2/3 of the Republican-controlled Senate would go along with removing him, recent polls show that, if Mueller’s report were sufficiently damning, a majority of both Democrats and Independents would support the charges. This situation is very different from that of 1998, when the majority of voters believed that the GOP decision to impeach Bill Clinton was motivated mainly by politics.
By now, any Trump supporters will be screaming that almost all of the evidence presented here is based on polling, and that polls proved spectacularly wrong in 2016. However, the polls in 2016 were not nearly as far off as some people like to claim. They predicted a narrow Clinton win in the Electoral College based on a narrow Clinton advantage in the popular vote. The advantage in the popular vote predicted actually occurred, but failed to translate into an advantage in the Electoral College. That did not exactly make the polling wrong.Besides, even if it had been off, it does not prove that the polls will miss again, any more than a weather prediction that doesn’t come true disproves all weather predictions forever.
Perhaps the most convincing argument piece of evidence against a Trump repeat is the 2016 election. An almost perfect storm of events converged to benefit Trump, but he managed to lose the popular vote and nearly the Electoral Vote nonetheless. His opponent, Hillary Clinton, was both extremely unpopular and a mediocre campaigner. Her overconfident campaign took some key Midwestern states for granted and failed to dedicate the necessary resources to keep them in her camp. According to all U.S. intelligence agencies, Russia was doing its best to help Trump. Finally, FBI Director James Comey made the catastrophic mistake of reopening the investigation into the email scandal less than two weeks prior to election day. Yet Trump still managed to lose the popular vote by three million and barely managed to pull out the Electoral College. To an extent far greater than he or his supporters are willing to admit, Trump has Lady Luck to thank for his 2016 election. In 2020, she is not likely to be so kind.

617,"Fmr. State Official: In 2nd Summit With N. Korea’s Kim, Trump Needs More Than ‘Good Headlines’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/fmr-state-official-in-2nd-summit-with-n-koreas-kim-trump-needs-more-than-good-headlines/,"With his second summit with the leader of North Korea less than a week away, the challenge will be whether Donald Trump is interested in achieving diplomatic progress or simply positive public relations, according to a former East Asian affairs expert at the US State Department.
Trump is set to meet North Korea leader Kim Jong Un on Feb. 27 and 28 in Vietnam to build on the pair’s initial historic summit last year in Singapore.
The previous meeting was the first face-to-face encounter between a sitting US president and a leader of the isolated nation located north of the 38th parallel since the cease-fire ended hostilities known as the 1950-1953 Korean War.
Last year’s summit between Trump and Kim came after an exchange of insults, in which Trump referred to Kim as “Rocket Man” and Kim responded by calling Trump a “dotard.”
The main issue for Trump and Kim is the denuclearization of North Korea.
“After a year of diplomacy with little progress, Trump needs to focus on getting North Korea to make concrete, verifiable concessions on its nuclear program,” says Michael Fuchs, a former State Department official who specializes in East Asian affairs and currently a senior fellow at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress. “Trump needs to show that he’s focused on good outcomes, not just good headlines.”
Fuchs co-wrote an analysis of the North Korea diplomatic situation for the Center for American Progress, and the major points are:
Diplomacy with North Korea is necessary, but effective diplomacy also requires lower-level talks that go on for months; without real diplomacy, summit meetings are a show without substance.
Trump seems to care more about generating headlines than making a good deal, and that behavior is creating a rift between him and the intelligence community.
Since diplomacy began last year, North Korea has taken no concrete actions toward denuclearization and has continued building more nuclear weapons and missiles.
The United States must beware of the possibility that Trump could make a deal that is good for North Korea and bad for the United States as well as our key allies Japan and South Korea.
The United States should make clear that it is willing to change its relationship with North Korea, but only if Pyongyang verifiably changes its behavior.
Trump must focus on human rights and ensure that humanitarian groups can access North Korea.
Of course, its up to Trump to decide what he wants to do with North Korea.

618,"Citizenship Question ‘Would Cause Incalculable Damage,’ ACLU Says",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/citizenship-question-would-cause-incalculable-damage-aclu-says/,"The Trump administration’s plan to add a question to the 2020 Census, asking respondents whether they are US citizens would have dire consequences, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), one of the organizations opposed to the plan.
The plan to add the question, which has been argued in lower courts, now heads to the Supreme Court.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said he wants to add the question at the request of the Justice Department, because it wants better data on the Voting Rights Act.
Opponents say the result of adding the question will not be so benign.
The ACLU says it and it’s allies in its court case presented evidence at trial that the citizenship question was unnecessary and designed to suppress census participation by immigrant communities. Lower turnouts ultimately affect the allocation of congressional seats and billions in federal dollars for services.
According to the government’s own analysis, the decision to add a citizenship question would stop “approximately 6.5 additional million people” from participating in the Census.
A district court decision last month found that, as a result, California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, New York, and Illinois face a “certainly impending” or “substantial risk of losing a seat” in the US House of Representatives and that numerous states would “lose funds from several federal programs.”
“Adding a citizenship question to the census would cause incalculable damage to our democracy,” says Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s Voters Rights Project. “The evidence presented at trial exposed this was the Trump administration’s plan from the get-go. We look forward to defending our trial court victory in the Supreme Court.”
According to a lawsuit by the California state attorney general, “Including the citizenship question on the 2020 Census will directly impede the Bureau from procuring the ‘actual Enumeration’ of the US. population. Numerous studies — including those conducted by the Bureau — point to the same conclusion: asking about citizenship will repress responses from non-citizens and their citizen relatives.”

619,What Happened to Trump as ‘Mr. Hollywood’?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/what-happened-to-trump-as-mr-hollywood/,"Perhaps this, above all, speaks to just how much the presidency has begun to weigh on Donald Trump.
Trump has gone from–at least looking the part of–a media-savvy TV star on his own network series rubbing elbows and dispensing business acumen with Hollywood B-listers, to a nearly incomprehensible and media-illiterate old man.
All within a few short years.
When Trump first ran for president, much of what propelled him was this built-in appeal he had from the years at the head of his own reality series, Apprentice and Celebrity Apprentice. It was the persona from those series, which came into American living rooms for more than a decade, which gave millions of American voters the sense that they knew this man. Trump projected a figure on those series as a strong wheeler-dealer, with his macho tough-guy catchphrase, “You’re fired!”
Trump was even awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his efforts.
Meanwhile, the network which broadcast Trump’s series, NBC, is also home to the long-running sketch comedy show, Saturday Night Live.
Like Trump himself, SNL is very much identified with New York, as it is produced and shot live from NBC’s Rockefeller Center each week. In fact, the flamboyant real-estate developer guest-hosted the show for the first time in 2004. He would return for a second–and much more controversial–go as guest-host as a presidential candidate in 2015. (Activists protested outside as Trump hosted the show inside.)
One of SNL’s longest-standing traditions since it first hit the airwaves in 1975 has been to parody, satire and generally poke good fun at whoever happens to be president of the United States.
And that satire has always been bipartisan. Democrat or Republican, no occupant of the Oval Office has been immune.
It began nearly 45 years ago with comedian Chevy Chase impersonating Jerry Ford. Chase didn’t even bother to look like Ford. He would just stumble and fall down, and immediately, people knew it was the 38th president.
The costumes and impersonations would get more clever and complex over the years.
Sometimes the presidents would even play along.
Ford had the good humor to actually go on the program himself for laughs.
And the recently departed George HW Bush had the class, after he lost the 1992 election, to invite Dana Carvey–the comedian who had been doing the Bush impersonations on SNL–to the White House for some fun.
So it would go to figure that Trump–President Hollywood himself, right?–would be the first one to want to play along.
Wrong.
Actor Alec Baldwin has been getting headlines ever since he took on the Trump persona on Saturday Night Live at the advent of the Trump administration.
Then last December, Trump–a two-time SNL host himself–snapped.
In a series of incoherent tweets, he threatened to sue the series over a Christmas-themed so-called cold-open skit on the sketch comedy program which was essentially a parody of the Jimmy Stewart holiday classic, “It’s A Wonderful Life”, except in the SNL version it imagines a world in which Trump was never elected president. Hilarity ensues from there.
In his tweets raging about SNL, Trump complained about too much “one-sided coverage,” and further raged against “unfair news coverage.”
What?
How could anyone–much less a former host himself–confuse a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch—obviously with actors playing parts–with a network news report of any kind?
Now, another more recent, Saturday Night Live skit seems to have tweaked Trump, as now he tweeted menacingly that SNL “should be looked in to.”
So much for Trump understanding how these celebrity things are supposed to work.
At the very least, if he really is this much of a media hick, somebody needs to take back that star on the Walk of Fame.

620,"A Decade After Clean Energy Investments, Lawmakers Bicker Over ‘Green New Deal’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/a-decade-after-clean-energy-investments-lawmakers-bicker-over-green-new-deal/,"It’s what has become perhaps simultaneously the most often-misunderstood political buzzword and partisan lightning rod: the so-called “green new deal.”
The “green new deal” is embraced by many Democrats–including several top presidential candidates–but held at arm’s length by others. And it’s openly criticized by congressional Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who has a vote scheduled Tuesday, hoping to embarrass Senate Democrats who will have to vote on measures which are not necessarily terribly yet either popular or understood by voters at large. The green new deal is not expected to be approved by this vote in the Republican-dominated Senate.
And, yes, the green new deal–which at it’s heart aims to significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change–does still need to be better explained to the American people.
But supporters should stand firm, and make their case–because the nation has been here before.
Ten years ago, as a matter of fact.
The Great Recession had taken hold, and the nation was hemorrhaging jobs each month.
However, President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress put together a massive economic stimulus program, which came to be known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
Republicans were carping from the sidelines (sound familiar?) but the Recovery Act made the largest single investment in clean energy in history, providing more than $90 billion in strategic clean energy investments and tax incentives to promote job creation and the deployment of low-carbon technologies, according to an Obama-era fact sheet.
The Recovery Act leveraged approximately $150 billion in private and other non-federal capital for clean energy investments.
Clean energy investments made up more than one-eighth of total Recovery Act spending. (Full disclosure: I worked at the US Department of Energy helping to implement Recovery Act spending in the months immediately after the law was signed.)
Supporters of the green new deal ought to build on the successes of the Recovery Act. Its supporters want to see the green new deal reap important economic benefits concurrently to a drop in greenhouse gas emissions, just as the Recovery Act created jobs and improved the US economy in its own way.
Let Mitch McConnell try to play “gotcha” on the Senate floor. It’s nothing Republicans weren’t doing a decade ago. Instead, supporters of a green new deal ought to use McConnell’s vote as an opportunity to educate the American people, that’s it not all about “putting an end to air travel and cow farts.”
If supporters can effectively explain their green new deal, they will have the American people on their side. Public opinion clearly says majorities want action taken to effectively address climate change.

621,"Lawsuits Begin, As Landowners Take ‘The Wall’ To Court",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/lawsuits-begin-as-landowners-take-the-wall-to-court/,"The controversy surrounding Donald Trump’s long-desired wall–and the disputed “state of emergency” which he is using to finance its construction–is rising as landowners in the area of the intended barrier have begun fighting back.
And impacted landowners like them in the region have the support of a Texas Republican member of Congress who represents hundreds of miles of US border with Mexico.
Public Citizen, a Washington DC-based advocacy organization, announced that it has filed a lawsuit in US District Court in the District of Columbia on behalf of a non-profit nature preserve and three landowners in South Texas, who were told that the federal government intends to construct Trump’s border wall on their property if funds are available in 2019.
In a tweet, Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) says that he backs lawsuits against Trump, like that filed by Public Citizen.
“They’re going to sue because, in the great state of Texas, we care about a little thing called ‘private property rights.'”
Trump, at the White House, invoked a 1976 law–the National Emergencies Act–to bypass funding provided by Congress in order to access military funding to secure the funding he wants to build his wall.
Public Citizen’s complaint urges the court to find that Trump exceeded his constitutional authority and authority under the National Emergencies Act, and to hold that the declaration violates the separation of powers doctrine of the Constitution. The court should bar Trump and the Department of Defense from using the declaration and funds appropriated for other purposes to build a border wall, the complaint requests.
The national emergency declaration, signed by Trump Friday, is intended to allow the administration to transfer funds appropriated by Congress for military construction to the building of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border – a wall promised by Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.
“Words have meaning,” says Allison Zieve, Public Citizen’s attorney for the plaintiffs. “The facts make clear that the premise of the president’s declaration – that the absence of a wall in the areas where construction is planned is an ‘emergency’ – is legally untenable and an impermissible basis for seeking to obligate funds that Congress has refused to appropriate for a border wall.”
Trump also said in a press conference announcing the declaration that he “didn’t need to” invoke emergency power to build a wall, but that he “wanted to do it faster.”
Construction of the border wall and an accompanying enforcement zone would destroy a significant portion of the small amount of remaining habitat along the Rio Grande river, Public Citizen alleges.
The Frontera Audubon Society is headquartered on a 15-acre nature preserve in Weslaco, Texas, in the Rio Grande valley. The nonprofit is dedicated to preserving wildlife and the native habitat of the Rio Grande valley – one of the most biologically diverse regions in North America, according to Public Citizen. The valley is a major migration corridor and provides more than three-quarters of America’s bird species with migratory, nesting and feeding habitat, the organization adds.
In addition to the Frontera Audubon Society, the plaintiffs in the suit are:
Nayda Alvarez, a Starr County resident whose home is about 200 feet from the Rio Grande River and just feet away from where the wall would be built. Her lot is adjacent to an approximately six-acre tract of land bordering the river that has been in her family for at least five generations. The suit says that she would be cut off from the portion of her property south of the wall and would lose the use of almost her entire backyard; 
Leonel Romeo Alvarez, a Starr County resident whose home is on an approximately one acre lot adjacent to an approximately six-acre tract of land bordering the Rio Grande river that has been in his family for at least five generations. The suit says he would be cut off from his family’s property south of the wall; and
Yvette Gaytan, a Starr County resident who would lose access to her property south of the wall, according to the lawsuit. The proposed border wall would pass through her property or her family’s property immediately south of her lot.

622,The Only True ‘State of Emergency’ Now Might Be Trump’s Presidency,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-only-true-state-of-emergency-now-might-be-trumps-presidency/,"Donald Trump declared his “state of emergency,” in order to build the wall he claims the nation needs desperately, except that as soon as he was finished declaring this emergency, standing in the Rose Garden, Trump admitted, “I didn’t need to do this…I just want to do it faster.”
What once began as an easy rhetorical device to whip up supporters on the campaign trail has now devolved into a political morass, leaving no one happy–perhaps even Trump himself.
If Trump thought this move to declare a “state of emergency” would simply please the right-wing base to which he is so often attentive, he was surely let down on that count.
Some right-wing leaders came out swinging hard against Trump.
“The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot,” said author and gadfly Ann Coulter.
Trump tried to distance himself from Coulter, saying he “hardly knows” her, to which she responded by tweeting a photo of herself at the podium at a past Trump rally.
Trump’s emergency declaration will likely find itself knotted up in the courts by way of many lawsuits now–possibly for some time to come.
Where judges deciding those suits might have been willing to give Trump deference in declaring his emergency on national security grounds, the president’s stunning White House admission, “I didn’t need to do this,” may well now undercut that deference.
In any event, Trump certainly handed his opponents important legal ammunition. “That quote is going right in the lawsuit,” tweeted former US solicitor general Neal Katyal.
And then there will be Trump’s political battles over his wall.
Polls indicate the broad American public oppose Trump’s move to declare an emergency as a scheme to build a wall on the southern border.
The Democratically controlled House is looking to pass a resolution of disapproval, which Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would be forced to bring to a vote.
And a number of Republican senators have been coming out opposed to Trump’s action declaring the state of emergency. Most Republican senators say that while they back construction of a wall, many also complain that Trump’s declaration is an unconstitutional end-run around the power of the purse, which is to remain the sole domain of Congress.
These Republicans could back the resolution of disapproval, proving a great embarrassment to Trump and perhaps opening a dangerous fissure within the GOP as they all head into an election year.

623,A Wall vs. Fence: Defined by the Merriam Webster,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/a-wall-vs-fence-defined-by-the-merriam-webster/,"One of Trump’s biggest campaign promises was a wall on the America – Mexico border. The recent record-breaking shutdown ended with a 3-week extension for current funding, but the battle for Trump’s wall is still happening.
However, a big controversy arose from 2009 speech where Chuck Schumer, the current Senate Minority Leader, supposedly supported a 700-mile fence around our southern border.  Regardless of whether it is actually true or not, is there really a difference between a wall and a fence?
Wall: noun, \ˈwȯl \
a: a high thick masonry structure forming a long rampart or an enclosure chiefly for defense —often used in plural 
b: a masonry fence around a garden, park, or estate 
c: a structure that serves to hold back pressure (as of water or sliding earth)
one of the sides of a room or building connecting floor and ceiling or foundation and roof
the side of a footpath next to buildings
an extreme or desperate position or a state of defeat, failure, or ruin
a material layer enclosing space 
something resembling a wall (as in appearance, function, or effect) 
especially:something that acts as a barrier or defense
Fence: noun, \ ˈfen(t)s \
archaic:a means of protection: DEFENSE
a barrier intended to prevent escape or intrusion or to mark a boundary
especially:such a barrier made of posts and wire or boards
 an immaterial barrier or boundary
 a receiver of stolen goods
a place where stolen goods are bought
Source: Merriam Webster: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fence, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wall   The definition we are looking would be #1 for wall, and #2 for fence.   Definition #1 refers to a physical structure that is chiefly used for defense. Definition #2 refers to a barrier, both physical and not physical.   Both of these are mainly related to defense.  Furthermore, the Merriam Webster defines a wall as “something resembling a wall (as in appearance, function, or effect),”  Since a fence, in this case, shares the same function as a wall (defense), we can conclude that a fence can be called a wall.
Chuck Schumer VS. Donald Trump
While a wall and a fence are technically the same, the actual specifications for them vary.  Chuck Schumer once said that a 700-mile fence along our border helped curb crime.  On the other hand, Trump wants a 2000+ mile long “wall” along our entire Mexico – U.S. border.

624,Trump’s Declaration of Emergency: Into The Fire?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/trumps-declaration-of-emergency-into-the-fire/,"Donald Trump reportedly will sign the border security spending bill emerging from Congress, in time to avert a second partial federal shutdown, which would have begun Saturday, February 16.
However, since that legislation will provide Trump just a fraction of the funds to construct the waĺl on the southern border which he demands, Trump has said he plans to go ahead with the deeply controversial move of declaring a “state of emergency” in order to circumvent the congressional funding level and repurpose other federal funds toward wall construction.
Although Trump’s move is broadly pleasing to the extent it prevents a second federal shutdown, that is where is where bipartisan agreement ends.
Trump’s move to declare a “state of emergency” surely will soothe his right-wing base.
But beyond that, the wider political fallout from the American public overall over this this emergency declaration has the potential, at least, to make the pushback Trump and the GOP experienced over the previous 35-day shutdown seem like nothing.
To start with, a majority of the American people oppose Trump issuing this emergency declaration. Some 66 percent oppose such a move, while just 31 percent approve, according to a recent Quinnipiac University Poll. Some 3 percent were either unsure or gave no answer.
To be expected, the Democrats in control of the House plan to fight back with everything they’ve got. They intend to pass a joint resolution of disapproval.
“Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that President Trump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for his wall,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement.
“It is yet another demonstration of President Trump’s naked contempt for the rule of law. This is not an emergency, and the president’s fearmongering doesn’t make it one,” the statement adds. “He couldn’t convince Mexico, the American people or their elected representatives to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall, so now he’s trying an end-run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook for it. The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.”
Their joint resolution will be no mere symbolic rebuke, however. Because it is privileged, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would be forced to bring it to a vote.
And that is a vote McConnell could lose.
Many Republican senators are playing it cool for now, but enough of them have raised concerns over Trump’s intended action to pose a problem.
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is among those who have spoken out.
“I’m disappointed with both the massive, bloated, secretive bill that just passed and with the president’s intention to declare an emergency to build a wall,” Paul says.
“I, too, want stronger border security, including a wall in some areas. But how we do things matters. Over 1,000 pages dropped in the middle of the night and extraconstitutional executive actions are wrong, no matter which party does them.”
Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is another Republican who spoke out, tweeting: “We have a crisis at the southern border, but no crisis justifies violating the Constitution.”
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), no stranger to skirmishing with Trump, stopped short of complete opposition for the moment, but made plain he is not pleased.
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Me.), a potentially vulnerable incumbent up for re-election next year, also registered her disapproval.
“Declaring a national emergency for this purpose would be a mistake on the part of the President. I don’t believe that the National Emergencies Act contemplates a President unilaterally reallocating billions of dollars, already designated for specific purposes, outside of the normal appropriations process,” she said. “The National Emergencies Act was intended to apply to major natural disasters or catastrophic events, such as the attacks on our country on 9/11.
“Such a declaration would undermine the role of Congress and the appropriations process; it’s just not good policy. It also sets a bad precedent for future Presidents—both Democratic and Republican—who might seek to use this same maneuver to circumvent Congress to advance their policy goals,” Collins added. “It is also of dubious constitutionality, and it will almost certainly be challenged in the courts.”
With this much discord, Trump has the potential to open a full-scale civil war within his own Republican Party.

But beyond whatever action takes place in Congress, expect potentially many lawsuits filed across the country, should Trump go ahead with his declaration. Each of those lawsuits would seek to block construction of Trump’s waĺl.

625,Live Focus Group: Trump 2019 SOTU Was Mostly A Dud,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/live-focus-group-trump-2019-sotu-was-mostly-a-dud/,"Donald Trump’s much awaited post-federal shutdown State of the Union address failed to deliver much political goodwill or bounce, according to a carefully recruited focus group registering their reactions to Trump’s speech in real-time using a live-dial method.
The political non-profit organization Democracy Corps conducted live dial-meter testing of the 2019 State of the Union address among the so-called “Rising American Electorate”(African Americans, Latinos, white unmarried women, and white millennials), as well as white working class women, and white college women.
Here are some of the key findings, according to a memo Democracy Corps released to detail the focus group findings:
The level of engagement is at levels never seen before. Voters, including those in the dial meter group watched Trump’s address with an extraordinary high level of political engagement, measured by the percent who say they are “almost certain to vote” in the 2020 election. The Rising American Electorate (people of color, unmarried women and millennials) is already more engaged than in the month before the highest midterm turnout election since World War I. African Americans, Latinos, and white millennials are near 100 percent on vote certainty, up by 20 to 30 points from the comparable point last year, and white unmarried women are up 24 points.
The Democratic presidential vote was not eroded and Trump’s job performance gains were unimpressive. The post-SOTU bump in Trump’s job performance was as modest as it was among Rising American Electorate voters in 2017, one of the smallest post-SOTU shifts for a first term president in the organization’s experience dial testing. White millennials, Latinos, and African Americans produced the same modest gains they did in 2018 and 2017, but the white college women remained resolute in their opposition, with virtually no movement on Trump’s performance.
“The president did make bigger gains with the [Rising American Electorate] on his personal favorability, but that was probably the result of the empathy he showed for the many presidential guests and his surprising support for women, affordable health care and paid family leave,” says the Democracy Corps memo.
Trump has lost the immigration battle. The president made immigration and border security the central pitch of his address last night, yet his post-SOTU shift on handling immigration was no bigger than last year’s. He did get a warm response from African Americans and Latinos when praising legal immigration, but even white working-class women were turned off by his exaggerated claims about the danger of the border and migrant caravans. If the goal was to create a new context for a possible shutdown or emergency declaration with this address, then the president failed. The Rising American Electorate voters were only 13 points more favorable towards ‘a wall at the southern border’ at the end of the night (30 to 43 percent warm) which is not significantly better than the temporary gains he made with last year’s address (29 to 39 percent, +9 warmer). At the end of the night, just 32 percent said Trump was doing what was best for the country when it came to the shutdown over the wall.
The biggest gains of the night were on making health care more affordable, but beware of fake promises. President Trump’s commitments to guaranteeing protections for pre-existing medical conditions and to reducing prescription drug prices led everyone to dial up their lines, particularly white work- ing-class women and white unmarried women. Trump’s gains on health care affordability were the big- gest of the night and twice as large as his SOTU-improvement on the issue last year (+12 shift on ‘will make health care affordable’ in 2018 v. +23 shift this year among the Rising American Electorate). But when he tried to say that drug costs declined at a record low rate, the lines took a hit. Voters showed they will only reward results.
Trump saw a rise by recognizing women in the workplace and in Congress. Trump’s recognition of working women, his commitment to paid family leave, and his mention of the historic number of women in the Congress produced some of the highest points in the dials across all groups during the speech. The Democratic women in white who stood in recognition of their progress provided an exciting moment to the white millennials who otherwise were the most immovable focus group. At the end of the night, Trump improved 20 points on being ‘good for women,’ much better than the 5-point shift among these Rising American Electorate voters over the course of last year’s address. But the pollsters suspect they were driven more by the celebrations of the Democratic women, and the president playing along, than anything about his agenda or specific plans. And again, these gains come with the risk he will never support any of these policies that would help working families.
Criminal justice reform delivered a massive boost. The white millennials and African Americans in the group went from hovering below 50 all evening to through the roof when they heard the president introduce former inmate Alice Johnson (pardoned by Trump) and the bipartisan First Step Act, a criminal justice reform law. But to be sure, Trump ended the night in roughly the same place as he did last year among African Americans, with roughly 8-in-10 disapproving. Notably, his speech was far less successful among white millennials compared to last year (+34 approve post-2018, +18 approve post-2019).
These online dial meters were conducted during Donald Trump’s State of the Union address among 206 registered voters nationally: 35 African Americans, 37 Latinos, 29 white millennials, 33 white unmarried women, 33 white working-class women, and 39 white college women. To ensure each demographic was as representative as possible, they were individually recruited, according to the pollsters. Surveys were administered before and after the live dial-meter session. Where compared to 2018 results, the total is among the lines for African Americans, Latinos, white millennials and white unmarried women only.

626,"Republicans, Be Careful What You Wish For",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/republicans-be-careful-what-you-wish-for/,"“They keep coming,” an ominous voice warns one TV commercial. “Two million illegal immigrants in California. The federal government won’t stop them at the border, yet requires us to pay billions to take care of them.”
You might think this was one of the TV spots Donald Trump was running ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, in which he focused incessantly about migrants approaching the southern US border.
It would be a good guess, but you would be about a quarter-century late.
California Republican Gov. Pete Wilson ran that ad as part of his strategy to shore up what was shaping up as a tough re-election race in 1994.
Wilson had tied his hopes for a second term in Sacramento on tying himself to Proposition 187, which proponents like Wilson touted as the “Save Our State (SOS)” initiative.
Prop 187 was a punitive proposed law aimed squarely at “illegal immigrants,” making it illegal for them to access public education, non-emergency healthcare, and many more important services in the state. And, in November 1994, the voters of California approved this ballot initiative overwhelmingly.
A generation later, California is the epitome of the reliable “blue state.” After all, it came as no surprise when Democrat Hillary Clinton trounced Republican Donald Trump in 2016 61.7 percent of the vote to 31.6 percent. California hasn’t given its many dozens of electoral votes to a Republican since George Herbert Walker Bush in 1988.
But it wasn’t always so. California was once one of the most reliably Republican states in the nation. Californians, for decades, voted Republican for president-breaking the streak only to join the LBJ landslide over Barry Goldwater in 1964. The state even went for native son Richard Nixon over the dashing John F. Kennedy in 1960.
Moreover, Ronald Reagan’s governorship of the state was just part of a long line of Republicans in charge in Sacramento, interrupted only by father and son Democrats, Pat and Jerry Brown.
Looking for what tilted California from red to blue, many see that passage of Proposition 187 – and particularly Republican Pete Wilson’s strong embrace of it – as a major inflection point.
Pete Wilson won the battle in 1994, securing his re-election. But the California GOP would lose the war as the party sank into an irrelevancy which continues today.
Proposition 187 – which would wind up being struck down later anyway -angered and motivated California’s burgeoning Latino population, which would shoot up from less than 3 million in 1970 to 14 million in 2010 – becoming a dominant demographic group in the state in 2014, according to US Census Data.
Anger among California Latinos over Prop 187 prompted a surge in voter registration for a number of years, and many Latino voters found a home with the Democratic Party.
California Republican voter registration has been in a slow decline since 2004.
The cautionary value of the California experience should be clear.
As in California, the population of the United States as a whole is growing and becoming more diverse. The United States is set to become a white minority in 2045, according to the US Census.
Any political gain that Donald Trump and the Republicans might see from obsessing over border walls, demonizing immigration and the use of divisive xenophobic rhetoric will be short term, at best.
Long term, Trump and his party will suffer the same debilitating taint experienced by the California GOP.

627,Klobuchar: Will ‘Minnesota Nice’ Win in 2020?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/klobuchar-will-minnesota-nice-win-in-2020/,"In the midst of a snow squall back home in Minnesota over the weekend, Sen. Amy Klobuchar became the fifth US senator and the fifth woman to declare a candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
She chose to cast herself as a folksy midwesterner.
“That sense of community is fracturing across our nation right now, worn down by the petty and vicious nature of our politics. We are all tired of the shutdowns and the showdowns, the gridlock and the grandstanding,” Klobuchar said. “Our nation must be governed not from chaos but from opportunity. Not by wallowing over what’s wrong, but by marching inexorably toward what’s right. And it has to start with all of us.”
Amidst so much which is grim and negative in society today, Minnesota’s senior senator certainly is offering the nation a more positive vision.
However, while she is highlighting a certain folksy “can-do” attitude, Klobuchar has declined to embrace such progressive initiatives that other Democratic candidates are touting as Medicare-for-all universal health coverage and the abolishment of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). She’s also not publicly endorsed a $15 an hour minimum wage.
Klobuchar has a certain level of appeal as a candidate, given that she has won her three Senate races by convincing margins.
But even some of Klobuchar’s friends and allies in Minnesota openly worry her more centrist approach might not provide a strong enough contrast when held up to what would be, ultimately, a loud, ugly contest with Donald Trump.
“Her voting record is safe. It’s very centrist and that’s just not what we’re about,” says Anita Seeling, vice chair of the board of Our revolution Minnesota, a state branch of an organization built from Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign. “We need someone that’s a champion.”
None of this is to make any firm determination on Klobuchar’s candidacy at this early stage. The primary season is still about a year away.
As Minnesota political activist told a reporter, “I think that any sensible person is going to take a look at every single candidate. Let’s talk about every candidate’s strengths and weaknesses.”
Then there is a second part to this story which may, or may not, haunt Klobuchar in her campaign. On the sidelines of her snowy presidential campaign lift-off, the newly minted candidate was forced to acknowledge, “Yes, I can be tough and, yes, I can push people.”
She was responding to a HuffPost report which essentially describes Klobuchar creating such a demanding and hostile work environment as a senator that, at one point, then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid had to step in and admonish her.
At this point, of course, this entire matter could dissolve if an overall feeling that it’s been handled appropriately takes hold. On the other hand, if more stories of the senator berating or abusing her staff continue to leak out, she could lose goodwill and support very quickly, and see the end to her road to the White House just as fast.

628,"Can Anyone Become President Nowadays? Well, Here’s Anyone Who Has!",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/can-anyone-become-president-nowadays-well-heres-anyone-who-has/,"It was some years ago that Shawn Hubler, an L.A. Times columnist, stated unequivocally that ANYONE in modern America could become President today.
And “anyone” has. Donald Trump is only the LATEST example–granted, he’s by no means your everyday Joe but as a non-politician, non-lawyer (27 of the 44 proxies have been attorneys), a person who had never before held a public office (neither George Washington nor Dwight Eisenhower did), and a womanizer, he represents a whole lot of “anyone.”
Arguably, having BEEN a lawyer, politician, office holder and faithful husband are good attributes to have in a president. But NOT having them clearly doesn’t disqualify a future presidential candidate, nor does it necessarily greatly affect an elected president’s ultimate legacy.
As one pundit pointed out recently, Donald Trump never really planned to run for president–much less win. Had he, he most likely would never have had to (try to) silence Stormy Daniels. But even now he likely won’t pay politically for his imbroglio.
Wealth, privilege and celebrity obviously help in getting many into the White House–which average Joes generally don’t have as do just anyone. Ronald Reagan and Teddy Roosevelt had them and not incidentally they ultimately had very successful presidencies. Trump, of course, has them but the verdict is still out on how “successful” he will be.
Nothing really disqualifies being a viable presidential candidate unless you are a woman (so far), black (at least until Barack Obama), an atheist, a felon, or someone who’s been in cahoots with a foreign dictator. (We’ll see about the latter, later). White male Protestants who’ve avoided run-ins with the law and served in the military are especially welcome to “apply.”
Once elected, really good (especially great) presidents have the following eight “common leadership qualities” according to historian Jerry Barber:
1. a strong vision for the country’s future
2. an ability to put their own times in the perspective of history
3. effective communication skills
4. the courage to make unpopular decisions
5. crisis management skills
6. character and integrity
7. wise appointments
8. an ability to work with Congress
By these standards/criteria Donald Trump, after halfway through a term, is somewhat lacking (others might argue seriously lacking). Interestingly, his detractors have been both conservative and liberal.
Does Trump have some of the above presidential qualities?
Well, his “vision for the future” (#1)– which is to Make America Great Again (MAGA)–assumes America has lost its greatness, a premise that many feels is ludicrous. America is STILL great militarily, culturally, economically and educationally–no question. The country remains a shining democracy in a world of totalitarianism and religious extremism. That America is losing influence on the global stage to China, and cachet to even much smaller countries like Australia and Canada, IS concerning. But most would agree that America remains ascendant in many areas.
Other categories where Trump’s leadership qualities and skills have come into question are (3), (6), (7) and (8). These bullet points have seriously undermined his presidency. Few admire his blusterous narcissism or his lack of cooperative statesmanship in the company of fellow dignitaries. After dozens of his appointments have gone south–with resignations by senior staff almost daily–he clearly lacks tolerance for others’ views and isn’t good at compromise. Several of his pre-presidential collaborators are facing jail time as felons, showing he lacks good judgment in selecting the company he keeps.
And as far as Trump being able to work with a divided Congress, having lost the House in the midterms will surely make it much more difficult for him to get anything accomplished in the next couple of years.
#4 is a bit of a conundrum. Trump made a decision to put up a large Wall on the border because many Americans felt that illegal immigrants were taking jobs from citizens. But at the same time illegal immigration flows from Mexico were abating–partly because NAFTA was encouraging Mexican employers to hire in their “maquiladoras” (plants along or near the border that supply parts/materials to states-based companies).
Somehow Trump erroneously concluded that keeping Mexicans gainfully employed south of the border was not enough of a disincentive for them to trek northward–and also that such employment threatens the U.S.’s own manufacturing operations. Even many Americans who are in favor of The Wall recognize that it will hardly keep people out who are determined to flee northward. (It is Hondurans and El Salvadorians who really want in, not Mexicans).
And probably NO ONE wants a $5 billion dollar (or more) price tag for an inconsequential wall…
It may seem to some too early to weigh in on whether Trump has been a good president so far. But in February 2018 the American Political Science Association’s Presidents and Executive Politics section, which has developed rating criteria for all 44 Presidents, published its findings. The Association has Republicans, Democrats and Independents among its scholar members so cannot be considered partisan.  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/19/opinion/how-does-trump-stack-up-against-the-best-and-worst-presidents.html
In the study, presidents are rated on a 1-100 scale (100 being the highest level of “greatness”) Over time the numbers do change and presidents move up or down on the list based on how history treats them. For example, Franklin Roosevelt is now considered our third greatest president. (Roosevelt’s rule!) Republican presidents Reagan and Eisenhower are top ten winners.
Until President Trump came along, James Buchanan was scraping the “bottom of the barrel” at Number 44. Buchanan is now Number 43. President Trump languishes at #44 with only 12 points out of 100.
Such a determination is rather stunning at this juncture and surely the numbers WILL change. One might conjecture about how they could change in Trump’s favor before 2021.
Here are some ideas: The Donald could actually get Kim Jong Un to destroy his nukes; he could stabilize his cabinet by being less impulsive; he could find a way to forestall an impending downturn (a challenge to his successes in cutting corporate taxes); he could pay down the national debt; and he could suddenly have a few good things to say about immigrants–who can be credited for (at least early in our history) making America great..
But don’t hold your breath that ANY of these rather desirable things will ever happen.

629,The problem with US education isn’t the money.,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-problem-with-us-education-isnt-the-money/,"The United States has the world’s largest economy and spends the most money on education.  Yet, the U.S. still lags behind countries such as the United Kingdom, Finland, Norway, and Japan.  Many lawmakers have blamed this on public schools not having enough money.  Other’s blame it on the quality of the education.  However, it’s more of an issue of how schools spend their money.
For example, an audit on public schools in Fort Worth, Texas, showed that schools spent over 2.5 million dollars on technology – that was never used.
Fruitless spending has never been an option, especially when the budget is limited. There is a saying that goes, “Quality, not Quantity.” Instead of adding more to the budget, schools need to be more careful about what they spend their money on.
Another example would be a school’s spending on software.  Many schools subscribe to a variety of web tool, most without many purposes.  These tools Grammarly Premium, a grammar checking service that costs ~ $9.99/month/user, Hapara, a student web monitoring extension that allows teachers to spy on what students are doing, which costs ~$10/user.  These costs quickly add up because of the number of students at each school.  Many schools also end up spending money on anti-drugs/alcohol videos/lessons.
However, this also reflects on the type of students we have.  After all, if everyone was hard-working and had no knowledge of drugs, why would we need student monitoring services in the first place?  I’m not saying that we shouldn’t educate students on this topic.  I’m simply saying that districts should have a better program to streamline a student’s education.  Instead of finding tens of Chrome extensions that overlap in functionality and require a subscription, why not just hire a developer once and pay only once?
More than that, we should have better standards.  Yes, we have Common Core.  But that is education standards, or what teachers need to teach.  We should also have better classroom quality standards.  Standards like how a teacher should teach.  For example, they should offer help to students who need it.  They should always have a good attitude.  Many teachers teach solely based on the textbook.  They will simply read the textbook and ask students to do the problems.  But most of the time, that’s not a good way to teach.  The Washington Post says, “Research shows that with rare exceptions they [textbooks] do not help improve student achievement much. They are not effective because effectiveness doesn’t sell.”  Instead, teachers should actually take the time to design a lesson plan that they actually think will work, and change it based on feedback.  If they are unwilling or too lazy to do that, they shouldn’t be teachers.
Experienced teachers are usually better teachers.  There should be a program that allows new teachers and receive lessons from experienced teachers and learn what work and what doesn’t.  
It’s not a matter of more money.  It’s more of a matter of how to spend the money.  Increasing the budget and hoping that the education system will magically improve is like cutting off the leaves of a tree and hoping to kill it; we need to focus on the problem and solve it directly.
This article was written by Ricardo Henderaz, a ninth-grade student responding to why they think the US education system is failing.

630,What should be done about Ralph Northam’s yearbook photo?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/what-should-be-done-about-ralph-northams-yearbook-photo/,"The Facts
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam recently had an image of him released from his 1984 medical school yearbook, showing him in a racist outfit. The picture depicted two people, one dressed up as blackface, the other in a KKK outfit. (See above). At first, the governor admitted it was him in the yearbook and issued an apology. However, he then said that after he discussed thing with his past classmates, he thinks it’s not actually him in the picture.Many people, including his own party, the Democrats, urged him to resign. Virginia Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner and Virginia Representative Bobby Scott said, “Governor Northam has served the people of the Commonwealth faithfully for many years, but the events of the past 24 hours have inflicted immense pain and irrevocably broken the trust Virginians must have in their leaders. He should step down and allow the Commonwealth to begin healing.”Despite this statements, Northam resisted the call to resign and stated, “My fellow Virginians, earlier today I released a statement apologizing for behavior in my past that falls far short of the standard you set for me when you elected me to be your governor. I believe you deserve to hear directly from me.”

The Democrat
Featuring: Tony Panaccio, Chief Media Strategist and Vice-President of Communications of Bold Blue Campaigns
As a campaign crisis communications issue, this whole thing could have been handled far better than it was.
Northam HAD to know he had that pic in his yearbook. He was running for governor at one point, and I am sure someone on his staff had the talk with him about skeletons in the closet. At that point, Northam either chose not to disclose that to his team, or he did, and his team decided that playing ostrich was preferable to getting out in front of it.
Either way, they were incredibly naive to think something like that would never come out. Had I been with the campaign, I would have used that photo as the platform for a town hall meeting about racism. One of the biggest challenges in this country is the threat of casual racism. If you’ve ever seen someone say I’m not a racist, but — then you know what I mean by that term. It’s Tom Brokaw doing his grumpy old man act telling Hispanics they need to do a better job of assimilation. It’s the mid-westerners who say I’m not anti-immigrant. I just want people to speak English if they live in America. These people DO NOT recognize that these statements are racist, because their moms and dads used the N-word daily, so by an order of magnitude, these people think they are mainstream by comparison.
And there’s the rub. They’re not wrong. These views are far more mainstream than they deserve to be, which is why that high school yearbook photo could have been used positively by Candidate Northam to talk about how easy it is to fall down that rabbit hole.
This was me in high school, comfortable enough in my privilege and my naivety to think that this was funny. What’s worse is that the teacher who was the yearbook adviser thought the same. But it was wrong then, and it’s even more wrong now. I knew nothing. I had no context. A teenager’s world back then was very small, as compared to today’s teens, who are connected to the world through technology in ways we never could have dreamed. I was not an enlightened boy, but I am an enlightened man, and I wanted to show you these photos to make a point — racism doesn’t just live in the world of extremists who burn crosses, but it also lives and breathes in our communities and in our heartland in far more surreptitious ways, in between the lines of conversations. Certainly, we must repudiate people who dress in white hooded robes and sling Nazi slogans, but we must also reject it in these smaller forms, as well, whether it’s in casual conversation or in an old high school yearbook photo. We must do better than this because America is better than this.
Instead of resigning, which is what the party will force him to do, he could have championed a whole new movement to erase racism from our hearts and minds. It was a missed opportunity, and he deserves to go not just because of the racist optics, but because he was stupid. And stupidity has to have consequences.
The Republican

The past is the past. We shouldn’t make as big of a deal as the media are making now. Everyone has done stupid things in the past. People change a lot in a few decades. We shouldn’t be criticizing a politician for every little mistake they made. I bet if we dug up every single governor/senator/rep’s past, we would find many more similar circumstances. More importantly are a governor’s current views and actions. With the big deal the media is making about the image, you would think its life-changing. However, who hasn’t told a racist joke once?Northam shouldn’t resign. The important thing is to learn from one’s mistakes. We could dig up every bad thing that Hilliary Clinton did, or everything that Trump did. What would be the point? To prove that they make mistakes? To prove that they’re human? This is a fatal flaw with the Democrat party. They will stress over any tiny mistake that might hurt their “liberal” status. Equal rights and anti-racism are great, and I fully support the movements. However, there isn’t a single person that hasn’t done something that was racist or sexist. Trust me.

I think it is newsworthy to show two young men in Halloween garb over 30 years ago??? And to make this guy a racist for dressing like a Black Man/KKK for a costume party?? Maybe it would be fun to go back over 30 years to seen how all the black entertainers and politicians that have shown such contempt for themselves and their own race as to surgically alter their own looks to appear more like the White ideal??
I would think that Michael Jackson almost removing his nose to appear more white as have a number of high profile Black Ladies, should be
more disturbing than an college punk smearing shoe polish on his face??
And what about the long list of half White/Black politicians and entertainers claiming to be Black?? Remember when light skinned Black people sadly would pass for White??
I find him to be so over the top in his baby killing views as to expose just how satanically far the Democrats have fallen and how
cowardly are the Republicans who will not stand up against at least late term abortions.
In my view, black americans should be more concerned about abortionists killing almost one half million black babies a year than either a few rouge cops or black face Halloween outfits.
We cover up illegal invader crimes, sex slave trafficking, drug importing, etc. because of hating Trump, while making cover story news of a costume photo from 1984 that some black folks might find offensive.
Yes, we have lost our minds, morals and more.
Since I could care less about some Baby Killing Democrat in a state packed with government dependent clowns, my view has just become more clear – the guy is a two faced Democrat on steroids. Keep in mind that baby killing of defectives was the gate way to Nazi extermination of Jews, Jehovah Witnesses, gays, political enemies, etc.
Women being insensitive to killing their own children is more disturbing to me than a politician not seeing the insensitivity of black face.

Here’s a meme referencing to the record-breaking shutdown that ended during January. The shutdown ended with a temporary deal that provided no funding for the wall and extended current funding for 3 more weeks.
A classic Patrick meme about socialism.

“What Trump supporters be like.” – This meme describes Trump’s boasting about his usually superficial accomplishments.

“Trump Logic” – This meme refers to the FBI Hilliary Investigation during the 2016 election.  Many Democrats blame the investigation for Hilliary’s loss.  With the ongoing Robert-Mueller investigation, this meme characterizes Trump’s expected opinion.
FOX News: Breaking Headlines! – This meme shows Fox News’s unwillingness to cover anything that reflects poorly on Trump.
That’s a big oof. – Just another one of Trump’s 50,000 + tweets.

633,"Trump on Global ‘Waming’: ‘Please come back fast, we need you!’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-on-global-waming-please-come-back-fast-we-need-you/,"Amid the below freezing temperatures in the Midwest, President Trump took to Twitter to express his feelings.
In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can’t last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast, we need you!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2019

He claimed that ‘we need’ global warming to counter the freezing temperatures. Trump was met with people blasting him about his differentiation between climate and weather.
According to NASA, climate is, ‘the description of the long-term pattern of weather in a particular area,’ while weather, ‘is basically the way the atmosphere is behaving, mainly with respect to its effects upon life and human activities.’ Basically, climate is the average weather, while weather is just the current state of our surroundings. One is on a shorter scale and the other one is on a broader one.
Trump used the term, “global warming” in reference to climate change, implying that we can’t be having climate change since the weather is cold. However, the National Geographic says that “Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts. All of those changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, changing the rhythms of climate that all living things have come to rely on.” This means that climate change is not only the cause of global warming but also the extreme weather conditions that we are currently experiencing.
Furthermore, many people pointed out Trump’s incorrect spelling of warming as ‘waming.’
Twitter users replied with a variety of comments.

634,Trump Tweets New Wall Slogan, Gets Flamed on by Twitter,The BiPartisan Press,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-tweets-new-wall-slogan-gets-flamed-on-by-twitter/,"On Wednesday, January 23rd, the 33rd day of the world’s longest shutdown, Trump took to Twitter to announce his new “unofficial” wall slogan.  He tweeted, “BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL! This is the new theme, for two years until the Wall is finished (under construction now), of the Republican Party. Use it and pray!”

635,Why the “media” hates Donald Trump,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/why-the-media-hates-donald-trump/,"The Facts
Featuring: Mike Gnitecki, Healthcare Professional
Like him or hate him, President Trump consistently pushes the envelope. He seems to enjoy being controversial, and he definitely likes the spotlight.
President Trump has not really done anything widely divergent from what other Republican presidents have done. But the manner in which he does it is quite controversial. He is bold, brash, and also unpredictable. These are not necessarily negative attributes, but they differ from the actions of past U.S. presidents.
The media never loved Trump. Prior to his campaign, they seemed to like covering him when convenient — when it would boost their ratings. During
his campaign, they covered him extensively because he got them high viewership. Then-candidate Trump would call into television shows regularly and voice his opinion on topics, and viewers definitely watched these segments. He made himself highly accessible, and he would often make controversial statements. If sex sells, controversy sells more.
The media was largely unhappy with Trump becoming president. Rather than simply covering him for ratings, they now were forced to cover him because of him being the President. Trump also did not follow the practices of prior administrations, such as by him skipping the White House Correspondents’ Dinner for two years in a row now. His actions with foreign countries such as North Korea have been unpredictable (but arguably successful). He also espouses a dislike of the media and the fake news as he calls much of the media.
The Democrat
Featuring: Booth Fraser
The media doesn’t feel negatively about President Trump. And that’s because there is no “the media.:
That phrase is held up by Trump supporters, and the President himself, to denounce any stories they don’t want to hear or don’t agree with. It puts legitimate news organizations such as the Associated Press, which goes through a VIGOROUS vetting process prior to print, in the same category as Johnny the Lefty who runs a blog from his basement.
What needs to be understood is the difference between hard editorial and opinion. One reports the facts and one conveys thoughts. Are some opinion contributors focused on conveying the facts of any given issue? Absolutely.
But more often than not, it’s either about swaying public opinion or raising a personal profile. That’s a slippery slope given the laziness so many have in looking deeper into what they see and read. Alternative facts are the result.
Real news outlets and journalists do everything they can to get it right.
Their legitimacy and jobs depend on it. It’s similar to scientists who are much less concerned with the outcome than they are with the scientific process used to reach that outcome. That’s how they get to the truth.
Donald Trump has broken all the rules we’ve previously known and come to expect from a President. Merely reporting on what he does and says is enough to paint a negative picture. But as long as Americans turn away from
CONSIDERING THE SOURCE of the news and stories they consume, the door will be open to blaming the media for what some feel is negative reporting.
The Republican
Featuring: John Wilder, “Make America Great Again”
The media have been all-powerful in the past and when they want to destroy someone they have been very effective at doing it. Trump seems like The Teflon Don impervious to media attacks and in fact, he has gotten stronger with his base because of it. His giant ego and supreme self-confidence appeals to his base and is despised by the media. Trump Derangement Syndrome is the real deal and now the media and the Dems are doubling down.
Another reason is that he makes Obama look weak and ineffective which is blasphemy to many in the country and definitely with the media. Here is an example: Obama scoffed at Trump saying that he was going to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US. Obama practically spits on him with his deeply scoffing tone saying: what is he going to do, wave a magic wand and bring them back and then he did making Obama look completely incompetent which he definitely is.
It simply took a tax break in the corporate income tax rate which was the highest on our planet. He showed up Clinton’s NAFTA deal which was bad for our country and Trump made better deals. Trump made European allies finally pay for their military protection that they were legally required to do but Trump actually enforced it for the first time in history.
All previous presidents failed at reigning in North Korea and through his personality, he got the little tin-horn dictator to start denuclearization.
But the most important is that Trump keeps calling out the media on their sins and their short-comings and his base absolutely loves it. They have gone on full attack mode 24/7 and still, he survives. It is sort of like our fort in Saint Augustine when they were under attack. The fort was made from indigenous coquina rock which is soft. Every time they shot a cannon at it, the cannonball disappeared into the coquina rock and after a 24-hour bombardment, the captains abandoned their attack claiming that the cannonballs actually appeared to strengthen the walls. Unfortunately, the press is not going to come to their senses any time soon.

636,The Shutdown and The Wall: Who will get what they want?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-shutdown-and-the-wall-who-will-get-what-they-want/,"The Facts
12 days ago, an immigration spending bill was rejected, throwing the government into a partial shutdown.
A countless number of government services, like the National Park Service, were shutdown. The shutdown is the third of its kind this term, and this time, it was an argument over border protection.
President Donald Trump has long stated that America needs a wall. During his campaign, he promised to build one between the United States and Mexico to keep illegal immigrants out. However, the Democrats are in full opposition. The current plan allocates 5 billion dollars to build Trump’s wall. Democrats, on the other hand, want no funding for the wall, and instead, more money to be put on “general border security”
This Wednesday, the Republicans and Democrats are expected to hold a meeting with Donald Trump to dicuss funding. The House also plans to release a spending bill, although it unlikely to get approved by the president.
The Democrat
Featuring: William Seavey, from Crisis Response Publishing
The shutdown could have been avoided and the issue it is all about is totally misguided.
Our president, being the obstinate and cantankerous person that he is–unwilling to compromise about border security ever since he first proposed his so-called (and unnecessary) Wall–whose components keep changing–refuses to entertain the possibility that it makes little sense. A Wall won’t stop those seriously determined to enter the U.S. And they are the ones we should most be concerned about–terrorists, drug dealers, and yes, rapists and murderers. The others just want to work here and avoid poverty and starvation (mostly Central Americans).
The bad eggs will burrow under any Wall, fence etc., fly over it, and hide clandestinely in vehicles that penetrate it (at borders). Beef up security electronically and put up more Wall if necessary, but an impermeable border is a fool’s dream. I vote democratic but am generally conservative in many of my values. This is a big, unnecessary expense and is hurting millions who depend on the government to stay open.
The WSJ and some conservatives think the demos should broker an extension of the Dream Act for SOME wall to be built, but right now Democrats are firm that NO funds should be spent on the proposed Wall but are willing to spend up to $2 billion on “border security.” If only Trump would realize that an impermeable border is impossible and go with a partial iron slat fence, and electronic surveillance.
The Wall sends entirely the wrong message to an ally. Did you know that Wisconsin governor Scott Walker suggested a wall might need to go up between the U.S. and Canada? And this was before trade relations with the Canucks really soured when Trump proposed his new Nafta and criticized Canada for its “huge” trade imbalance.
The Republican
Featuring: John Wilder, Marriage and Relations Coach
I am a Republican and I fully support President Trump shutting the government down.
We need a wall.
A lot of countries have walls for their protection. Israel has a wall for their protection and they are one of our stanchest allies. I am sick to death of the liberals registering illegal immigrants to vote based upon the driver’s license that they give to them.
It is called motor voter registration. They are shattering the Constitution which says that only American citizens can vote in our elections. This is especially true in sanctuary cities, not to mention, all the American citizens illegals end up killing, raping etc.
The liberals were all on record supporting a wall and border security before Trump was elected and now they claim that it is immoral. Have any of the press asked them in what way is a wall immoral? The press always accepts what liberals say without question at face value and challenge everything Trump says or conservative say. The liberals have been on record supporting hate speech legislation.
Trump will not cave like other conservative presidents and will ultimately get his wall. This is why we elected him to be the disturber in chief. Most of the Republicans in office act like the school nerds with the Libtard bullies beat them and steal their lunch money. Trump made it okay for them to finally find their backbone and it started when the liberals tried to derail Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
We need protection. In my opinion Trump is not being aggressive enough. He is continuing to allow sanctuary cities to flout the law and our constitution. They continue to register illegals to vote through the motor voter app.
He also needs to remove the secrets status from the emails and establish his own special counsel to go after the crooked FBI agents, the former head of the IRS and prosecute her and above all else prosecute the Clintons. They have gotten away with flouting the law for too long. On the other hand, he has gotten a lot done with no cooperation from anyone. He has endured 99% hate speech 24/7.
Finally, the conservatives need to take a play from the Democratic playbook and rally around the troops and all sing the same song. Help them pass their hate speech legislation and then hold them accountable to it because they are the most egregious offenders of that “black art”

The Independent
Featuring: David Reischer, Attorney & CEO of LegalAdvice.com
The recent government shutdown in Washington demonstrates a truly broken and dysfunctional political system in America right now. As a registered member of the ‘Independent Party’ it is disheartening to see both the ‘Republican Party’ and the ‘Democrat Party’ unable to compromise.This most recent government shutdown over the funding for 5 billion dollars for a border wall on the southern border is just the latest of a long series of recent government shut downs that demonstrate that Washington is completely incapable of looking out for the best interests of the American people. It is oftentimes suggested by the pundits on television that the American people like gridlock in Washington because the American people prefer limited government in which Washington does not overstep its Constitutional authority.
I disagree with this premise, and think the American people, myself included, are completely sickened by the constant bickering and gamesmanship in this extremely polarized environment in America. It should be unnecessary to shutdown the government in order for both parties to reach a compromise.
A bipartisan solution for ‘comprehensive immigration reform’ in America will require both parties to work together.Comprehensive immigration reform, in the U.S. requires increased border enforcement with legalization for unauthorized immigrants and the ability to bring in future workers needed by the U.S. labor market. Any solution to these outstanding problems must be bipartisan and politicians that are seen as not serious about working across the aisle will be punished by the voter.
The American people are no longer fooled by the never ending finger pointing by both parties and endless kabuki theater in Washington. We need real leaders that can find compromise with the opposing political party and fix this broken immigration problem for the benefit of all the American people.
The Liberterian
Featuring: Pablo Solomon, Award winning designer
That is just is just symptomatic of how dysfunctional our system has become. The self-serving, vote buying politicians have lost all sense of honor, duty and dedication to serve the best interests of the American people.
The shutdown is fueled by a Trump hating, hysteric media that is sold on a borderless, Global, Leftist world.
The shutdown is necessary, but only because the Democrats hate Trump so deeply that they refuse to overhaul our insane immigration laws. They and the media seem oblivious to the obvious fact that among these illegal invaders are criminals and others who will cause havoc in the US.
We have more dangerous Latin gang members in the US than ISIS has members worldwide. Latin Americans are taught from childhood to hate America. Their corrupt, inept governments perpetuate the myth that all of the troubles in Latin America are due to the Yankee Imperialists. And our Leftist leaning media backs them up while ignoring the horrors and failures of socialism in Cuba and Venezuela.
A noticeable portion of immigrants hate America, hate Whites, hate capitalism, hate Christianity, etc. and are here at best to make money to send home and a worst to do us harm. A big chunk of immigrants see Americans as lazy, stupid, weak, undeservedly rich and just waiting to be played for suckers.
In addition, both Islamic and Leftist terrorists have been trained by Cuba and Venezuela and armed by the Soviets. ( research Isle of Pines training centers ) The anti-Trump Republicans want the cheap immigrant labor and the Democrats want their Leftist votes. No one seems to care about the harm that not carefully choosing who comes into our country brings.
What party does it benefit? Frankly, both parties are despised. The only common ground the Democrats have is their hatred of Trump. The only common ground the Republican voters have is their hatred of the media. Nearly everyone with whom I speak would prefer a viable 3rd choice. I am basically a Libertarian who wants individual freedom, individual responsibility and the least amount of government as possible. I believe in honest capitalism.
Both parties and the media are so removed from the American Heartland that they do not understand the majority of Americans do not want these invaders from the South.They do want border security. They could care less about a bunch of government workers who are perceived as lazy do nothings. who basically attend work, live for retirement. get automatic raises and who will eventually get their money.
By the way—our tax dollars are apparently being wasted on the silly Feed the Pig ads. Why have not government workers been saving for the next shutdown a.k.a. paid vacation.Half of Americans despise the media and see them as Leftist propagandists.
The outcome will be kicking the can down the road as usual.
We are all asking the questions — Why is it that these illegal invaders get housing, money, medical care, etc. while we have homeless people walking our streets and our own children being neglected?
Why is it that our welfare people are so stupid/lazy you cannot teach them to make a hotel room bed, wash a dish, tie rebar or pick at tomato??
Why have we had so many shutdowns this term?
Because the media is in perfect tune with the Trump hating Democrats and back stabbing Rhinos to do anything and everything possible to destroy Trump. No one cares about what is really good for America. Everyone knows our immigration laws are insane and we are being invaded by people we do not need and will be a drain on our resources.
Immigration should be merit-based. The concept of an asylum seeker is being abused and exploited.
But since the goal is to destroy Trump, who cares about what is good or bad for America??

637,Republican Senator Breaks With Trump on Hydroxychloroquine: I’m Not a Doctor,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/republican-senator-breaks-with-trump-on-hydroxychloroquine-im-not-a-doctor/,"While Donald Trump has continued to tell Americans that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine should be a recognized medication against COVID-19, one of his Republican allies said such decision making should be left to trained medical professionals.
Despite Trump’s enthusiasm, medical professionals, including federal coronavirus task force member Dr Anthony Fauci, has been more circumspect about its use given the lack of scientific evidence that it’s safe and effective against COVID-19.
There have been more than 1.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 83,000.
In the United States, there have been 427,460 cases reported, including 14,696 deaths, according to the most recent data released from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Some individuals, including Hollywood actor Daniel Dae Kim, swear by the benefits of hydroxychloroquine, after being cured of COVID-19 after taking it. But such experiences are entirely anecdotal at this point.
“I’m talking to the [Food and Drug Administration] FDA all the time and I’m supportive of doing all we can to waive things that get in the way of doing the right thing here. I don’t know, in the case of this medicine, even though it’s been proven safe if you have malaria and don’t have other decisions, you want to be sure it’s safe for everybody. I don’t know that,” Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said in a radio interview. “I’m certainly in a position to tell the FDA administrator, I think they should do everything they reasonably can to have public safety and waive rules when they can be waived. But I’m — I’m not a doctor and I’m not going to become one on this call.”

638,Cuomo: New York State Dept. of Health Has Developed an Antibody Test,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/cuomo-new-york-state-dept-of-health-has-developed-an-antibody-test/,"Researchers at the New York State Department of Health have developed a new test which determines if an individual has been infected with–and recovered from–the COVID-19 illness, according to Gov Andrew Cuomo (D).
The health department is now working with the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make that test available at mass scale, he added.
There have been more than 1.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 82,000.
In the United States, there have been 374,329 cases reported, including 12,064 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
And most of those cases in the United States have occurred in the area in and around New York, which has been the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States.
“And that is an entirely new field that we are just developing now, right? New York state developed, a Department of Health to develop an antibody testing regimen that Department of Health has approved for use in New York state,” the governor said. “That has to be brought to scale, and the Department of Health is going to be working with the FDA to do just that. This test the blood to determine whether or not you have the antibodies which means you had the virus and resolved the virus. That’s why you would have the antibodies for the virus. That would mean that you are no longer contagious, and you can’t catch the virus because you have the antibodies in your system, which means you can get to work, you can go back to school, you can do whatever you want.
“But you have to have that testing, and you have to have that testing on a scale, right? You have 19 million people in the state of New York; just think of how many people you would need to be able to test and test quickly. So the antibody testing as part of that,” Cuomo added.
“Also, rapid testing to determine whether or not you have the virus now exists. They have ‘15 minute’ tests that are commercially available. But again, they have to be brought to scale,” the governor. “No private company has the capacity to bring those to scale. So I was speaking with Governor [Phil] Murphy [of New Jersey] and Governor [Ned] Lamont [of Connecticut], we are interested in working with private companies that can actually bring this testing capacity to scale quickly, because again if you have the antibody testing, that’s part, if you can then test if a person is positive for the virus and you can do it that day you can get those results in 15 minutes, that’s also another way to get back to life and do it quickly. So we are very interested in that, so is New Jersey, so is Connecticut. There are private companies that have these tests. Again, it’s all up to scale. We are starting them in the state of New York but we only have about a 50,000 person testing capacity, which is nice, but it is not a scale that’s actually going to make a large difference.
“So private companies that are interested in getting it to this base and coming up to scale quickly, we are interested in those companies and we are interested in investing in those companies and they should contact us at Empire State Development Corporation,” Cuomo said.

639,Dr Fauci Says Schools Can Likely Resume in the Fall,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/dr-fauci-says-schools-can-likely-resume-in-the-fall/,"Although he didn’t want to make any hard-and-fast promises, the leading US immunologist Dr Anthony Fauci said Tuesday that he believes schools will be able to resume in the United States in the fall.
Schools, along with much of everything else is shut down in most of the United States as part of the extreme measures to try to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic.
There have been more than 1.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 82,000.
In the United States, there have been 374,329 cases reported, including 12,064 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
“I fully expect, though I’m humble enough to know that I can’t accurately predict, that by the time we get to the fall, that we will have this under control enough that it certainly will not be the way it is now, where people are shutting schools,” said Dr Fauci, a member of the federal coronavirus task force and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “My optimistic side tells me that we will be able to renew, to a certain extent, but it will be different.
“Remember now, because this is not going to disappear, so we will have to have in place the capability of doing the things that we talk about all the time on this stage, to identify, to isolate, to contact trace, Number One. Number Two, by that time we will have a better feel with the antibody test about what the actual penetrance of this infection was in society,” he added. “How many people have actually been infected? Who is protected? If you have antibodies, it’s very likely that you’re protected. Who is vulnerable? Do you treat vulnerables different than you treat people who are protected?
“All of these things will go into the decision of just how much back to the original way we’d like it to be in the fall,” Dr Fauci said. “The bottom line is, no absolute prediction, but I think we will be in good shape.”

640,Meghan McCain: I’m Fearful ‘Totalitarian’ Trump Will Try Pandemic Power Grab,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/meghan-mccain-im-fearful-totalitarian-trump-will-try-pandemic-power-grab/,"A prominent conservative commentator on television has voiced her concerns that Donald Trump will use the coronavirus pandemic as a means for an authoritarian power grab.
Like the rest of the world, the United States is reeling from the effects of coronavirus, the mass deaths caused by the COVID-19 disease and the economic fallout from the extreme lockdown and social distancing measures most of the nation is under in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.
“So I think the point you’re making, Sunny, about the [Trump] press conferences, because there is an argument that’s being made by some people in media that the press conferences shouldn’t be being covered at all, and my argument for keeping the press conferences is I think we’re at a place where President Trump, he has always been a sort of totalitarian president in a way that we’ve never historically seen before. And my fear is that he’s going to play on the American public’s fears in a draconian way, and possibly do something akin to the Patriot Act going forward where he uses this moment in time to play off our fears for his own benefit,” Meghan McCain said in conversation on the daily TV talk show which she co-hosts. “And I think seeing front and center what him and his team — I for one, became even more fearful of what was happening when I saw how inept [Trump son-in-law and adviser] Jared Kushner was.
“So I think while he has a team of doctors like Dr. Fauci that we’re all in agreement is doing a great job, my fear is that is moment in time that can be manipulated by our powers, and by the government in place, and I want to see front and center what he’s saying, no matter how ridiculous some of the press conference commentary ebbs into,” McCain added.

641,Gov Cuomo on Ventilators: ‘The Federal Government Does Not Have a Stockpile That Can Serve the Nation’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/gov-cuomo-on-ventilators-the-federal-government-does-not-have-a-stockpile-that-can-serve-the-nation/,"Maintaining an adequate supply of ventilators to match the demand of the stream of hospitalized COVID-19 patients filling New York state beds has been a singular challenge during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, and the federal government has been an unreliable partner in helping meet demand, according to New York Gov Andrew Cuomo (D).
There have been more than 1.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 73,000.
In the United States, there have been 367,004 reported cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. There have been 10,871 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
Most of those US cases are centered in and around the New York area, which has been the epicenter of the pandemic.
“We had a projected model that we would need about 30,000 ventilators. You know, what governors do — well, I can’t speak for all governors. I work with many of them and many of them are my colleagues. What we do in New York is, we do this from data and from a science. You know, I’m not a medical professional. And I don’t have a crystal ball. So, use the data. Use the science. And follow the numbers. We have projection models, which, by the way, are basically on track with what we’re seeing,” Cuomo said. “And from those projection models, we’ve been trying to get supplies, which has been the great shortage all across this country and that’s going to be a story for another day. But, those are the models we’ve been following, how many beds, how many ventilators, etc.
“Ventilators wound up key in this specific situation. And I don’t think anyone anticipated it, and frankly, I don’t think anyone could. This virus happened to be a respiratory virus. Happened to be almost paralyzing of the lungs in the right circumstances. And you needed a ventilator to keep a person alive, and if you didn’t have a ventilator, you couldn’t be of any assistance to that person. So you had this mad scramble for ventilators nationwide. But everyone had to do what they could do to get the right number. And you were following a projection model. So we’ll see what we need at the end of the day. But there’s no reason for anyone to get defensive about this either,” Cuomo added. “I understand, the federal government does not have the stockpile that can serve the nation. That’s a fact. So let’s stop worrying about yesterday and start planning for tomorrow.”
The governor was asked that, if he requested 30,000 ventilators, how many does the state actually have, and is it enough?
“Right now, it is not enough. What we’re doing is, we have come up with very creative and elaborate plans. We’re moving ventilators around the state from hospital to hospital,” Cuomo replied. “There’s a new device that actually, what they call, splitting a ventilator, where one ventilator can operate two sets of tubes for two sets of patients. We’re using what’s called BiPap machines, which are not really ventilators, but they can help people who don’t really need a full ventilator and they assist breathing, rather than a full ventilator. So we’ve come up with all of these fallback adaptations to make do, you know? The old expression is, you don’t go into war with what you want, you go to war with what you have.
“So, yes, plan, and we try to get the right supplies. At the end of the day, you have what you have, and you have to make do. You can’t find a ventilator on this planet, at this point,” the governor added. “Every country is trying to get it. So we’ve come up with very creative ways to make do with the equipment we have.”

642,Navarro Feuds with Dr. Fauci: Is there any reason “to doubt the analysis of Dr. Anthony Fauci?”,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/healthcare/navarro-feuds-with-dr-fauci-is-there-any-reason-to-doubt-the-analysis-of-dr-anthony-fauci/,"On Saturday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro feuded with Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a Situation Room meeting regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine. Dr. Fauci argued that presently, there is no reliable evidence that proves hydroxychloroquine is effective in treating coronavirus, and much more data is needed. Navarro disagreed, stating that studies conducted of the antimalarial drug show it has “clear therapeutic efficacy.”

Today, Navarro was criticized by New Day’s co-anchor John Berman, who suggested he was not qualified to discuss COVID-19 treatment plans.
“You had a debate inside the Situation Room with the nation’s top infectious disease doctor, the man who is in charge to a certain extent of the nation’s medical response to this, and all he said, he wants this to work, everyone wants this to work. All he has said is, let’s let the testing and the science decide. What you seem to be saying is, I’ve read a study out of Wuhan, and I decided,” Berman told Navarro while interviewing him on the show.
Navarro disputed this claim, stating he actually “had over 100 pages of numerous studies” in the meeting, and “doctors disagree about things all of the time.”
Continuing, Navarro asserted that he has every right to discuss the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in treating coronavirus patients because he is a “social scientist.”

“I have a Ph.D., and I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it’s in medicine, the law, economics or whatever,” he added.
Following on from this, Berman asked if he had any reason “to doubt the analysis of Dr. Anthony Fauci?”
“I agree with the analysis of Dr. Fauci in this sense, it’s — we don’t have definitive 100 percent science to say that [hydroxychloroquine] absolutely works, and we don’t know what degree that is does work,” Navarro remarked. “That’s not inconsistent with the idea of using it as they do, in all 11 hospitals in the New York Health and Hospital System, as a therapeutic at this time when we are in basically at war with the virus, and it appears, at least in some studies, to have therapeutic efficacy.”
Trump has also been an advocate for the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. After the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency approval to distribute hydroxychloroquine to U.S. hospitals, Trump announced that he had stockpiled 29 million doses, and urged infected patients to take the drug if offered to them, saying “what do you have to lose?”

“We don’t have time to say, Gee, let’s take a couple of years and test it out, and let’s go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories. It doesn’t kill people,” Trump said.
The FDA explained that although the drug’s effectiveness is unproven, it is “reasonable to believe that…hydroxychloroquine sulfate may be effective in treating COVID-19.” They further noted that “the known and potential benefits of…hydroxychloroquine sulfate when used to treat COVID-19 outweigh the known and potential risks” of the drug.
Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician, warned that the antimalarial drug has the potential to cause “psychiatric symptoms, cardiac problems and a host of other bad side effects,” however, these side effects are rare.
During the interview, Berman addressed Trump’s recent comments, and asked if Navarro agreed with the view that patients had nothing to lose, even with the drug’s “potential side effects.”
“Well, look, you can take any drug right now in America and read the side effects and every single thing you take has some potential side effects that can harm you…but in this particular case, this drug has been around for many, many decades. It has recognized side effects, but some doctors judge that the risk is relatively low relative to the risk of dying of covid,” Navarro said.

Navarro then stressed that despite the disagreement between him and Dr. Fauci, the coronavirus task force members had all “unanimously” agreed to surge the hydroxychloroquine supply “to the hot zones and let the doctor-patient relationship determine who takes it.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have notably officially recognized hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment for coronavirus, but emphasize that currently there is no “available data from Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) to inform clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”

643,Bill Gates: ‘Things Won’t Go Back to Truly Normal Until We Have a Vaccine’,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/bill-gates-things-wont-go-back-to-truly-normal-until-we-have-a-vaccine/,"The United States, and the global community, won’t really return to normal until mass immunizations are available against the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Bill Gates, who with his wife, runs a charitable foundation which works against communicable disease.
Much of the United States, as well as most of the developed world, has been on extreme lockdowns and social distancing to try to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic.
This has kept many Americans out of restaurants, bars, theaters and many types of retail establishments–wherever crowds could gather.
There have been more than 1.2 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 69,000.
In the United States, there have been 338,999 cases reported, including 9,687 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
“It is fair to say things won’t go back to truly normal until we have a vaccine that we’ve gotten out to basically the entire world and so, the best people at the foundation were all about high-volume vaccines and are working with many manufacturers not only — but getting that billions of dose capacity,” said the former Microsoft chief. “And so like China, there will be a partial opening up, which some jobs will resume, school will resume, but will have to be very, very careful not to have the rebound until the vaccine comes.”
Public health professionals have said that it could be another year to 18 months before a safe and proven vaccine against COVID-19 could become available.

644,Gov. Cuomo Says NY Now Only 4 to 8 Days From COVID-19 Peak but ‘We’re Not Yet Ready’ for It,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/gov-cuomo-says-ny-now-only-4-to-8-days-from-covid-19-peak-but-were-not-yet-ready-for-it/,"The New York area, which has been dealing with most of the cases of COVID-19 in the United States, will likely reach the apex of the region’s pandemic within days–but the state’s still not ready, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).
There have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 58,000. 
In the United States, there have been 311,637 reported cases, including 8,454 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
The area around New York has become the epicenter for COVID-19 illness in the United States.
“We’re tracking the growth of the number of infections by hospital, and we can see just where the numbers are increasing. We’ve been talking about hitting the apex,” Cuomo said. “The apex is the point where the number of infections on a daily basis is at the high point that is the ultimate challenge I call it the battle of the mountaintop. That will be the Number One point of the engagement of the enemy.
“By the numbers we’re not at the apex. We’re getting closer, depending on whose model you’ll look at. They’ll say four, five, six seven days, some people go out 14 days but our reading of the projections is we’re somewhere in the seven-day range, four, five, six day range,” he added. “Nobody can give you a specific number, which makes it frustrating to plan when you don’t have a specific number or date, but we’re in that range. We’re not yet at the apex, but part of me says it’s good we’re not at the apex, because we’re not yet ready.”
The state’s been running short on needed medical equipment like ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gowns which medical professionals require.
Cuomo just signed an executive order designed to confiscate ventilators and PPE from hospitals where they are not used and deliver them to those where they are.

645,Mike Pence Embraces Socialized Medicine,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/mike-pence-embraces-socialized-medicine/,"After years of he and his boss complaining about “socialism,” Vice President Mike Pence is promising healthcare to all Americans–whether they have health coverage or not.
“And I will make sure that any American knows — even those with no insurance–will be able to receive treatment in the hospital and never have to worry about the bill,” Pence said, going on to thank the American people for their help getting through the coronavirus outbreak.
But stop and reread Pence’s healthcare promise to the American people.
It sounds much more like something that you would expect to come out of the mouth of a Democrat than a top member of the Trump administration.
To be sure: Pence is extending his generous offer as part of a response to a pandemic (and don’t doubt that this national emergency comes in the same year that he and Donald Trump will face an already dicey re-election campaign has something to do with it).
Let’s set those ulterior motives aside and take Pence’s guarantee for the generous offer it represents.
Yes, certainly, we are in the midst of the worst pandemic in decades.
But what, intrinsically, makes being stricken with COVID-19 somehow more morally worthy of a government guarantee of treatment than say, a 60-year-old hotel housekeeper who suddenly finds herself with advanced breast cancer, but her job doesn’t afford her any coverage?
Or, for that matter, young parents whose new little one is diagnosed with spina bifida but neither one can afford coverage with their jobs?
The real answer is none of the above is somehow more ethically or morally worthy of government support than the other.
If the federal government can guarantee treatment of COVID-19, it certainly can guarantee treatment of other maladies, as well.
And, certainly, on costs: if the federal government can guarantee treatment now–in the midst of federal budgeting thrown out the window so that the government can throw literally trillions of dollars at the US economy in an attempt to save it–the government could craft a coverage program which pays for treatment for all Americans at a point when federal policymakers can sit down and work out a rational plan.
Perhaps Republicans will have to give up anymore of their tax giveaways for the rich, but Mike Pence has already shown that he can embrace coverage for all.

646,Dr. Birx: We Believe There Is a Greater Proportion of People Who Are Asymptomatic,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/dr-birx-we-believe-there-is-a-greater-proportion-of-people-who-are-asymptomatic/,"The public health professionals tracking the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic believe that there is a sizeable population of asymptomatic people infected with the virus who are playing a role in spreading the pandemic, according to Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator.
There have been more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 53,000.
In the United States, there have been 245,442 reported cases of COVID-19, with 6,099 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
“And we all believe that there is a greater proportion of people who are asymptomatic, and that may correspond with age, with greater number of asymptomatic cases and people under 40,” Dr Birx said. “So both the severity of disease increases with age, but asymptomatic potential may also decrease with age, so it is more than the younger age group. So we believe that there could be significant transmission from asymptomatic individuals.”
Also, nations which strictly enforce their stay-at-home policies are more effective at flattening the curve, so to speak, or slowing down the spread of the virus, Dr Birx said.
“So we know from the countries around the globe that really enforced their stay-at-home policies have really flattened the curve. We see it happening in Italy, we see it happening in Spain, and we think that is incredibly important,” she said. “It’s why the president put out the guidelines, those are guidelines for all of Americans, speaking directly to Americans past their local governments and state governments to say, ‘Please, understand you need to stay home.'”

647,"Gov. Cuomo: If You Go on a Ventilator, There Is Roughly Only 20% Chance that You Will Come Off the Ventilator",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/gov-cuomo-if-you-go-on-a-ventilator-there-is-roughly-only-20-chance-that-you-will-come-off-the-ventilator/,"COVID-19 patients who have to go on a ventilator only have a 20 percent of ever coming off of it again, according to New York Gov Andrew Cuomo (D), who is leading the largest mobilization against the disease in the United States.
There have been more than 950,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 48,000.
In the United States, there have been 213,144 cases reported, including 4,513 deaths, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The New York area is currently the site of the largest number of COVID-19 cases in the nation.
Cuomo’s daily briefings have been broadcast nationally.
Cuomo also highlighted the regional cooperation in the states around New York, while mentioning those where case numbers are rising.
“Most impacted states: New York is at 83,000, New Jersey is at 18,000. Gov. Phil Murphy [of New Jersey], who has been a great partner to me, a great partner to the people of this state, Gov. Ned Lamont, also in Connecticut has been a great partner. We’ve done great work as a region, which is very unusual. You know those line between states often become walls. Not with Governor Murphy and that was Governor Lamont we are working together and we are going to work cooperatively with New Jersey because they have a real problem,” Cuomo said. “California is ticking up. Michigan is ticking up. Florida is even ticking up. Massachusetts — but no one is near anywhere we are, 83,000 compared to 18,000. Number of deaths, 1,900, up from 1,550. That number will continue to go up.
“That’s people continuing to be on ventilators for a period of time. If you go on a ventilator, there is roughly only had 20 percent chance that you will come off the ventilator. The longer you are on the ventilator, the lower the chance you come off. We are still looking for a curve. We are still looking to see where we hit the plateau. Total number of new hospitalized, again, you see the number goes up and down. But the overall trajectory of the number is up.”

648,"Dr. Fauci: We Hope, and I Believe It Will Happen, that We May Start Seeing a Turnaround",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/dr-fauci-we-hope-and-i-believe-it-will-happen-that-we-may-start-seeing-a-turnaround/,"Dr Anthony Fauci, the famed immunologist who is advising Donald Trump on the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic–and has increasingly become the public face in the crisis–is starting to offer Americans a glimmer of hope even as the deadly virus continues to spread.
There have been more than 855,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 42,000.
In the United States, there have been 190,022 cases of COVID-19, with 4,102 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
“If you look now, we’re starting to see glimmers that that is actually having some dampening effect. But that does not take away from the seriousness of what you just described on the show,” Dr Fauci said during an on-air TV interview. “We clearly are seeing cases going up. The people in New York are in a difficult situation, and what they’re trying to do appropriately is make the best of it by opening up facilities that might decompress the surge of cases that they’re having.
“And you described it very well, and that’s the reason why things like the Javits Center, getting the Comfort into the harbor, to be able to do that,” Dr Fauci added, referring to the huge US Navy hospital ship which has docked outside of New York City so as to add medical capacity in the area where the epicenter of the pandemic has been. “We’re still in a very difficult situation. We hope, and I believe it will happen, that we may start seeing a turnaround, but we haven’t seen it yet. We’re just pushing on the mitigation to hope that we do see that turnaround.”
Meanwhile, Dr Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that the nation would be much better prepared should there be a second wave of the pandemic.
“No, Jim, if we do have a second wave, which as I mentioned publicly I think there is a reasonably good chance we will, given the pervasiveness of this infection and its transmisibility, I don’t think at all it will be as bad because we’ll have several things in our favor,” he told the on-air host during his CNN interview. “One, we’ll obviously be better prepared. We’d have better equipment, we’d be able to deal with it better. But also we have a number of drugs that are in a clinical trial and we’re pushing hard on the vaccine. Remember, I said a year to a year-and-a-half, so by next winter we may be able to even utilize that. So I think I can say with some confidence that if we indeed get that second wave, we will be much, much better prepared than we are right now.”

649,Congresswoman Speculates: ‘Maybe We’re Never Going to Handshake Again’ After COVID-19,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/congresswoman-speculates-maybe-were-never-going-to-handshake-again-after-covid-19/,"Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich) is speculating that handshakes might no longer be acceptable after the coronavirus outbreak is over.
“You think about what our world was like two weeks ago. It was totally different, and the world’s been turned upside down,” Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said last week during a tele-conference with constituents.
“I don’t lie to people,” she continued. “I tell you what I’m thinking. We’re going to have to think differently about how we gather and maybe we’re never going to handshake again, maybe the bump becomes. Maybe we have to keep more space in between us but we will get through this. … We’ll do business maybe a tad differently but we’ll still be doing it.”
There have been more than 855,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 42,000.
In the United States, there have been 190,022 cases of COVID-19, with 4,102 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
After the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dingell said that “we’re going to need a massive infrastructure program when we get to the other side of this immediate healthcare.”
President Trump has also suggested that the public might not be able to shake hands in the future because of the coronavirus outbreak.
“Maybe people aren’t going to be shaking hands anymore,” he said.
Referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Trump added, “He was saying the regular flu would be cut down by quite a bit if we didn’t do that, if we didn’t shake hands.”

650,Gov. Cuomo: ‘New York Is Not an Anomaly’ for Coronavirus Infections,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/gov-cuomo-new-york-is-not-an-anomaly-for-coronavirus-infections/,"The state of New York currently has 59,648 coronavirus infections, and 965 deaths, surpassing the other states by a considerable margin. Speaking at a coronavirus press conference, the governor addressed the current situation for New York, saying “the number of cases continues to go up, 6,984, total number of cases 66,000 cases.”
More importantly, the governor warned that what was happening in New York was not an “anomaly” and other states may soon follow a similar curve of infection as New York.

“There’s only one county now that does not have a Covid case. Anyone who says this is a New York City only situation is in a state of denial. There is no American who is immune to this virus I don’t care if you live in Kansas, I don’t care if you live in Texas, there is no American that is immune. What is happening to New York is not an anomaly. There is nothing about a New Yorker’s immune system that is any different than any other American’s immune system.”
“So in many ways, New York is just a canary in the coal mine. What you see us going through here, you will see happening all across this country. So part of what we are doing here is not only serving New Yorkers, but we believe we’re dealing with this pandemic at a level intensity and density no one has seen before, and hopefully, we’ll learn lessons here that we can then share with people across this nation.”

As cases in other states start to increase exponentially, he warned that New Jersey and California could be next to see their health care system overwhelmed.
“Most impacted states, New York you see is at 66,000, New Jersey is next with 13, California 6,000. So we have ten times the problem that California is dealing with. 2,739 deaths in the state of New York.”

651,WHO Epidemiologist: ‘Too Early To Tell’ If Recovered Patients Are Immune From Getting Coronavirus Again,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/who-epidemiologist-too-early-to-tell-if-recovered-patients-are-immune-from-getting-coronavirus-again/,"It’s “too early to tell” whether those patients who have been sickened by the coronavirus and the COVID-19 disease and have recovered from them have developed an immunity from being re-infected by the illness, according to an epidemiologist from the World Health Organization (WHO).
There have been more than 740,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 35,000.
In the United States, 140,904 cases have been reported, including 2,405 deaths, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The worst of the cases are centered in the area in and around New York City.
“Well, at the World Health Organization we have been discussing with a group of people how best this outbreak can be stopped and at the same time how the lockdown procedures can be lifted,” said Dr David Heymann. “And the general consensus is, it depends on the risk assessment in the country. China has already begun to unlock its heavy industrial sector and also its small business sector and they are watching very closely to make sure that transmission doesn’t increase as a result.
“That’s what other countries need to do it is a well. They need to understand where the majority of transmission is occurring and then they need to keep those sectors locked down most while unlocking the sectors where transmission is less important and having measures in place to stop transmission should it begin to increase again,” the physician said.
In terms of long-term immunity for those who have been previously infected, Dr Heymann said, “You know, other coronavirus don’t develop long-term immunity, people can get viruses that cause the common cold on are a regular basis so it is very important that the immune response to this organism be studied, it is too early to say for sure, hopefully there will be an immunity that is developed so vaccines can be developed and a other means of prevention will be possible.”

652,Former Commissioner: NYPD Is ‘Losing Signifcant Numbers of Personnel’ to Coronavirus,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/former-commissioner-nypd-is-losing-signifcant-numbers-of-personnel-to-coronavirus/,"As New York City struggles with being the epicenter of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, so is its police department, with more than 700 of its officers having contracted the virus, according to former police commissioner Bill Bratton.
More than 736 New York City police officers have contracted the virus and almost 5,000 have been out sick, said Bratton, who served as New York City police commissioner from 1994 to 1996, and again from 2014 to 2016.
“The police commissioner estimates tomorrow morning when they do the morning report that number of sick officers may be as high as 500 with upwards of 15 percent of the uniform force out sick. Those are phenomenal numbers,” he said in an on-air TV interview.
“Well, speaking specifically for the NYPD, which is privileged to be commissioner twice of that department and other large agencies like the Los Angeles police chief, they’ve got extraordinary staff, dedicated personnel. So the planning capabilities are significant,” Bratton added. “They are looking at multiple ways of dealing with the loss of these officers in 10- to 12-hour shifts, bringing the detective force–7,000 officers–into uniform. There is a variety of staffing ways that this can be dealt with.
“The problem, however, outside of New York in large cities, 18,000 police departments in this country. The majority have 25 offices or less. So if you start losing 10, 15, 20, 25 percent of those forces, that starts getting towards like a catastrophe stage. One of the ways we can deal with this is the repetition of what all these governors have been asking for, a appropriate equipment to protect the first line, defenders, nurses, police and our firefighters. To that degree. The prioritization of getting adequate equipment will help.
“One good news statistic cited earlier on MSNBC was that about 80 percent of those afflicted with the virus that it is not life-threatening that to the extent that they have to go on the ventilators that they will recover and you will be starting to see in some instances officers coming back to work or being asked to come back to work,” Bratton said. “This is where the testing is to make sure if they are able to come back after having them. That they are, in fact, well enough to come back.”

653,"La. Congressman: Yes, Trump’s Actions Have Cost American Lives",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/la-congressman-yes-trumps-actions-have-cost-american-lives/,"The novel coronavirus outbreak continues to spread at an alarming rate in the state of Louisiana, with more than 3,500 confirmed cases and 151 deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state has the fastest growth of new cases in the world, with a growth trajectory similar to that in Italy and Spain.
With that the case, the lone Democrat in the Bayou State’s congressional delegation, Rep. Cedric Richmond, is directly blaming Donald Trump for needless COVID-19 deaths.
“Look, if you ask me do I think the president’s action versus cost us American lives? The answer is yes, unfortunately,” he said in a TV interview. “Let’s go back to, I believe it was January 22, when he did his first interview and I think it was on CNBC and they asked him, ‘Do you think we have the danger of a pandemic from coronavirus?’ He said, ‘No, no, no, not at all. We have this totally under control.’ Remember, January 22 was a month before Mardi gras. I mean, those are the types of this I think so that matter to the American people.
“You sound the alarm initially and I won’t dodge a question about Joe Biden. Joe Biden is not criticizing President Trump to the extent, in a campaign manner. What he’s doing is offering advice on what a president should do,” Richmond added. “One, show empathy, but, two, be very decisive, make the hard decisions…
“We should have sent our own team of doctors to China in the beginning to figure out what was going on, not trust the Chinese government to tell us the truth,” the congressman said. “Then we should have started preparing for coming over to American shores. And the [former] vice president has a lot of experience in it, because he dealt with ebola they protected our homeland and they prevented it from coming here. So, but, just to be technical, that ad is not coming from the campaign. I think it’s a third party group. The president right now is focused on trying to heal this country and offer advice and guidance to this president on how to beat this pandemic.
“Look, people know how I feel about President Trump. But right now, I am his biggest fan. I want him to win, because if he wins, that means we save lives,” Richmond said. “I’m just not that confident that he has it in him to do it. But I’m hoping for him. I’m praying for him. And I’m praying for the American people.”

654,L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti: We See in Traffic and Phone Data 99% of People Staying Home,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/l-a-mayor-eric-garcetti-we-see-in-traffic-and-phone-data-99-of-people-staying-home/,"An analysis of traffic patterns and mobile phone data use indicates that 99 percent of residents are staying home as requested to help slow the spread of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, according to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced a “shelter in place” order for the state March 19 telling residents that they had to remain indoors and avoid others, except for grocery shopping, medical appointments and performance of essential jobs.
There have been more than 690,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 32,000.
In the United States, there have been 125,308 reported cases of the disease, and 2,246 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
Although most of the reported coronavirus cases in the United States are now in New York, that’s expected to move west to California in a matter of weeks.
“It isn’t just New York and Los Angeles and Seattle. Per capita, Wyoming is where Los Angeles is, North Dakota is where Los Angeles is. You can go almost anyplace and these numbers aren’t an if, it’s a when for all of us,” Garcetti said in an interview on CNN. “So I’m just glad that we enacted measures early but it will take 10 or 12 days before we see that impact. I am impressing on everybody: Stay home this weekend, we closed the beaches, the hiking trails. Those things that are L.A. But it’s so L.A. Can rise again one day in the future.”
Garcetti discussed virus testing in the city, as well as how well Angelenos are complying with the shelter in place rules.
“No, I think it’s the lag and the tests on average in this country are sometimes five to seven days. So what you’re seeing is only the diagnosed cases and you’re seeing a week ago. If we want to know where we are today, we’ll know in a few days,” he said. “I’ve ramped up testing just paid for by the city, drive through centers, four, we just opened up the fifth. I announced an historic agreement with UPS where they’ll drop off tests, pick them up and we need to know so we can chase down the cases we have while there’s time.
“This has been marvelously embraced by 99.9 percent of the people. But we’re going to hunt down the last 1 percent and say, ‘You got to get inside, you got to cut it out and distance.'”

655,An Ultimate Political Chameleon Changes Color Yet Again,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/an-ultimate-political-chameleon-changes-color-yet-again/,"In some respects, Lincoln Chafee should have had a long and storied political career.
The son of the one of the most respected senators in all American history, the late John Chafee (R-RI), Lincoln Chafee should have had doors just open before him.
And, for a brief time, they did.
The younger Chafee took his father’s seat in the Senate when the elder Chafee passed away.
He became the only Republican in the Senate to vote against authorization of use of force in Iraq in the run-up to the 2003 invasion.
However, by that time already, New England liberal Republicans had become a dying breed, and Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse defeated Chafee for re-election.
So Chafee came back as an independent, and got elected as governor of Rhode Island.
It was during his term as governor that Chafee morphed once again. He not only registered as a Democrat, he ultimately announced that he was running for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.
Of course, in that race, he was was steamrolled by both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.
That was five years ago, and I think that we all reasonably assumed that we had seen the last of Lincoln Chafee on the public stage.
Today, the 67-year-old Chafee is proving us wrong.
He’s apparently trying to run for president again–this time as a Libertarian.
For crying out loud, the man needs to figure out who the hell he is.
A Libertarian?
I’m mean, why not, he’s been everything else.
But seriously, what is this man’s core political principles???
As the Republican Party marched rightward over the last quarter century, Chafee had a reasonable narrative for voters to switch to independent and even register Democratic, as most of New England was at point.
But the Libertarian Party has almost nothing in common with the Democratic Party.
Watch how Chafee is received in his latest adoptive party.
Could it end up as one political transformation too many?

656,"U.S. Military Still Able to Defend Nation During Coronavirus, Retired Marine Corps Colonel Says",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/u-s-military-still-able-to-defend-nation-during-coronavirus-retired-marine-corps-colonel-says/,"The US military is still in a position to defend the nation despite the country being caught up in the midst of the novel coronavirus outbreak and COVID-19 pandemic, according to a former senior Marine Corps officer.
In the United States, there have been 105,778 confirmed cases and 1,731 deaths, according to the most recent figures.
Despite the United States now being the epicenter of the worldwide pandemic, the nation’s armed forces remain capable meeting the long-standing expectation that the military be able to fight a war on two fronts, said Lt. Col. (ret.) Dakota Wood, today a defense analyst with the right-wing Heritage Foundation.
“Oh, absolutely. I mean the force has fairly low numbers of people who have been infected by that. The posture is the same today as it was a month or two months or six months ago,” Wood said in an interview on Fox News.
“We haven’t degraded, in any way, the fighting capacity or readiness of the force. They want to prevent that from happening. So this is an extreme preventive measure to make sure that the military can continue to do what we expect it to do,” Wood added, commenting on an order from Defense Secretary Mark Esper freezing all U.S. troop movement overseas.
The freeze expected to affect some 90,000 troops including those scheduled to return home and those scheduled to deploy.

657,Biden Assures Late Night Audience Trump Can’t Postpone Election Due to Coronavirus,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/biden-assures-late-night-audience-trump-cant-postpone-election-due-to-coronavirus/,"Donald Trump does not have the authority to try to postpone the 2020 presidental election because of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, former vice president Joe Biden told viewers of comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s late night TV show.
With the United States under conditions of social distancing and lockdowns to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the future of this year’s elections have been a question, and Kimmel asked Biden if Trump could simply postpone the election to a later date.
(In fact, Kimmel himself–like many other TV hosts now–is now broadcasting his program from his home with Biden joining from his own remote video hook-up.)
“No, he doesn’t have the authority to do that. Now, it’s possible that he may start a drumbeat saying it should be postponed. But Jon Meacham, who’s become a friend, he’s an historian, pointed out that we’re in a position where we’ve had elections in the middle of Civil War, during the Civil War, and during World War I, World War II, what happened with the virus in 1917?” Biden said, referring to Meacham’s recent proposals to engineer this year’s elections with mail-in ballots, or what Meacham terms “curbside democracy.” “Democracy and dealing with this crisis have to be able to be done at the same time.
“What I think you’re going to see more of, Jimmy, is I think you’re going to see more of what [Sen.] Amy Klobuchar had been proposing, and that is being able to vote early in your areas and by mail. I think we’re going to see more of that happening as well,” added Biden, who appears to be leading in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination this year.
Kimmel asked Biden if Klobuchar is on Biden’s list for a running mate, as Biden as committed selecting a woman. A Minnesota Democrat, Klobuchar ran for president herself before dropping out earlier this month.
“Is she on your list?” Kimmel asked.
“She is fully qualified to be president,” Biden said.
Kimmel also asked his guest if he thought Trump will debate Biden in the fall or would Trump try to dodge that.
“I don’t know,” Biden replied. “I hope we debate. I’m looking forward to that.”
General election presidental debates between the major party candidates are organized and run by the bipartisan Commission on Presidental Debates.
The last time an incumbent president refused to debate his challenger was Richard Nixon, in 1972.
The Democratic National Committee proved that a debate can be held in the midst of the pandemic, as it held its most recent debate between Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt).
Originally set for Phoenix, Ariz., the DNC moved the encounter to a studio in Washington DC, held without a studio audience.

658,Dr. Birx on ICUs and Ventilators: We Currently Have No Supply Shortage,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/dr-birx-on-icus-and-ventilators-we-currently-have-no-supply-shortage/,"White House coronavirus task force member, Dr. Deborah Birx, blasted media outlets for fearmongering about ventilator and ICU bed shortages, and for sharing reports from hospital workers who say soon patients will not be able to get the support they need. The reports also describe how hospitals are considering a blanket do-not-resuscitate (DNR) policy for COVID-19 patients, because if doctors and nurses are exposed to the virus, the cost to other patients may be too great.
“Please, for the reassurance for people around the world, to wake up this morning and look at people talking about creating DNR situations, do not resuscitate for patients, there is no situation in the United States right now that warrants that kind of discussion,” Dr. Birx explained Thursday evening at a press conference.
“You can be thinking about it in a hospital. Certainly many hospitals talk about this on a daily basis. But to say that to the American people, to make the implication that when they need a hospital bed it won’t be there, or when they need that ventilator it won’t be there, we don’t have evidence of that right now.”

Dr. Birx further emphasized to the public that New York state was not experiencing shortages of ICU beds or ventilators.
“We’re reassured, in meeting with our colleagues in New York, that there are still ICU beds remaining and there are still significant, over 1,000 or 2,000 ventilators that have not been utilized yet,” she noted.
Dr. Kamini Doobay, an emergency medicine resident physician in New York City, is one of the hospital workers who expressed concerns that life-saving supplies are dwindling. She warned that if there was a sudden surge of COVID-19 cases, hospitals will be overwhelmed.

“We could potentially get to a point where there has to be a rationing of ventilators. At the rate that this virus is exponentially transmitting, you know, transmission at this stage, I go home every single night and think about what if we had to decide between two patients,” she said. “I’ve never felt so physically and emotionally burdened in my life, I’ve never felt so deeply sad and distraught.”
So far, New York has more than 44,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and since Friday morning, approximately 1,583 infected patients are in intensive care units.
In New York City, a makeshift morgue has been set up outside Bellevue Hospital, as part of the city’s emergency contingency plans.
MSNBC’s Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski questioned the claims Dr. Birx made, suggesting President Donald Trump had pressured her into downplaying the situation’s severity.

“You’re hearing from the front lines across the country that they are in dire need of equipment and supplies and they have people overrunning the hospital,” Brzezinski remarked. “Explain to me, Dr. Birx, if I may, because I’m very concerned at the pressure top scientists at the White House are being put under by President Trump. I want to understand why Bellevue Hospital has a makeshift morgue, why The New York Times was able to get video out of an ER–of patient after patient–just lying there dying with COVID-19. The front lines are telling a very different story.”
Brzezinski also quoted an article by The Washington Post, which stated that “as cases mount amid a national shortage of personal protective equipment or PPE, hospitals are beginning to implement emergency measures that will either minimize, modify or completely stop the use of certain procedures on patients with COVID-19.”
In a final comment, Brzezinski called on “scientists at the top” to not “get bullied by the president because we need you.”

According to a recent United States Conference of Mayors survey, 85 percent of American cities “do not have an adequate supply of ventilators for use by health facilities in their city or area,” and 91.5 percent “of the cities do not have an adequate supply of face masks for their first responders (including police, fire, and EMTs) and medical personnel.”

659,How Exactly Did President Obama Respond to the H1N1 Flu Pandemic?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/how-exactly-did-president-obama-respond-to-the-h1n1-flu-pandemic/,"In the past month, President Donald Trump has repeatedly compared his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic to former President Barack Obama’s H1N1 response in 2009. He argues that his administration’s approach has been a lot more efficient and effective, whereas Obama’s was a complete failure.
“If you go back and look at the swine flu and what happened with the swine flu, you’ll see how many people died and how actually nothing was done for such a long period of time, as people were dying all over the place. We’re doing it the opposite. We’re very much ahead of everything,” Trump said in a meeting with the prime minister of Ireland.
Later, at a press briefing March 17, Trump reiterated this rhetoric: “If you look at swine flu — the whole thing in, I guess it was 2009, and what they did and the mistakes they’ve made, they were terrible. They were horrific mistakes. 17,000 people died.”
On Twitter, Trump provided insight into what he believed the “horrific mistakes” were:
“The USA was never set up for this, just look at the catastrophe of the H1N1 Swine Flu (Biden in charge, 17,000 people lost, very late response time), but it soon will be. Great decision to close our China, and other, borders early. Saved many lives!”
He also retweeted the following tweet made by Turning Point USA’s founder Charlie Kirk:
“This is your daily reminder that it took Barack Obama until October of 2009 to declare Swine Flu a National Health Emergency. It began in April of ’09 but Obama waited until 20,000 people in the U.S. had been hospitalized & 1,000+ had died.”
Just how accurate were Trump’s claims? How exactly was Obama’s H1N1 response? Did the “media” really do nothing or downplay it’s effects?
The H1N1 pandemic spread drastically across the globe from 2009 to 2010. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that the “virus was a unique combination of influenza virus genes never previously identified in either animals or people.”
From Apr. 12, 2009, to Apr. 10, 2010, the CDC estimated that H1N1 infected around 60 million citizens in the United States, hospitalized over 260,000 and caused 12,469 deaths.
The H1N1 outbreak occurred during the Obama administration’s first year in office. Although Joe Biden was the vice president, he was not put in charge of handling the H1N1 crisis. Obama gave the majority of the responsibility to the leaders of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the CDC.
The first two cases of H1N1 were confirmed on Apr. 17, in California. On April 24, during a briefing on H1N1, former CDC acting director Richard Besser said the following:
“In terms of the issue of containment, you know, there are things that we see that suggest containment is not very likely and that we’re seeing cases in Texas and we’re seeing cases in San Diego without any connection between them which makes us think that there has been transmission from person to person through several cycles.”
Days later, Obama declared a public health emergency. At that point in time there were 20 confirmed cases and no swine flu related deaths in the United States. He also made an emergency funding request for the H1N1 outbreak to Congress, to help aid development of a vaccine and for other needed measures.

In a speech to the National Academy of Sciences, Obama reassured the public that he was “closely monitoring the emerging cases of swine flu in the United States,” and while “this is obviously a cause for concern and requires a heightened state of alert…it is not a cause for alarm.”
He added that the declaration was a “precautionary tool to ensure that we have the resources we need at our disposal to respond quickly and effectively.”
However, soon after Obama had emphasized that swine flu was “not a cause for alarm,” Biden remarked on NBC’s Today show that he would tell his family members to avoid air and subway travel amid the outbreak.
Biden’s comment caused public concern and confusion, as it contradicted Obama’s previous message. In particular, Biden was blasted by the travel industry for unnecessary fearmongering.
“Vice President Biden’s comment that people should avoid air travel in response to the H1N1 flu outbreak was extremely disappointing,” noted James C. May, who at the time was the CEO of the Air Transport Association (ATA). “The airlines have been working daily with government agencies, none of whom suggest people avoid air travel, unless they are not feeling well.”
Following the backlash, Robert Gibbs, who served as White House press secretary for the Obama administration, apologized on behalf of Biden.
“Obviously, if anybody was unduly alarmed for whatever reason, we would apologize for that. And I hope that my remarks and remarks of people at CDC and Secretary [Janet] Napolitano have appropriately cleared up what he meant to say,” Gibbs said at a White House briefing.
On April 28, 11 days after the first H1N1 cases in the United States had been discovered, a test to detect swine flu was created and cleared for use. According to the CDC’s summary report, “On May 1, 2009, CDC test kits began shipping to domestic and international public health laboratories. (Each test kit contained reagents to test 1,000 clinical specimens). From May 1 through September 1, 2009, more than 1,000 kits were shipped to 120 domestic and 250 international laboratories in 140 countries.”

On June 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared H1N1 a pandemic, and the alert level was raised to phase 6. Despite this announcement, the CDC explained that this decision was “a reflection of the spread of the new H1N1 virus, not the severity of illness caused by the virus.”
Months after the pandemic declaration, an effective vaccine for H1N1 was developed, and by early October the first dose of vaccinations were sent out.
However, the vaccine program was not without shortcomings; there were shortages due to delays in the manufacturing process.
Obama had claimed that 160 million doses would readily be available in October, and vaccine production would be swift. Yet, in actuality, the amount sent out in October was less than 30 million. As a result, Obama received heavy criticism for his overly optimistic and misleading estimation regarding vaccine supply.
“The fact that there are vaccine shortages is a huge problem,” remarked Sen. Susan Collins in late October. “I believe the administration took the pandemic seriously, but I also believe administration officials were so determined to show that everything was under control that they sent the wrong signals about the adequacy of supplies of the vaccine.”
An HSS Report evaluating the Obama administration’s performance further pointed out that “most of the vaccine arrived too late to vaccinate much of the public before the pandemic peaked.”

The Obama administration also faced scrutiny for how vaccines were distributed. Vaccines were sent out to states based on their population size, and health experts have since argued that the distribution should have been targeted more, such as prioritizing sending the vaccines to hospitals and areas where H1N1 had spread the most.
By the end of October, when more than 1,000 people had died due to swine flu, Obama declared the outbreak a national emergency. At the time, Obama made it clear that the declaration was to simply enable Kathleen Sebelius, who served as the health and human hervices secretary, the ability to alter and lift certain bureaucratic requirements to provide more support to hospitals. For example, it gave Sebelius the power to allow hospitals to set up off-site treatment sites if they were overwhelmed with patients.
“The 2009 H1N1 pandemic continues to evolve. The rates of illness continue to rise rapidly within many communities across the nation, and the potential exists for the pandemic to overburden health care resources in some localities,” Obama explained in the declaration. “Thus, in recognition of the continuing progression of the pandemic, and in further preparation as a nation, we are taking additional steps to facilitate our response.”
“This is not a response to any new developments,” added Reid Cherlin, who was a White House spokesman. “It’s an important tool in our kit going forward.”
Throughout the H1N1 outbreak, Obama generally consistently shared public health information, and addressed what measures citizens needed to be taking to protect themselves from the virus. Obama also refuted misinformation quickly, such as the rumor that getting the vaccine would be compulsory for all citizens.
Moreover, a dedicated website for the swine flu pandemic — Flu.Gov — was set up. Sebelius described it as a highly convenient “one-stop shop for people to get information.”
The media coverage of H1N1 increased drastically from late April, after Mexico reported their first H1N1 fatalities. The Project for Excellence in Journalism discovered that in the week April 27, – May 3, across 55 new outlets, 31 percent of news coverage was swine flu related. In 86 percent of U.S. news stories, Catherine Goodall and her colleagues found that severity information was either a prominent topic, or at least mentioned.
Media outlets, though, were accused by some Americans of overhyping the pandemic. A Gallup poll, conducted May 5, 2009 found that 45 percent of Americans believed the media had overexaggerated the deadliness of swine flu.
Despite this, Dr. Goldacre, a British physician, suggested that the majority of U.S. media outlets did not overhype the pandemic’s severity or give false coverage. Rather, it just seemed that way because the media focused on reporting the potential risks.
“Everyone is just saying: we don’t know, it could be bad, and the newspapers are reporting that. Sure, there’s a bit of vaudeville in the headlines, but they’re not saying things that are wrong,” Dr. Goldacre explained.
“They were risks, risks that didn’t materialise, but they were still risks. That’s what a risk is. I’ve never been hit by a car, but it’s not idiotic to think about it,” he added.
On Aug. 10, 2010, over a year since the first cases had been detected in the United States, the WHO announced that H1N1 was no longer a pandemic.

He had “a fever for five days, horrendous back pain, headache, cough, and tiredness.”
Soon after arriving at a hospital, he collapsed and had to be put in a ventilator. Despite this, he could barely breathe and the doctors said nothing could be done.
“I was at the point where I was barely able to speak and breathing was very challenging,” he said. “I really thought my end was there. I had been through nine days of solid pain and for me, the end was there. So I made some calls to say in my own way goodbye to my friends and family.”
However, a friend sent him information about hydroxychloroquine, a drug touted by President Trump as having lots of potential, though experts have warned to be cautious.
Giardinieri talked to his doctor about taking the drug, and after some discussion, his doctor agreed to prescribe it.

Then, the next morning, he “woke up at exactly 4:45 in the morning, [and] woke up like nothing ever happened.”
He currently has no symptoms of the disease, though it’s uncertain if he’s been tested again.
Would he have recovered without the drug?
Doctors don’t know, as there’s ancedotal evidence that hydroxychloroquine actually works, but Giardinieri credits the drug with saving his life.
“To me, there was no doubt in mind that I wouldn’t make it until morning,” said Giardinieri. “So to me, the drug saved my life.”
After Trump announced that hydroxychloroquine could be a potential treatment, people around the world raced to buy the drug, with some pharmacies reporting to be “overwhelmed.”
Previously, a couple was hospitalized, and the husband died after hearing about chloroquine on TV being touted by Trump as a cure and taking chloroquine phosphate, from tablets meant for aquarium cleaning. They had attempted to take it to try to prevent themselves from getting sick.

Hydroxychloroquine is form of the drug chloroquine, which are not FDA approved for treating coronavirus though there are clinical trials in progress, including in New York.
Doctors do not recommend taking hydroxychloroquine without consulting medical advice and there are potentially fatal side effects.
Chloroquine is however, approved for various other diseases and is generally considered safe when taken correctly, so doctors can prescribe it for patients. However, most doctors don’t recommend taking it preventively because it has potentially deadly side effects and it’s effectiveness, both as a treatment and preventive medicine, has not been fully studied.
The drug was first discovered by Chinese researchers as a potential cure, and a French study of a few patients who recovered after taking it brought lots of hype, though it had a very small sample size of 20 patients.
However, many top disease experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci–who has served as a top adviser to Trump about the virus–have stated that the efficacy of chloroquine and its forms on the COVID-19 illness “is anecdotal, it was not done in a controlled clinical trial. So you really can’t make any definitive statement about it.”

661,"Governors Hold to Social Distancing, While Trump Seems To Tire of It",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/governors-hold-to-social-distancing-while-trump-seems-to-tire-of-it/,"While the nation’s governors appear to be committed to the social distancing and lockdowns on a long-term basis necessary to try to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus and the COVID-19 pandemic, Donald Trump appears to be weakening in his resolve–at least if a Monday tweet is to be believed.
There have been more than 350,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The virus has killed more than 15,000.
In the United States, 33,404 have been sickened with a total of 400 deaths reported, according to the most recent figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
“This is not a short-term situation. This is not a long weekend. This is not a week. The timeline–nobody can tell you–depends on how we handle it,” said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). “But 40 percent, up to 80 percent, of the population will wind up getting this virus, all we’re trying to do is slow the spread. But it will spread. It is that contagious. Again, that’s nothing to panic over. You saw the numbers. Unless you’re older with an underlying illness, etc, it’s something that you’re going to resolve but it will work its way through society.
“We’ll manage at capacity rate. But it’s going to be four months, six months, nine months, you look at China, once they really change the trajectory, which we have not done yet, eight months, we’re in that range,” Cuomo added. “Nobody has a crystal ball.”
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) expressed frustration that social distancing is not always being enforced, such as in the case of crowds still visiting the blooming cherry blossoms in neighboring Washington DC.
“Well, so in addition to meeting with all of the governors, we have been meeting as a region with the governor of Virginia, with the mayor of D.C. We talked on Friday. We’re going to be talking again, I believe, tomorrow,” Hogan said. “We’re all taking actions and trying to work together, but yeah, the social distancing is not being enforced and it’s a little crazy to see the kind of crowds at the cherry blossoms. People have to listen. There are people that are out there, and you are endangering not only yourselves but your fellow citizens by not listening to these warnings. We have been getting pretty tough out here in Maryland on folks, limiting people to groups of 10.
“We were chastising all these spring breakers who came back from partying in Florida and told them they need to self-quarantine for 14 days otherwise they’re risking the lives of their parents and grandparents and friends,” Hogan added.
“People of all ages. Forty percent of our cases are under 40 years old. We had a 10-month-old, 5-year-old who have gotten this disease,” Hogan said. “People are kidding themselves if they think they should enjoy being out there, business as normal. We have get people off the streets and out of crowds.”
Meanwhile, Trump seemed to send a signal Monday that the social distancing should come to an end.
WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020
Along with sinking stock markets, these business closings are playing havoc with the US economy. Congress is at work hammering out enormous $2 trillion economic rescue legislation.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said that such distancing measures may be “extreme,” but he argued that abandoning them will lead to greater losses of life.
“If you don’t slow this thing down, it will sacrifice a lot more on the other end of the equation, and we’ve got to think about the human cost here,” de Blasio said during an appearance on CNN. He also said the country faces the prospect of “a health-care system that can’t function at all” if coronavirus cases continue to balloon.

662,"AOC Wants “Universal” Economic Stimulus Plan, but Also to “Tax It Back” from Rich",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/aoc-wants-universal-economic-stimulus-plan-but-also-to-tax-it-back-from-rich/,"The stimulus package plan, announced by Senate Republicans, aims to provide financial security for citizens during the pandemic, in a time of shutdowns, job losses, and isolation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declared the plan an “a bold legislative proposal” which will provide “direct financial help for the American people” and “rapid relief for small businesses and their employees.”
The package includes direct check payments up to $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples, with the amount based on adjusted gross income. For every child, the sum will rise by an additional $500. It will also include expanded unemployment insurance.

At present, the stimulus package is currently being negotiated in Congress.
On Sunday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) addressed the stimulus package and commented that although the package will offer more unemployment benefits, it does not provide enough support to workers such as freelancer workers and contract workers.
“One of the issues here, is, of course, we need to be expanding unemployment, but there are a lot of workers in our economy that will not be covered by unemployment because they’re hourly workers, they’re gig workers, they’re freelance and contract workers. And unemployment does not cover those workers, even though they’re essentially unemployed right now, their contracts are frozen up or their hours are drastically slashed but not completely slashed,” Ocasio-Cortez explained during CNN’s State of the Union program.
She said that to ensure all citizens are able to sustain themselves financially, everyone should receive direct payments, and the following year the money paid to the wealthy can be recovered through taxes.
“I do think it should be universal,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I hear the argument of people saying, why are you going to give a check to Bill Gates. One of the things that we’re saying is, tax it back a year from now so you don’t have to worry about a big complicated bureaucratic means test upfront, mail them out to everybody and let’s get it back from the folks that don’t need it next year.”
When asked by CNN’s State of the Union host Jake Tapper how much money did she think the government needs be sending directly to the public, Ocasio-Cortez responded by praising the plan suggested by the Financial Services Committee. Their plan involves sending $2,000 this month to every American and an extra $1,000 per child, while also pausing debts, rent payments, and mortgage payments.
“I’m very supportive of both those measures,” she remarked. “When you’re able to stop the money going out, then that money that you do give goes a much longer way.”

Speaking to Tapper, Ocasio-Cortez, who previously worked in the service industry as a bartender, expressed her concern for service workers who may be having their hours slashed, no tips due to a lack of customers, and even risk losing their jobs because of business closures.
“From the moment that the business closures started happening, I’ve been very scared for a lot of these workers. All I can think about is what I would have done just two or three years ago.”
Economic advisor Larry Kudlow said the new measures to combat the pandemic could total over $2 trillion, and the package is equal to approximately 10 percent of U.S. economic output.
However, Ocasio-Cortez stated that this amount is not enough, especially as the package includes corporate bailouts.

“If all of this money is going to bailing out the airline industry in a way that does not help workers, if it’s going to bailing out banks and other industries without helping workers, then it’s not going to be enough and in fact, it could be too big. So it’s really about how we’re using these funds,” she noted.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at this point in time there is no confirmed deal regarding the stimulus package: “from my standpoint, we are apart.”

663,"Ford and GM Building Ventilators: We Can Do It, We Need Directions from the Administration",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/ford-and-gm-building-ventilators-we-can-do-it-we-need-directions-from-the-administration/,"As the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread across the United States, the ongoing need for medical supplies is a critical factor in the battle against the disease.
In the United States, the latest numbers are 26,908 sickened and 348 left dead.
Among the most critical supplies are N95 masks, coronavirus test kits, and respirators.
Skilled workers in the Detroit area who have worked for the automakers could be put back to work, as those auto plants are temporarily shut down, perhaps some old auto plants could be retrofitted so as to increase production of ventilators and other needed equipment.
However, what’s needed is direction from Donald Trump, according to Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.).
“We have amazing engineers. We have the best workers, highly skilled workers that can turn it around. But it does take time. What they need are direct orders coming in. Now we have Defense Production Act,” said Peters, referring to a Korean War-era law which Trump recently invoked in response to the coronavirus outbreak. “The administration has to start saying, ‘We need these businesses to start doing that.’
“But I also want to be realistic about it. You have to change production lines from auto assembly. That is not something you can do overnight, but it is something you should start. I was talking to the CEO of Steelcase, a furniture manufacturer here in Michigan, he is ready to do that,” Peters added. “They’re not making office furniture — or they are still doing it, but office furniture, obviously demand is going down as people are working at home. But he told me, ‘We can make hospital beds, we can make gurneys, we can make partitions to be able to keep people safely separated.’ They’re willing to do that. They just need direction from the administration: ‘What do you want us to do? We can do it.’ In that case, going from office furniture to a hospital bed is a much quicker transition.
“Clearly, we’re going to need more hospital beds if the capacity in our hospitals is overwhelmed. We’re going to need that type of equipment. But we need action now. This takes time. We need direction now from the administration,” he added. “Start engaging the industrial and manufacturing muscle of this country, and we can do it.”

664,Is the Coronavirus Spreading ‘Very Quickly’ on Gas Pumps?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/coronavirus/is-the-coronavirus-spreading-very-quickly-on-gas-pumps/,"Exaggerated. There’s no evidence it is, but gas pumps could serve as a major vector for transmission.
There are ongoing concerns on social media that the coronavirus is “spreading quickly from gas pumps.”
Messages take the form of:
“I just spoke with a friend who got called into an emergency meeting at his hospital. He said the virus is spreading quickly from gas pumps. He said to wear gloves or have a paper towel touch the pump and throw the napkin or gloves out before you get back in the car. Please tell everyone you know. Shopping carts as well, wipe them down.”

This message is most likely false. There are no specifics about which hospital this “friend” spoke at, so even if it was true for his area, it doesn’t necessarily mean its true for every area.
According to the CDC, surface to surface transmission of the coronavirus is not thought to be the main way the virus is currently spreading. In fact, the CDC isn’t even certain the coronavirus can be spread through such a vector.
“It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.”
Furthermore, Dr. David Belk, an internist, and researcher at True Cost of Healthcare commented that this particular coronavirus isn’t especially more likely to be transmitted via gas pumps.
“I don’t think that there is any evidence that different coronaviruses can be transmitted in different ways. The difference in infectivity of different viruses within the same family (e.g. different coronaviruses) has more to do with whether a certain virus is able to target certain receptors in your cells than how you pick it up.”

“In other words, if someone who is infected with a coronavirus sneezes on you, and that particular virus is compatible with the target cells in your body, it’s likely to infect you. If not, it won’t. This is probably why some coronaviruses (e.g. COVID-19) are more infectious to humans than others like MERS were.”
Even if a gas pump is contaminated, wearing gloves, as advised, and/or washing your hands for at least 20 seconds after exposure should prevent infection, as long as you do not touch your face before washing your hands.
With that being said, it’s important to be aware that gas pumps could potentially spread the coronavirus, though it shouldn’t be a cause for panic.
A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the new coronavirus could survive on plastics and stainless steel for 24-48 hours. Furthermore, gas pumps have been found to house a large variety of germs due to the large number of people that handle them a day.

According to Dr. Belk, “Doorknobs and countertops would be at least as infectious [compared to gas pumps], if not more so, in such a situation. People open doors multiple times each day whereas most people only fill their gas tanks every few days or so.”
To stay safe just in case, he advises, “frequently cleaning all potentially contaminated surfaces, including doorknobs, phones, countertops, etc… with disinfectant cleansers might help as well… washing your hands (or using a hand sanitizer) after touching any potentially contaminated surface (including a gas pump).”
Our advice? Be cautious, but don’t panic. Gas pumps could potentially give you the coronavirus, so do practice precautions like using gloves, not touching your face, and washing your hands with soap. However, to say the virus is spreading especially quickly from gas pumps compared to other vectors currently is most likely exaggerated.

665,Coronavirus (COVID-19) Frequently Asked Questions,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/coronavirus/coronavirus-covid-19-frequently-asked-questions/,"What is the coronavirus?
The coronavirus, more accurately referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is a stain of coronaviruses that cause respiratory infections. Symptoms range from the common cold to pneumonia to death. This current pandemic involves the SARS-CoV-2 strain, which causes COVID-19, short for COronaVIrus Disease 2019.
How can I get tested for the coronavirus?
If you think you may have it or have had contact with someone that has gotten infected, call your healthcare provider. Do not walk into an urgent care center or emergency room. Your doctor will assist you with your next steps depending on the severity.
I may have the coronavirus. Am I going to die?
Almost certainly not. To date, the estimated death rate is three percent. That means 97 percent of people that get infected will recover, and scientists still aren’t certain of that number, with various experts saying it could be lower or higher. Generally, those that die are those with underlying health conditions, though young people can die from COVID-19 too.
What is the treatment for COVID-19? Is there a vaccine?
There is currently no special treatment for COVID-19 patients. Treatment consists of supportive care and mechanical ventilation if necessary. At this time there is no vaccine either, though there are ongoing clinical trials to study to effectiveness and safety of proposed treatments and vaccines. Any product claiming to cure or treat the virus at this time is a scam and will not work effectively.
How long does the virus stay on surfaces?
There’s little data specifically studying this strain of coronavirus, but other coronaviruses can stay on surfaces for up to nine days. This coronavirus behaves similarly to other strains so scientists estimate that it also has a similar survival time. The time greatly depends on the surface, environment, and temperature.
Does wearing a surgical mask help? Or should I buy an N95?
Due to the small size of the coronavirus, experts are not recommending you wear a surgical mask to help prevent the coronavirus, as it will be largely ineffective. Neither should you buy an N95 though, since hospitals and more-at-risk healthcare workers are already facing shortages.
Who is Dr. Fauci? What is he doing?
Dr. Anthony Fauci is a famed immunologist known for his work during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. He is currently the head of the NIADS and part of the coronavirus task force. He has served under six presidents and has been called a national hero for his expertise. He is currently doing many interviews with various networks in attempts to dispel myths, give people a clear idea of what to expect, and guide the nation. He has received some praise for being a straight talker.
What’s with the CDC testing failure coverage? What happened?
The CDC was largely criticized by the media for its slow testing, overly strict testing standards, and lack of transparency. Since then, it has rolled out testing to public health labs and some private corporations. President Trump has taken much of the blame for the failure, though he denies it and Dr. Fauci also cleared the president of fault.
What is our private sector doing?
Companies like Google and Amazon have instructed employees to work from home. Other companies have guaranteed pay even if people are unable to work. Biotech and pharmaceutical companies are working on developing cures and vaccines, as well as ways to streamline testing and contact tracing.
Can drinking water help prevent the coronavirus?
One of the purported “ways” social media has spread to help prevent COVID-19 is supposed “advice” from a Japanese doctor apparently treating the coronavirus that recommended drinking water every 15 minutes to prevent the virus. According to the post, drinking water will “wash down” the virus into your stomach, where the acid will kill it. The idea that “drinking water help prevent COVID-19” has been completely debunked.
Does holding your breath for 10 seconds check for the coronavirus?
Trending alongside other coronavirus fake tips is the message that Taiwanese doctors are recommending a self-check for the coronavirus, involving holding your breath for 10 seconds. These messages claim that if you can successfully hold your breath for 10 seconds, you have no lung fibrosis and therefore no COVID-19. Both the self-check and fibrosis diagnosis are false.
Will the coronavirus get worse?
Almost certainly. According to one of the most respected immunologists and top health official Dr. Anthony Fauci, we haven’t seen the peak of infections yet and the virus is “certainly going to get worse before it gets better.”
Will the virus go away with warm weather?
Scientists aren’t sure. There’s lots of unknown with this coronavirus, and there have been predictions that this coronavirus may become a seasonal recurring strand. As for if the virus will go away with heat, experts are also uncertain. Heat does have an effect on the survivability of the virus itself in vitro and some viruses die down during warmer periods.
If you are young, does it mean you are safe from dying from the coronavirus?
No. There are already many documented deaths of healthy people with no underlying conditions dying from the coronavirus in the age groups 6-21. Furthermore, we are also seeing a large increase in the number of “young” people being hospitalized for coronavirus infection.
Will the United States be locked down over the coronavirus?
While there are currently no plans to do so, officials have stated multiple times that there are no options being removed from the table and that they could possibly impose lockdowns on certain areas of the U.S. According to Dr. Fauci, “you never take anything off the table when you’re dealing with protecting the health of the American public.”
How many people will die/be infected?
Experts aren’t sure. They have pegged predictions in the U.S. at a 40-70 percent infection rate, and death numbers ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions. See more of the math here.
What are the economic impacts of the coronavirus currently?
Stocks and indexes, namely the SPX and Dow Jones have dropped over 20 percent because of fear over the coronavirus. The Fed has cut interest rates fo nearly zero, and there are estimates over four trillion dollars is needed to avoid a 20 percent unemployment rate. Various people, including billionaire Mark Cuban, have also called on the Fed to print more money.
What’s with all the coronavirus fake news?
There’s been lots of fake cures, prevention tips, and information regarding the coronavirus. Dr. Carole Lieberman, psychiatrist says that people are “spreading fake news of cures and conspiracies regarding coronavirus primarily because they are scared.”
Does taking colloidal silver prevent or treat the coronavirus?
No, it does not. As of March 20th, there is no FDA approved treatment for the coronavirus. The FDA also says colloidal silver has no beneficial health properties and is a risk to human health, causing potentially deadly side effects.
This FAQ will be updated daily. We recommend you subscribe below to receive the latest coronavirus coverage.

666,FACT CHECK: Holding Breath for 10 Seconds Self Checks for Coronavirus?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/fact-check-holding-your-breath-for-10-seconds-checks-for-coronavirus/,"False.
Circulating around Facebook and various Whatsapp chat groups are purported messages claiming that holding your breath for 10 seconds can be used as a “self-check” to see if you have coronavirus lung infection or COVID-19.
Messages have taken various forms, from claiming the method was developed by Taiwan doctors to Stanford.
Messages usually take the form of something along the lines of:

The new NCP coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days, how can one know if he/she is infected. By the time they have fever and/or cough and goes to the hospital, the lungs is usually 50 % Fibrosis and it’s too late!
Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning: Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stuffiness or tightness etc it proves there is no fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicating no infection. In critical times, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air!
These claims, however, are false.
That is, doing such a self check will give no indication of whether or not you have the coronavirus. Not only is there no evidence of any healthcare professional releasing such advice, Stanford released a statement saying they release no such advice.
50% Fibrosis?
First off, according to Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine, there is no evidence that the new coronavirus causes fibrosis. Fibrosis is the scarring of the lungs resulting from cycles of tissue injury and repair.
While some people’s bodies get lung fibrosis from pneumonia, which the coronavirus does cause, Dr. Thomas Nash, an internist, pulmonologist, and infectious disease specialist at New York-Presbyterian Hospital says that “fibrosis takes months if not years to develop.”

Even if the coronavirus did cause fibrosis, you wouldn’t know until much later, most likely after the disease has subsided. Therefore, even if the self check of holding your breath for 10 seconds tested for lung fibrosis, it would properly diagnose the coronavirus.
Unfortunately, the self check won’t diagnose fibrosis or the coronavirus. A fact-check by the Taiwan Fact-Check Center and Dr. Nash both reported that its impossible to self diagnose lung fibrosis — you would need to go to a hospital to get tested.
If you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, no coronavirus?
The test is also not accurate for measuring lung health. Those with underlying lung conditions like asthma may not be able to hold their breath for 10 seconds — with or without the coronavirus.
Being able to hold your breath for 10 seconds doesn’t mean you are safe either. Most people who do have the coronavirus has very mild symptoms — similar to those of the flu or cold. If you do get it, your lung will most likely continue to work fine, and you’ll still be able to hold your breath for 10 seconds.
According to various preliminary studies from China data, most patients who develop severe lung pneumonia and undergo lung damage are elderly patients, 60 years or older.

In fact, there’s also been reports that you can be asymptomatic, meaning infected with the coronavirus but not showing symptoms. In such a case, any self check for the coronavirus would be utterly useless.
Is there a self check for the coronavirus?
No.
If you think you may have the coronavirus or have been near someone who does, the only way you can find out is through a test at your local public health lab or from the CDC. Any other claims of being able to “self check” for the coronavirus are completely false and dangerously misleading.

667,Do “Virus Shut Out” Cards Work? I Bought One to Find Out.,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/do-virus-shut-out-necklaces-work-i-bought-one-to-find-out/,"A product that’s trending with buyers called “Virus Shut Out,” sold by Japanese company Toamit claims to kills viruses and bacteria, as well as prevent allergies. The “Virus Shut Out” is a necklace/card that contains chlorine dioxide that you are supposed to wear around your neck, thereby sanitizing the air around you. It’s supposedly effective for 30 days and suitable for “offices, schools, hospitals, and nursing facilities.”
While not specifically marketed to kill the coronavirus and prevent COVID-19, consumers have grown into a frenzy and swept up the product faster than Toamit can carry it. As of writing, the Virus Shut Out card is listed as sold out on Toamit’s official website.
However, despite its newfound popularity, there is no evidence that it works. The product is currently banned on eBay and Facebook.

While chlorine dioxide is an effective germ killer and used to sanitize surfaces, Dr. Ariane Davison – a virologist and immunologist – says that the necklace “will do nothing to protect you by inactivating respiratory viruses.”
” [T]he device is worn around your neck – nowhere near your nose and mouth which are the key portals for Covid infection. Should you bring the device closer to your face, the active ingredient, chlorine dioxide, would cause severe respiratory and eye irritations and skin burns, as it is highly corrosive.”
The Virus Shut Out necklace has already been banned by authorities in Asia but is still being sold.
Curious to see just what the Virus Shut Out card from Japan does, I picked one off a third-party seller — which was selling for ridiculous prices by the way — at $10 apiece.
About two weeks later, it arrived.
I suffer from seasonal allergies, and I’ve been having runny noses throughout the day lately, so I took the “Virus Shut Out” necklace out from its airtight packaging to see if it would live up to its hype of preventing bacteria, viruses, pollen, and allergies.
I put the necklace on and waited for it to do its magic.
A few hours later, I felt no different.
The dry pellet inside the necklace is supposed to react with air to form chlorine dioxide, so I thought maybe it just needed some time to activate.

I wore the necklace for three days, going out a few times to buy groceries and getting some weird looks from other shoppers.
At the end of the three days, my allergies were just as bad as before.
While I wasn’t able to test it on actual viruses and bacteria, the “Virus Shut Out” had essentially no effect on allergies and pollen, which it advertises as preventing.
I’m going to have to call BS on this one. Science is too. The “Virus Shut Out” necklace and other similar products are scams and will do nothing to prevent you from getting the coronavirus — or any disease for that matter.

668,"Trump Praised for Uniting Private Sector, Google Coronavirus Testing That’s Not Actually By Google",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-praised-for-uniting-private-sector-google-coronavirus-testing-thats-not-actually-by-google/,"President Donald Trump Friday declared a national emergency in an effort to help combat the spread of coronavirus, after a rapid increase of cases, mass gathering restrictions, and event cancellations. Trump said that the declaration will “unleash the full power of the federal government” and allow Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, to “waive provisions of applicable laws and regulations to give doctors, hospitals —all hospitals — and health care providers maximum flexibility to respond to the virus.”

He also emphasized that this will free up to $50 billion in federal funds, which he described as “a large amount of money for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.”
So far, in the United States there are at least 2,000 confirmed cases and 50 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) last Wednesday officially labeled the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, WHO Director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warning, “This is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector.”
Multiple states have taken action to fight against the coronavirus, including New York which has banned mass gatherings of more than 500 people.
At the White House Rose Garden, Trump further announced that he has been in talks with pharmacies and retailers to set up drive-through testing in critical areas, which would enable individuals “to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave [their] car.”

Retailers such as Target and Walmart are offering their parking lots for drive-through testing locations, while LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics and Roche said they were increasing the speed of test kit production. With these measures, Trump expects that “up to a half-million additional tests will be available early next week.”
Notably, Trump added that he was working with Google to develop a website, which, he said, can “determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.”
Today on the Fox and Friends television program, Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told the hosts that it “took the president’s leadership to bring together the private industry.”
“You have competitors, Walgreens, CVS, Walmart all coming together saying we will agree to use part of our parking lots to allow for these drive-through testings,” Verma remarked and commented that all the testing companies are doing everything in their power to process tests quickly.
During the interview, Verma also praised Google for working with the government to create an effective testing website for the public.

However, it is important to be aware that the website Verma and Trump referred to is actually being developed by Verily, a different division of Google’s parent company, Alphabet Inc., and although Trump insisted that the website would be ready soon at a nationwide level, Verily published a tweet to correct this:
“We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time.”

670,Why There’s So Much Coronavirus Misinformation and Fake News,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/why-theres-so-much-coronavirus-misinformation-and-fake-news-2/,"Amid the market selloff frenzy and the panic related to the COVID-19 outbreak, or, as CNN is now calling it, “pandemic,” disinformation and misinformation have both gone rampant.
From promoting fake cures, like colloidal silver, to fake statements from organizations like UNICEF, it seems that every day, a new conspiracy theory or fake “health advice” appears and starts trending.
Make no mistake, our normal news cycle is constantly filled with false rumors or downright lies from both sides.

However, new waves of coronavirus-based misinformation have been thrown into the usual mix of political fake news, which some of the mass-panic can be attributed to.
What causes people to make up conspiracy theories, send fake doctor’s advice to their friends, and promote bogus cures?
Well, part of it is the way Americans read the news. Studies have shown that more and more Americans are getting their news directly from social media, instead of credible news sites. Studies have also shown that many people don’t read news past the headline before sharing or making claims about it.
For example, this article, filled with dummy text past the headline, garnered over 46,000 shares, according to the Washingon Post.
However, regardless of global health emergencies happening or not, the way Americans read the news generally stays the same.
So what can be attributed to the rise of new misinformation regarding COVID-19?
Well, Dr. Carole Lieberman, board-certified psychiatrist, says that quite simply, it comes down to people, “spreading fake news of cures and conspiracies regarding coronavirus primarily because they are scared.”

“We all want to know why something is happening and what we can do to feel in control of it. With coronavirus, there are many unknowns, so people want to fill in the blanks so they can take back control and feel safer. We still don’t know the real origin of coronavirus because there have been so many cover-ups and confusing stories about it in China –from a wet market to pangolins to bats to bioterrorism.”
“We want to know [though], so this gives people an opportunity to provide the answer that they want it to be or that will get them the most attention.”
Dr. Barna Donovan, professor of communication and media studies at Saint Peter’s University, elaborates on this, “A growing body of research shows that people are attracted to conspiracy theories and fake news when they feel powerless and at the mercy of overwhelming, chaotic social forces they can not understand. The belief in evil cabals having created the coronavirus as a part of a grand plan for global domination is actually comforting for many.”

“It offers a way to find a reason behind the sudden threat of this disease and the economic instability it has wrought. Believing that there is some mastermind controlling events like this is more reassuring than to face the fact that disease pandemics can spread through the world on their own, suddenly, and with overwhelming lethality, and the world’s best and brightest scientists can’t do anything about it.”
And those fact-checks you’re citing to try to counter what you think are ill-informed people? Well, Dr. Donovan says it most likely won’t work.
“People are also attracted to beliefs like this because it gives them a feeling of superiority. Conspiracy theories make their believers feel like they are much more enlightened, intelligent, and aware of how the world really works than their friends and neighbors. Conspiratorial beliefs can boost the true believer’s ego. The conspiracy theorists are awake whereas everyone else is asleep or opting to be mindless sheeple who don’t question the official version of the events.”

“These conspiracy believers, of course, become enthusiastic evangelists of what they see as real truth behind the facade and lies spread by the mainstream media, scientists, academics, and experts. Conspiracists become the heroes of their own real-life action stories, crusading to save the world by opening people’s eyes to the hidden truth.”
Basically, it boils down to people being worried and scared of the coronavirus. People want answers, cures, and ways to prevent it. With so much unknown about COVID-19, some people simply can’t stand to wait for scientific answers or studies.
Therefore, when a potentially false piece of information comes along that purportedly offers “insider” advice or information about the coronavirus, people gobble it up and don’t think twice about sharing it or forwarding it to their friends.
Unfortunately, almost all the time, these rumors are false and sometimes even downright harmful.

671,"Most Americans Will Probably Know Someone Who Could Die Due to Coronavirus, MSNBC Doc Says",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/most-americans-will-probably-know-someone-who-could-die-due-to-coronavirus-msnbc-doc-says/,"While most Americans can expect not to die as a result of the growing coronavirus covid 19 outbreak spreading across the United States, they will probably know someone who may well perish from the disease, however, according to a virologist who appears on MSNBC.
Dr Joseph Fair emphasized his continued faith in the efforts of leading federal public health professionals, including Dr Anthony Fauci and others, in an appearance on air Monday.
“They are all consummate public health professionals. This is not their first rodeo, as we would say, and they have done this many times before. That being said, getting testing up and running is the most essential step and getting testing up and running in every place we can, in every city, in every public health laboratory around the country is key for us to understand how widespread this epidemic is. This is not to fear monger. It would be irresponsible for us to create panic when it’s undue.”
More than 700 cases have been confirmed in the United States, with the virus present in more than 30 states and counting. The outbreak is responsible for thousands of deaths worldwide, including 26 in the United States.
Eighty percent of the population is going to survive the covid 19 disease, while “typically a 15 percent to 20 percent rate of mortality for those individuals who are both elderly or have underlying conditions,” he said.
“I can say pretty much with certainty that each one of us, everyone in this country, knows someone with those underlying conditions,” Fair added. “So this is not a political thing. It’s going to affect voters on the left, right, and people that don’t even vote. We need to take it seriously. And even if you yourself are going to be okay, you still have the potential, and are, infecting others that are not going to be okay.”

672,Gabbard Shows How DNC’s Commitment to “Impartiality” is B.S.,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/gabbard-shows-how-dncs-commitment-to-impartiality-is-b-s/,"The next debate in the Democratic primary cycle will be held March 15 in Phoenix, Ariz. The Democratic National Committee changed the qualification rules last Friday, March 6, for the express purpose of excluding U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), whose anti-war stance has caused her to experience a near-total media blackout, especially on the part of such liberal “news” outlets as CNN and MSNBC.
This sudden rule change came almost immediately after Gabbard actually qualified for the debate by winning two delegates in American Samoa, her native territory, and stands in stark contrast to the rule change executed by the DNC to enable multi-billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s participation in the Nevada debate last month.

If the DNC’s treatment of Tulsi Gabbard seems unfair, don’t bother to tell them about it because they already know it’s unfair and they don’t care. Back in 2016 a class action lawsuit was filed against them and eventually dismissed on the grounds that the DNC charter’s promise of “impartiality and evenhandedness” was merely political rhetoric and not enforceable in court, so why should they?
In 2016, Gabbard resigned her position as Vice-Chairman of the DNC in order to support Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over Hillary Clinton, who nevertheless won the nomination and lost the general election to Donald Trump. Instead of fading from the limelight as every reasonable American would like her to, Clinton opened her mouth last November and implied that Gabbard was a “Russian asset,” whatever that means exactly.
Gabbard is currently suing Clinton for $50 million as a result of that slanderous accusation. Recently Gabbard called on Twitter for Sanders and the other leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, Joe Biden, to stand up for what’s right and pressure the DNC to allow her on the debate stage with them.
This might seem a little bit strange, but of course she had every right to make such a request, especially of Sanders, who can reasonably be assumed to owe her a debt of gratitude after her sacrifice on his behalf back in 2016. Biden doesn’t owe her anything, but, as has often been said, “It never hurts to ask.”
Neither Sanders nor Biden has any reason to demand that Gabbard be allowed in a debate with them. Indeed, it would be political suicide for either of them to do so — not because of the act itself, but because she would mop the floor with either of them. Gabbard is highly intelligent and her policy proposals make too much sense to too many Americans for either of the elderly candidates to reasonably refute.
It would, however, clearly be the right thing to do, in the spirit of impartiality and evenhandedness, even though those principles are optional in the politics of the Democratic Party. I personally fail to understand why Gabbard is messing around with the Democratic Party any more at all. Her policy proposals appeal to a much broader spectrum of American voters.
She has the support of a wide variety of people, from Green Party members to Libertarians and even Republicans. I personally know many Trump supporters who would gladly vote for her. This may seem odd, considering that among her proposals are a form of universal health care (called Single Payer Plus) and a universal basic income, but there you are.

Perhaps the reasons for Gabbard’s widespread support stem from her ability to compromise. Her Single Payer Plus proposal allows for private health insurance for those who want and can afford it, whereas Sanders’ Medicare For All proposal does not, for instance. The Green Party would likely nominate Gabbard for president in a heartbeat if she asked them to.
It’s quite probable that, if she campaigned for it at all, she could win the Libertarian Party nomination as well, and the Libertarian Party is on the ballot in every state. For reasons of her own, however, Gabbard continues to try and effect change in the Democratic Party. Whether her efforts will ever bear fruit remains to be seen.
The facts remain, after all of this, that Gabbard qualified for the next debate and the DNC simply changed the rules to exclude her. Whether Sanders or Biden like it or not, whether Democrat voters like it or not, and whether the DNC and Hillary Clinton like it or not, it is only fair to allow her to be heard by the American people in such an important forum.

Maybe Michael Bloomberg or some other liberally-minded billionaire should donate a billion dollars to the DNC on the condition that Tulsi be allowed to debate. Then I bet they’d change the rules back to what they were a week ago. Where is George Soros when the people actually need him?

673,"FCC’s Anti-Robocall Technology Still Isn’t Here, and Won’t Be For 18 Months",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/fccs-anti-robocall-technology-still-isnt-here-and-wont-be-for-18-months/,"Robocall scams involve the scammer phoning the receiver pretending to be someone else or an organization by using a spoof caller ID, and then manipulating them into revealing sensitive personal information or into paying a large sum of money, typically by using a pre-recorded message.
For example, if you answer the call, a recorded message might play saying you have a won free holiday vacation, and you need to provide your bank details to accept the prize. These scam robocalls are thought to cost Americans approximately $10 billion every year.
Recently, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) launched new measures to fight against robocalls, announcing that phone companies are now required to use technology that tackles spoofing of caller ID.  
On March 7th, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, during an interview on Fox and Friends with host Griff Jenkins, discussed in depth what the technology was and how exactly it would work.

“We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our latest initiative to crack down on this problem of robocalls,” Chairman Pai said.
“We have already pulled out the stops in terms of reforming our rules and going after some of the bad actors, and recently I outlined our boldest step yet, to demand that phone companies implement a new caller ID authentication framework called STIR/SHAKEN.
“Essentially this would give a digital fingerprint to every single phone call, so you would know when you got the call whether or not the call was in fact legitimate,” Pai added. “That is going to be a big step forward in helping protect consumers from this hassle and sometimes the scam of these robocalls.”
With STIR/SHAKEN technology, scammers who use spoofing to robocall would get blacklisted, and their calls to consumers would either be completely blocked or come with an alert informing that it is a robocall.
To be at its most effective, STIR/SHAKEN needs to be adopted by all phone companies, as it is only possible to verify caller ID if both the sending and receiving carrier are using the technology. 

“The biggest problem right now is that a lot of times when you see a phone number on your phone that seems to be from your area code, and you pick it up, it’s somebody else, who might be a world away. And the phone companies also might not know exactly whether or not that call was legitimate,” Pai remarked.
“By requiring them to implement this new STIR/SHAKEN caller ID framework, the companies will be able to verify the accuracy of that call, that digital fingerprint so-to-speak if it’s not there, then they can identify it as likely being a spam call, and that will enable phone companies to stop sending those calls over to consumers or at least identify them as being likely spam,” he added.
When asked by Jenkins during the interview when American consumers can expect to see this plan fully implemented, Pai answered within 18 months, and then went on to explain why it was such a long period of time.
“The FCC is proposing to mandate this framework be adopted within eighteen months, and I know that is a long period of time,” Pai noted, adding, “but one of the things that Congress has told us in recent legislation is that [an] 18-month framework would give the companies enough time to put all the technological tools in place, to be able to protect consumers.
“I am not just a regulator, I’m a consumer myself, we want consumers to get relief as soon as possible and we think that this framework is a good way of doing that.”

674,"Amid the Coronavirus Outbreak, I Went to China",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/amid-the-coronavirus-outbreak-i-went-to-china/,"With so much news circulating about this virus, it’s easy to get caught up in the politics or shocking aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak. Recently, I went to China to visit my in-laws and found a surprisingly positive light into a room that currently is darkened by fear and a generally bad impression of China.
On January 19, I excitedly embarked on my first-time China trip to meet my in-laws and celebrate the Lunar New Year in Harbin, the capital of the northeastern Heilongjiang Province, dubbed the “ice city.”

It wasn’t until my first day of travel that I heard of the Wuhan-based coronavirus on TV and saw a broadcast-station news van at the LAX international terminal. At that time, I never thought the virus would impact my trip — I was just excited to be traveling to Asia for the first time.
Once we were in Harbin, about 1,400 miles from the epicenter of the outbreak and with still little concern for the virus, I carried on with my trip and was looking forward to some home-cooked meals.
My 83-year old grandma-in-law, who lives on the sixth floor of an apartment with no elevator, prepared most of the meals and did just about everything one could expect from a doting elder, except pinch my cheeks too hard. The holiday food we ate included non-western dishes like silkworms, hairy crab, chicken stomach, squid with Chinese chives, hot pot and durian and less exotic, but uniquely prepared dishes such as sauerkraut, whole fish, porridge, dumplings, and oysters.
Most of these were sourced from a local wet market, which gets its name because it sells perishable goods, including live animals that are stored, sold and slaughtered in close proximity to other animals and humans. Authorities believe the coronavirus originated in the Wuhan wet market.

At the Harbin wet market, we were greeted underground by a cacophonous sea of shoppers and an abundant array of different vendors. Live turtles and crabs crawled at the sides of red, water-filled plastic buckets on one side. Across the way, flesh-toned butchered animal organs, like livers and pancreases, were displayed on metal trays. Retailers selling everything from dry goods to toys to Chinese herbal medicine also coexisted nearby.
While the turtles seemed crammed in their buckets, this market was also part of my wife’s childhood to the point where the smells brought back memories of home. Experiencing the wet market in Harbin made me realize how rooted in the community it was. To me, this impression created a view of the wet market somewhat at odds with the more extreme wet markets fraught with bats, civets and all manner of reptile that I had heard about in the media surrounding COVID-19.
As our visit continued, news reports and the overall commanding presence of the deadly virus intensified. Streets emptied.
Someone passed out from a non-coronavirus issue at a local McDonalds, causing widespread panic and news alerts.
My in-laws showed me a video about the government rapidly building a temporary medical center in Wuhan that contains over 1000 beds, and a family friend gifted my mother-in-law with a 3M facemask as a New Year’s gift.

Additionally, under government orders, all public ceremonies were canceled, tourist locations were all closed, and businesses were shut down but still required to pay employees even if they couldn’t work remotely. According to my wife, who grew up in China and lived in Harbin during the SARS outbreak, this was the first-time businesses across China have ever been shut down in this way.
Because public activities were largely canceled and my wife’s family feared for our safety, we mainly stayed inside – looking at old pictures, playing go and mahjong, getting a haircut and receiving cupping therapy. We were still able to go to the supermarket, convenience stores, the wet market or wander the city. 
During this time, government and media warnings kept the streets and the retail locations that were still open very empty. We went to the closed gates of Jile temple, the biggest Buddhist complex in Heilongjiang, and walked around an empty amusement park adjacent to it. This area would normally be packed with tourists and believers praying for a good New Year, but we only encountered a few old men playing Chinese chess, a man practicing his Qilin whip technique, and a few other pedestrians.
Though everyone was taking measures to avoid getting sick, the people we encountered in the city were all very helpful and friendly. While quarantine in Harbin was relatively light at the time I was there, the Chinese people I met all took it upon themselves to avoid getting sick or passing along any illness.
Notes were placed on doors about reporting symptoms to the government, US airline companies began canceling flights, and we were afraid to so much as sneeze when traveling in public.

Soon, all we could do was stay inside or go to the supermarket, a convenience store or the wet market.
Family and coworkers were also sending me urgent messages to come home, and it became clear that we had to leave China, or we would risk being stuck there, so we booked an early flight to back.
At the airport we all wore facemasks, there were large digital signs showing how to put on a facemask, and our forehead temperatures were checked at several waystations. We also had to fill out a form verifying that we had no symptoms of the virus and had not been to Wuhan.
Once we returned home, my wife and I underwent a fourteen-day self-quarantine and heard from my in-laws that the streets in Harbin were blocked and guards stood outside apartment buildings to ensure people only went outside a few times a week. Additionally, a family friend of my in-laws reported that her father turned himself into the hospital with great fear and sadness when he had a fever and cough – which luckily, turned out to be a cold. 

Of course, my positive-minded mother-in-law would never complain about such things, but it must have been distressing. My wife, who is a Chinese language teacher in Los Angeles, also informed me that many parents took their kids out of the classes at her school to avoid any contact with the virus.
It also saddened her when she heard one of her students say the disease was “made in China.”
Today, fresh from my 14-day voluntary quarantine, the universal messages of companionship from my hospitable in-laws and the opportunity to become better acquainted with their personalities resonate the most from my trip.
While some individuals or government policy may be to blame for this outbreak, it’s unfair to broadly condemn and shun all Chinese people based solely on their customs or outward appearance. I think it’s important to learn from incidents like COVID-19 and support more sanitary practices.
Now, COVID-19 is making its way to LA. At a time when something new, like this virus, appears and reshapes the world we live in, we should ask how we can become more tolerant, understanding and caring, not how we can shun people or isolate an entire culture.

675,"The Coronavirus is Chinese, says Tucker Carlson",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-coronavirus-is-chinese-say-tucker-carlson/,"This Friday, Tucker Carlson on his nightly political talk show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, discussed the recent coronavirus outbreak, what it would mean for America, and what action the United States should be taking to combat the threat. 
Carlson emphasized that the coronavirus crisis will definitely have an impact on the 2020 presidential election and the global economy.
“The virus is quickly becoming a global pandemic. Ultimately, it could kill millions. At the very least, it will reorder the global economy and change our politics. Could the disease help determine the outcome of our next presidential election eight months from now? Of course it could. In fact, it will,” he remarked. 
Since the coronavirus outbreak, the U.S. stock markets have plunged drastically. This Thursday, Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that from February 19, U.S. stocks had dropped in value by $3.67 trillion.

Carlson also warned viewers that the virus would particularly burden the U.S. health care system and reveal the system’s limitations.
“We’re about to learn the limits of our health care system,” Carlson said. “Conditions will be tough for the many thousands of Americans looking for beds to recover from the flu. In Seattle, they already are. But things will be even worse for anyone suffering from, say, pancreatitis or a burst appendix, not to mention countless other health emergencies, people like this may not get care at all.”
“Our system won’t be able to accommodate them,” he explained, “on a practical level, saving American medicine from collapse must be our leaders’ top priority right now. We need to expand emergency hospital bed capacity. We need to make certain we have enough lifesaving drugs and medical equipment. The basics.”
He then blasted the Medicare for All concept; the idea of a single-payer health insurance program which would cover every American citizen. Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic nomination in the presidential election, endorses Medicare for All, and if elected, would work toward putting this concept into action. 
“Is this really the time to invite the rest of the world to join Medicare for All?” Carlson remarked. “Probably not. That idea was always stupid. Now it’s clearly dangerous.”
Throughout the talk show, Carlson made clear to viewers that in his perspective, China should be held accountable for the spread of the coronavirus, and the negative impact it continues to cause worldwide.

“The Chinese coronavirus really is Chinese. It arose in that country for the same reason American businesses have sent so many of our jobs there – lack of health and safety standards and endemic corruption,” he noted. “China did this to the world and we should not pretend otherwise. That’s not xenophobia. It’s true.”
Carlson also addressed China’s influence over America, criticizing past political leaders such as former President Barack Obama for giving too much power to China, relying on them to manufacture products, particularly those related to health care. Indeed, China currently leads the global market in pharmaceutical ingredients; 95 percent of antibiotics in America are made in China.
“Our chief global rival has a total monopoly on the most important medicine in the world. That should worry you more than anything the political candidates are currently talking about. Imagine watching one of your children die from an infected cut. China has the power to make that happen,” Carlson stated, adding, “Our leaders should be held to account for this, for now, we need to work as if our lives depended on it to fix this problem.”
Nearing the end of the talk, Carlson praised Donald Trump for his approach of putting America first, and stressed that America needed to abandon globalism and become fully self-sufficient to rebuild the country and make it stronger.

“Trump said we’re going to start building and making things again. All we need to do is start believing in ourselves and our country again. He told us that it’s time to show the world that America is back bigger and better and stronger than ever before,” Carlson said, “that’s the governing agenda in the age of the Chinese coronavirus: abandon globalism, rebuild our country, make the things we need. A strong America is an independent America. There’s no other way.”

676,"Trump Says WHO Data is False, Democrats ‘Weaponize’ Coronavirus",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-says-who-data-is-false-democrats-weaponize-coronavirus/,"In the U.S., there are currently 11 confirmed deaths caused by COVID-19 also known as coronavirus. Case rates are on the rise, with the virus infecting over 90,000 people worldwide so far. On March 3rd, the World Health Organisation revealed that the death rate of reported COVID-19 cases is approximately 3.4 percent, making it more deadly compared to seasonal flu which typically has a death rate under 1 percent. 

Today, President Donald Trump discussed the COVID-19 outbreak on a live phone interview with Fox News host, Sean Hannity. 
Trump told Hannity that he believes the WHO’s COVID-19 death rate percentage is inaccurate, and instead the number is actually a lot lower.
“I think the 3.4 percent is really a false number,” he explained, “This is just my hunch, but based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this and it’s very mild. They will get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor. They don’t even call a doctor. You never hear about those people.”
He added, “When you do have a death like you had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California, all of a sudden, it seems like 3 or 4 percent, which is a very high number, as opposed to a fraction of 1 percent.” 
“But again, they don’t know about the easy cases because the easy cases don’t go to the hospital. They don’t report to doctors or the hospital, in many cases,” Trump said.
“So I think that that number is very high. I think the number, personally, I would say the number is way under 1 percent.”
Notably, Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, Mike Bloomberg, and Bernie Sanders have all heavily criticized Trump over his coronavirus response, claiming that not enough is being done, and Trump is not taking the virus seriously. 

“The American people need a well-coordinated, whole-of-government, fully-funded response to keep them safe from the coronavirus threat,” Pelosi stated, “Unfortunately, the Trump Administration has mounted an opaque and chaotic response to this outbreak.”
During the interview, Trump went on to dispute the Democrat’s criticism of his coronavirus response, arguing that their concerns are politically motivated.
“The Democrats weaponize the virus against the Trump Administration, they weaponize anything we do, and yet if they did it, they would be hailing it, but they do weaponize this. They know what a great job we’re doing, they know we have the best in the world and we’ve really shown it, even when you look at the small numbers in this country, they’re very, very small,” Trump said, adding, “[Democrats] will always say no matter how good you do, if you found a cure and everything disappeared within 24-hours, they would say you did a terrible job.”

677,Super Tuesday Proves Our Election Isn’t for Sale,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/super-tuesday-proves-our-election-isnt-for-sale/,"It turns out that Mike Bloomberg spent $500 million or so on….turns out not so much after all.
Bloomberg’s unique campaign approach of avoiding the early primary states in order to focus on spending hundreds of millions from his personal fortune on advertising to position himself to compete in the Super Tuesday states uniquely failed.
For his “Super-sized” investment, Bloomberg was rewarded Tuesday night with a whopping eight delegates. He didn’t win a single state.
Ever the businessman, seeing his return on investment, Bloomberg woke up Wednesday morning from this mess, promptly withdrew from the race as quickly as he entered and threw his support behind former vice president Joe Biden, who romped on Super Tuesday to a resurgent campaign.
Just days earlier, another Democratic billionaire, Tom Steyer, had pulled the plug on his own foundering campaign.
And just days before that, you had other Democrats complaining and moaning about “billionaires buying elections.”
(Donald Trump claims to be a billionaire, but that’s not why he won his election–and particularly since, unlike Bloomberg, Trump very eagerly accepted campaign financing from donors.)
So outside this potential Trump exception, which I’m not sure even counts as an exception, the lesson we learned Tuesday night is that billionaires may try to buy our elections–but we, the voters, are not buying.

678,FACT CHECK: Drinking Water Can Wash Away and Prevent Coronavirus?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/fact-check-drinking-water-can-wash-away-and-prevent-coronavirus/,"False.
In light of the ongoing coronavirus, various statements and posts have been posted to social media sites, offering conspiracies to explain the virus, to purported “ways” to self-diagnose yourself, to, most recently, so-called “advice” from a Japanese doctor apparently treating the coronavirus that recommended drinking water every 15 minutes to prevent the virus,
According to the post, drinking water will “wash down” the virus into your stomach, where the acid will kill it.

Below is the full message being posted to multiple Facebook groups:
AS RECEIVED: The new NCP coronavirus may not show sign of infection for many days, how can one know if he/she is infected. By the time they have fever and/or cough and goes to the hospital, the lungs is usually 50 % Fibrosis and it’s too late!
Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning:
Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stuffiness or tightness etc it proves there is no fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicating no infection.
In critical times, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air!
SERIOUS EXCELLENT ADVICE by Japanese doctors treating COVID-19 cases. Everyone should ensure your mouth & throat is moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY? Even if the virus gets into your mouth…drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your oesophagus and into the stomach. Once there in tummy…your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don’t drink enough water more regularly…the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS. That’s very dangerous.
Pls send and share with family, friends and everyone about this ! Take care everyone n may the world recovers from corona virus soon. May all be well n happy ????
A fact-check by the Taiwan Fact-Check Center already reported that the so-called self-diagnosis method is inaccurate, saying that, “…this rumor is an error message […] the inflammation of the lungs caused by the infection [coronavirus] usually starts with cough, fever, and sputum, and there is no sudden lung fibrosis without symptoms […] only a hospital can confirm lung condition.” (rough translation)
There was also no record of any expert recommending to “hold your breath” to check for the coronavirus. In fact, according to Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine, there is no evidence that the new coronavirus causes fibrosis.
A message similar to the second part was debunked by Snopes, which found that “No evidence exists to indicate that any public health authority is officially advising the public that a dry throat makes individuals more vulnerable to contracting the virus and that therefore drinking water is an effective prevention method.”
While drinking water does help bolster your immune system overall, there is currently no observed benefit of drinking water specifically in regards to the prevention and treatment of the coronavirus.
AP Fact Check also conducted a fact check, finding the claim to be false, and cited Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University who said that while medical professionals typically recommend keeping up fluid intake when sick, drinking more water will not keep anyone from catching the virus.

We also reached out to Dr. David Belk, a board-certified internist, and researcher at True Cost of Health Care, in regards to the validity of drinking water to prevent the coronavirus and the reason for it being false.
Dr. Belk immediately described the claim as false, adding “Coronaviruses, like most upper respiratory viruses, usually causes common colds by attacking the upper airways, which include the sinuses, upper bronchi, and pharynx, all of which are extremely moist all of the time.”
“This particular coronavirus is different from the ones that cause common colds in that it can attack the lower respiratory tract deep in the lungs which is how it causes acute respiratory distress. The lungs, like the upper airways, are extremely moist all of the time. How would moisture in the throat inhibit any virus that naturally targets such moist tissues as the upper airways and lungs?”
UPDATE: Dr. Belk has also added, “It’s simply not possible to “wash” all potential viruses entering your mouth or nose into your stomach. Viruses infect people by latching onto, then infecting target cells in our bodies. They do this quickly and effectively. A sip of water, or even a big gulp of water, won’t stop them from doing what they’re naturally programmed to do.”
If you see this post on social media, we recommend you report it to help stop misinformation.

679,Is Bernie Too Radical For Voters?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/is-bernie-too-radical-for-voters/,"Although Bernie Sanders in the battle to be the Democratic nominee still currently has the most delegates, at the recent South Carolina Primary, Joe Biden shockingly gained 48% of votes while Sanders only received 19%. Sanders, once seen as the most likely to win, must now enter Super Tuesday uncertain if he will win a majority over Biden.
On March 2nd, Stuart Varney, a conservative political commentator, discussed his thoughts regarding Sanders on Fox and Friends, with hosts Brian Kilmeade, Steve Doocy and Ainsley Earhardt. 
Speaking to the hosts, Varney criticized Sanders, arguing that the country is not prepared for the drastic changes he wants to implement, and his policies are too far left for the majority of voters. “[Sanders] doesn’t want incremental change, he wants a revolution in our society. Stop it being capitalist, which it always has been for 200 odd years, and make it into a socialist society.” Varney remarked, “I mean, that’s a revolution.” 
This comment comes after Sanders recent controversy where, in an interview with Andrew Cooper on 60 Minutes, he commended programs set up by the Cuban dictator, Fidel Castro, who led a brutal communist regime in the Republic of Cuba.  

Varney also emphasised that if Sanders was elected, his policies such as banning fracking would push businesses away and lead to an economic crash. “If he wins, the House, the Senate and the presidency, that economy crashes and the market crashes.” Varney explained, warning that “A Bernie presidency and a Democrat controlled Senate and house would be a disaster for America.” His view is similarly shared by billionaire Leon Cooperman, who suggested if Sanders becomes president the stock market would drastically tank. 
However, even if Sanders does become the nomination for the Democratic party, Varney noted that his ties to socialism could deter voters and lead them to support Trump instead. Both Varney and Kilmeade drew parallels to the 2019 UK election, where Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour party, suffered the worst defeat since 1935, losing 59 seats against Boris Johnson, leader of the Conservative party. This loss was a result of usual Labour voters voting for Johnson instead, citing Corbyn as too far left and therefore impossible to support. 
“[Corbyn] was so extreme, Boris Johnson not only got majority in the parliament, he became the prime minister because his opponent was so out there.” Kilmeade said. 
“Jeremy Corbyn was crushingly defeated, virtually ended the Labour party for at least the next five or six years.” Varney added, “I hope and pray that the same thing happens here if Bernie Sanders is the candidate.” Varney further pointed out that this could potentially occur, with 20% of people at Donald Trump’s rallies being Democrats.

680,Pete Buttigieg is Dropping Out: Who Will Be Next?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/pete-buttigieg-is-dropping-out-who-will-be-next/,"South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has officially announced that he is ending his bid for the presidency in a speech Sunday night in his hometown.
The mayor was a moderate among his other fellow candidates and was also the first openly gay candidate to earn presidential primary delegates from the Democratic party.

According to the New York Times, Mr. Buttigieg said that dropping out was, “the right thing to do, when we looked at the math.”
The announcement came after the results of the South Carolina primary were released, showing Joe Biden at number 1, with 35 delegates, followed by Sanders with 13. Buttigieg was distant fourth, garnering zero delegates.
As of Sunday, Buttigieg was third overall, with approximately half the total delegate of second-place Joe Biden, who had 50.
Previous caucuses showed Bernie Sanders at number 1, with 24 delegates in Nevada, 9 in New Hampshire, and 12 in Iowa.
The only outlier was Iowa, where Pete Buttigieg beat Sanders by two delegates.

Buttigieg tied with Bernie in New Hampshire and only got 3 delegates in Nevada.
Only a day before, Tom Steyer had announced his withdrawal from the race. A few weeks ago, Andrew Yang suspended his campaign.
As the election nears, more caucus results will be released, revealing just who the people feel will represent the Democratic party the best.
Bernie, a democratic socialist leads the race, with moderate Democrat Joe Biden following closely in behind. Pete previously sought to occupy Biden’s current position of the moderate runner. Upon seeing the caucus results, he presumably dropped out.
Currently, both the fourth and fifth place candidates, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, are in very distant fourth and fifth, with only eight and seven delegates respectively.
Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard, the other two remaining candidates, both have zero.
Gabbard and Klobuchar are both more centrist than Sanders, but slightly more liberal than Biden.
Polling aggregated by Real Clear Politics currently shows that Gabbard is polling, on average, only at two percent, even less than Andrew Yang before he dropped out. In terms of support, Gabbard currently polls the lowest and the numbers point to her as the least viable candidate, and therefore the most likely to drop out.
Furthermore, campaign finance data also shows that Gabbard has raised significantly less money than second-to-last Amy Klobuchar.
While Klobuchar does poll at only seven percent, she does hold a very unlikely, but possible, chance at winning the nomination, with 7 delegates. However, seeing Buttigieg, who was leading Klobuchar by a wide margin, drop out may potentially serve as a warning to Klobuchar about her chances.

Bloomberg has faired quite poorly among the caucuses, though he does currently poll at 16 percent, beating Warren, most likely due to his expansive ad spending.
Biden currently stands at 19 percent, Warren at 12, and Sanders at 30.
In terms of total fundraising, data from OpenSecrets shows that Bernie is also leading, with over 130 million dollars raised, followed by Warren with over 90 million dollars raised, and Biden, with over 70 million dollars raised. Klobuchar has over 30 million dollars and Gabbard only has 13 million dollars.
Bloomberg is completely self-financing his campaign and has currently spent over 440 million dollars already, more than any other candidate, despite announcing his bid late.
At this point, numbers-wise, Biden and Sander seem like the most viable, Gabbard will probably drop out soon, and Klobuchar and Warren will most likely be overshadowed by Biden and Sanders, with both of them having similar ideologies respectively. Unless Bloomberg can manage to grab some more delegates he will most likely drop out also.

681,"According to Mitch McConnell, All the Democratic Contenders Are Basically the Same",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/according-to-mitch-mcconnell-all-the-democratic-contenders-are-basically-the-same/,"At a recent press conference, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) discussed with reporters his thoughts regarding the current Democratic candidates running for president, and cautioned Republicans to not underestimate the amount of support there may be for Bernie Sanders in the election.
With Sanders currently in the lead at 45 delegates, Republicans have been in high spirits believing if he is nominated, due to his ties to socialism and far-left policies, it would enable Donald Trump to maintain a GOP majority and lead him to certain victory. During the conference, McConnell paralleled the Republicans’ reactions to what had happened to Ronald Reagan in the past: “I’m reminded of when the Democrats back in 1980 were all pulling for Ronald Reagan to be the nominee because they thought he’d be the easiest to beat.” McConnell explained. “I think Republicans speculating about which Democratic candidate for president would be the easiest to beat may be a bit foolish.”
In 1980, despite Democrats beliefs that Reagan would be too far-fight to triumph over incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter in the general election, Reagan won by a landslide. 

McConnell further remarked that “It’s going to be a contested general election with a lot of energy on both sides.”
When considering who he would like to be the Democratic candidate, he simply stated to reporters: “I will leave it up to the Democrats to pick who they’d like to be their candidate. If you look at what various candidates for president on the Democratic ticket are saying, it’s not a whole lot of difference between any of them.”
McConnell continued to describe them as all “very, very far to the left,” and added that “It looks like moderate Democrats are an endangered species.”

682,"Devine: Warren ‘Irrelevant,’ and Bernie ‘Hijacking’ Democratic Party",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/devine-warren-irrelevant-and-bernie-hijacking-democratic-party/,"On February 25th, Fox & Friends, a weekday morning news show hosted by Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, discussed the then-upcoming Democratic debate in South Carolina. Joined by guest appearance Miranda Devine, a New York Post columnist, they considered which candidates would be the most attacked in the debate. 

The hosts addressed that Bernie Sanders would be the most likely candidate targeted, particularly in light of his recent interview with Anderson Cooper on the CBS News program 60 Minutes. In the interview, Sanders controversially praised programs established by the Cuban dictator, Fidel Castro, who governed a callous communist regime in the Republic of Cuba for over a decade. This served as a reminder of Sanders’ previous praise of Daniel Ortega’s Nicaraguan government and his past engagement with the Soviet Union. 
“If you can’t tell [Sanders] that your fanship of the Soviet Union, Fidel Castro, of Daniel Ortega, is abhorrent to those who lost their lives,” Kilmeade remarked, “it’s going to be a repellent for anybody that has a sense that they want to be free and have a degree of liberty in their life.”
Although it is uncertain how this controversy will affect support for Sanders, he is currently in the lead at 45 delegates, beating Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. During the talk show, Devine criticized Sanders for “hijacking” the Democratic party and the party’s nomination of him despite his far-left policies. “It shows you just how far they have lost their way.” Devine explained, “This is nothing like when Donald Trump was nominee for the Republicans, because his policies economically are not that much different from the Republican Party; whereas with Bernie Sanders, he is way off to the left, he’s dragging, he’s hijacking that party.”

The hosts and Devine mutually agreed that both Sanders and Donald Trump would be heavily under the firing line, and as a result, Democratic candidate Mike Bloomberg would be targeted less. “The one that will probably escape tonight is Mike Bloomberg,” Kilmeade proposed, “because there’s a desperation to stop Bernie, while Bloomberg will probably sit back and attack but will not be as attacked as much, I would imagine.” 
Miranda Devine further went on to remark that Elizabeth Warren is now “irrelevant” in the presidential election, likely referring to Warren’s recent underperformance where she only placed third in the Iowa caucuses and fourth in New Hampshire

683,The Value of A Polarizing Op-ed: Do We Have The Critical Thinking to Make it Worthwhile?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/the-value-of-a-polarizing-op-ed-do-we-have-the-critical-thinking-to-make-it-worthwhile/,"When The New York Times this week published an opinion article, better known as an “op-ed,” by the deputy of the Taliban, the newspaper created a firestorm.
However, the article falls squarely in the tradition of op-ed pages of major American newspapers for decades. Op-eds, including the most polarizing opinion pieces such as the one penned by the Taliban spokesman, serve an important function, if only we are capable of enough critical thinking to make them worthwhile, according to Donna Halper, a media historian, professor, author and former radio broadcaster.
The Times attracted a fair bit of criticism with the publication of the article titled “What We, The Taliban, Want,” including an angry tweet from Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.)
I have some questions for @nytimes since they decided to give the Taliban a forum to spew garbage, like, “We did not choose our war…We were forced to defend ourselves.”
1. Remember 9/11?
2. The author is a designated global terrorist. Did you pay him for this piece?
— Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) February 20, 2020
These sorts of op-eds can serve an important purpose and are not meant merely to inflame the sensibilities of readers, Halper said.
The point is to read the opinion with a critical–but not cynical–eye.
“But what if the Taliban really are trying to be more modern? What if they really are interested in trying to come to some compromises?” Halper asked. “How should we in the West respond, or is it in fact not our business what Afghan citizens do in their country?
“I see opinion pieces as opportunities for debate and discussion, and I believe a piece like this provides both,” she added.
Halper said that she is skeptical about the Taliban still being good for women’s rights, and is dubious about their reading of Islam being the only acceptable reading.
Halper adds, however, that these sorts of articles won’t be helpful if they’re “just going to be weaponized to generate social media outrage.
“But if they can be the beginning of a serious and potentially productive discussion, if they can provide some possible solutions for contentious issues, and if they can lead to a conversation grounded in ethics rather than anger, then perhaps they can serve a good purpose–whether we agree with each piece or not.”

684,What Are 2020 Presidential Candidates Planning to Do About the Opioid Epidemic?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/democrats/what-are-2020-presidential-candidates-planning-to-do-about-the-opioid-epidemic/,"With the last of the Democratic debates and the Iowa caucuses finished, the remaining candidates have debated solutions on some of the nation’s biggest issues from healthcare to foreign policy. But one big issue sweeping the nation has been left out and that is the ongoing opioid crisis. Opioids on average claim over 130 lives every day in this nation, but little, if anything, has been said about it on the national stage.

This does not mean that all presidential candidates don’t have plans to tackle this crisis. They just don’t have it as a focal point of their campaigns. Some plans are strictly structured around the opioid crisis, whereas others are part of a larger plan to tackle alcohol and drug abuse in general. With just under 20 percent of the population treated for drug or alcohol abuse, the problem has proven to be pervasive. Here are the proposals from a few of the candidates who received delegates in the Iowa caucuses below:
Pete Buttigieg: Previous South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete details another plan focusing on $100 billion but in the form of a ten-year community innovation grant program. His plan emphasizes prevention in the long term with a focus on accessibility for veterans. Since he does not have experience in the federal government like some other candidates, Buttigieg has no track record of sponsoring or supporting bills on the issue.

Amy Klobuchar: Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar has a platform in place to take mental health and drug addiction head-on. The 100 billion dollar proposal emphasizes investing in mental health and drug addiction treatment by expanding treatment capacity, providing early screenings, and investing in further research and development. While the details on how she plans to pay for it aren’t 100 percent clear, it does state that it will be partially paid by taxing the sale of all future opioids.
Bernie Sanders: Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has already presented legislation on the ongoing opioid crisis. In 2019, Bernie Sanders introduced the Opioid Crisis Accountability Act, which would hold the pharmaceutical industry more accountable for their wrongdoings by imposing fines for illegal practices done by manufacturers and criminal fines on executives involved if necessary. The bill has yet to be passed into law.
Elizabeth Warren: Senator Warren has a comprehensive plan to deal with the opioid crisis. Known as the CARE Act, her plan would distribute $100 billion throughout the country so that everyone gets the help they need. The money received depends on the size and needs of the state/city/territory. She plans to fund this by taxing the richest 75,000 people in the US.

While other candidates have addressed the issue, not all of them have fared well in caucuses so far. Or in some cases, such as Joe Biden, don’t have any significant plans outlined to deal with the opioid crisis on a national level. It’s safe to say that the opioid crisis hasn’t been at the forefront of a majority of candidate’s platforms. That is a shame because this health and social issue definitely deserves its own platform.

685,What is ISideWith’s Bias?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/what-is-isidewiths-bias/,"In case you haven’t noticed already, we display the ISideWith political quiz results of our frequent writers in a section above the content.
One question that is frequently asked regarding this is “Many political compass quizzes are biased. How do you know ISideWith isn’t?” or “Why are you using isidewith? It’s biased.”
Once of our writers, Mike Kauffmann, wrote an in-depth piece analyzing the bias of various political quizzes here.
Specifically, he found that ISideWith and People’s Press’s Political Typology quiz were the least biased, but isidewith was still biased in that they were emphasizing a two-sided answer approach, with their use of Yes/No questions.

We re-reviewed the quiz, and generally, found that the questions were generally unbiased and they tried to utilized user feedback to make their questions more unbiased.
However, we did find a few biased descriptions/questions that hinted at isidewith’s bias in general. Though we will note that this is most likely not done on purpose, but an example of subconscious bias, which is notoriously hard to get rid of.
Question: Should the U.S. raise taxes on the rich?
Description: Australia currently has a progressive tax system whereby high-income earners pay a higher percentage of tax than low income tax. A more progressive income tax system has been proposed as a tool towards reducing wealth inequality.
Votes: 60% Yes, 38% No
This question is pretty neutral and doesn’t use loaded words or have any slant, though it is a bit vague. However, the description and choices were somewhat biased towards making users choose “Yes.” The given answers were:

Yes
No
Yes, and raise taxes on all income brackets
Reform to a flat tax
No, but lower taxes for the poor
No, keep the current tax structure
Lower the income tax rate and remove all existing tax loopholes for large corporations
Abolish the income tax, disallow all deductions and increase the sales tax
First off, the description only provides a positive reason for increasing wealth tax (reduce wealth inequality), and doesn’t provide a con, making users more likely to support the “pro” side without being given any further info. Interestingly, 63% of users selected “Yes” for this question.
Furthermore, the lack of on option that says “No, and lower taxes on the rich,” which one would assume to be a common option, is also somewhat concerning.

Overall though, we would rate this question 2/10 for bias, and left for direction.
Question: Should the government require children to be vaccinated for preventable diseases?
Description: In January 2014, 102 measles cases linked to an outbreak at Disneyland were reported in 14 states. The outbreak alarmed the CDC, which declared the disease eliminated in the U.S. in the year 2000. Many health officials have tied the outbreak to the rising number of unvaccinated children under the age of 12. Proponents of a mandate argue that vaccines are necessary in order to insure herd immunity against preventable diseases. Herd immunity protects people who are unable to get vaccines due to their age or health condition. Opponents of a mandate believe the government should not be able to decide which vaccines their children should receive. Some opponents also believe there is a link between vaccinations and autism and vaccinating their children will have destructive consequences on their early childhood development.

Votes: 69% Yes, 29% No
The inclusion of the last line is comically misleading but important enough that we feel the need to point it out. It is a scientific consensus that autism and vaccines have absolutely no correlation. This is backed by the CDC, WHO, and various scientific studies and journals, and was put into the public eye by a flawed study. However, the inclusion of misinformation could potentially sway the results.
We aren’t giving a specific bias or direction for this since people on both sides generally agree that autism and vaccines are not correlated, and isidewith was most likely just including this statement to address the population that is underinformed/unwilling to accept this.
Question: Should foreign terrorism suspects be given constitutional rights?
Description: In 2002, the George W. Bush administration issued the Torture Memos which argued for a narrow definition of torture under U.S. law. They included granting the CIA authority to use “enhanced interrogation techniques” on enemy combatants. The techniques included waterboarding subjection to extreme cold and confinement in small boxes.
Votes: 24% Yes, 76% No

This question is slightly negatively worded. We feel that “Should the Constitution apply to the prosecution of foreign terrorists?“ is more unbiased because “giving terrorists constitutional rights” is vague (could be referring to other rights) and could generate a negative connotation.
Upon reading the description, it is clear that the question refers to the Amendment Eight on the Bill of Right, which says, “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted,” in regards to whether or not that should apply to foreign terrorists. However, the description isn’t totally relevant to the question itself. Instead of talking about the arguments for and against giving terrorist rights, it discusses the use of torture in the past, thereby withholding any context or further information needed to make a decision.

Therefore, we rate this question 3/10 on bias and for the right.
We went through the other questions and found that in general, the questions and descriptions on isidewith weren’t biased, but some were outdated, such as “Should police officers be required to wear body cameras?” which cites an Obama-era petition that has since been taken down (archive link).
If we had to give isidewith a bias, we would say it would have minimal bias in favor of the left, though it is generally nonexistent and pretty fair.

686,Breaking Down the New York Times Endorsement by Bias,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/breaking-down-the-new-york-times-endorsement-by-bias/,"On Sunday, the 19th, the New York Times released its Editorial Board’s endorsement. Or endorsement(s) in this case. The two candidates were Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.
They published an oped explaining their choice. Let’s break it down by the bias, assisted by our A.I, which you can try for yourself here (emphasis in the text below is ours).
American voters must choose between three sharply divergent visions of the future.

(A.I. Rating) [ -1.40 ] Not much bias overall, besides the implication that Americans can only choose three visions.
The incumbent president, Donald Trump, is clear about where he is guiding the Republican Party — white nativism at home and America First unilateralism abroad, brazen corruption, escalating culture wars, a judiciary stacked with ideologues and the veneration of a mythological past where the hierarchy in American society was defined and unchallenged.
[ -20.12 ] Woah. Let’s break it down. First off, there a clear anti-Trump sentiment here, shown through the use of negative terminology when describing him, such as “brazen corruption.” Here, we have an example of one-sided bias, where the NYT is purposely leaving out Trump’s more positive contributions and cherry-picking the negative ones to portray him as worse than he is. While some of the point may be factual (white nativism is debatable), the statement overall is very slanted against Trump (and therefore Republicans) and his ideologies.

Another example would be the implied parallelism by adding to the list, “America First unilateralism abroad.” Out of all the items listed, “America First unilateralism abroad” could be debatable whether it’s good or bad — conservatives generally want to prioritize America’s interest in foreign affairs — however, by including this item in a list that otherwise carries a very negative connotation, the New York Times Editorial Board is further one-siding that “America First,” a conservative value, is equivalent to white nativism and corruption in term of negativity.
On the Democratic side, an essential debate is underway between two visions that may define the future of the party and perhaps the nation. Some in the party view President Trump as an aberration and believe that a return to a more sensible America is possible. Then there are those who believe that President Trump was the product of political and economic systems so rotten that they must be replaced.

[ -7.45 ] More negative sentiment towards Trump. There are three things going on here. First, the notion that our nation is in shambles and it needs (the Democratic party’s) saving. Second, that Trump is making America “unsensible” and “rotten.” This is starting to seem more like a hit piece on Trump.
The Democratic primary contest is often portrayed as a tussle between moderates and progressives. To some extent that’s true. But when we spent significant time with the leading candidates, the similarity of their platforms on fundamental issues became striking.
[ 0.21 ] Not much bias here.
Nearly any of them would be the most progressive president in decades on issues like health care, the economy and government’s allocations of resources. Where they differ most significantly is not the what but the how, in whether they believe the country’s institutions and norms are up to the challenge of the moment.
[ -3.48 ] This paragraph is generally okay too.

Many Democratic voters are concerned first and foremost about who can beat Mr. Trump. But with a crowded field and with traditional polling in tatters, that calculation calls for a hefty dose of humility about anyone’s ability to foretell what voters want.
Choosing who should face off against Mr. Trump also means acknowledging that Americans are being confronted with three models for how to govern this country, not two. Democrats must decide which of their two models would be most compelling for the American people and best suited for repairing the Republic.
[ -5.38 ] Similiar to above, there’s firstly the slightly implied idea that we can only have three or two models to govern us, which is false. Then, its back to the idea that “Trump is bad and completely destroying us” and “Democrats are our savior” with the last statement

The party’s large and raucous field has made having that clean debate more difficult. With all the focus on personal characteristics — age and race and experience — and a handful of the most contentious issues, voters haven’t benefited from a clarifying choice about the party’s message in the election and the approach to governing beyond it.
It was a privilege for us on the editorial board to spend more than a dozen hours talking to candidates, asking them any question that came to mind. Yet that exercise is impossible for most Americans, and we were left wanting for a more focused conversation for the public. Now is the time to narrow the race.
[ 1.53 ] These paragraphs are pretty neutral, and I have to say, the line, “all the focus on personal characteristics — age and race and experience” is pretty well written and true, especially with the recent Sanders and Warren debate.
The history of the editorial board would suggest that we would side squarely with the candidate with a more traditional approach to pushing the nation forward, within the realities of a constitutional framework and a multiparty country. But the events of the past few years have shaken the confidence of even the most committed institutionalists. We are not veering away from the values we espouse, but we are rattled by the weakness of the institutions that we trusted to undergird those values.

[ -5.77 ] The New York Times has a clear history of endorsing Democrats, with the absence of any Republican endorsement since 1960. It could be that Republicans have gone out of touch, but it could also be the NYT’s liberal bias.
The line, “more traditional approach to pushing the nation forward” paired with the NYT’s history of choosing Democrats (26 versus 6 Republicans to date) could possibly be seen as a possible reference that Democrats and pushing the nation forward (and Republicans are not), though I’ll admit its a stretch.
“…the past few years” almost certainly refers to Trump’s presidency, and “shaken the confidence” once again carries an (unfairly) negative connotation towards it.

There are legitimate questions about whether our democratic system is fundamentally broken. Our elections are getting less free and fair, Congress and the courts are increasingly partisan, foreign nations are flooding society with misinformation, a deluge of money flows through our politics. And the economic mobility that made the American dream possible is vanishing.
Both the radical and the realist models warrant serious consideration. If there were ever a time to be open to new ideas, it is now. If there were ever a time to seek stability, now is it.
[ -8.46 ] Some little biases in here. The second sentence is partially referring to 2016 where the election was provably influenced by Russia. In the context of the previous paragraphs painting Democrat’s as a savior to this problem, the blame is shifted (but not directly) towards Republicans.
We’re going to stop here for part 1 for now — we’ll most likely be releasing part 2 tomorrow, stay tuned.

Generally, the biases so far have been unfairness and negativity towards Donald Trump, his policies, and the state of the nation.

687,"Ted Cruz: After Fair Trial, Impeachment Clown Show Will Come to an End",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/ted-cruz-after-fair-trial-clown-show-will-come-to-an-end/,"In a video posted onto his twitter, Republican Senator Ted Cruz addressed his follower regarding the House’s decision to send the articles to the Senate for a trial, referring to the ongoing impeachment trial as a “circus.”
After weeks of impeachment holdup by Nancy Pelosi in which she paused the proceedings by holding the impeachment articles in an attempt to force Mitch McConnell and the Senate to lay down rules for the trial, the articles were finally delivered to the Senate along with the named managers.

Cruz also claimed that the impeachment articles did not meet the standard of the Constitution for high crimes and misdemeanors and that the Senate was going to acquit the president.
Senator and Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch Mcconnell has also said in the past that he would work, “with the White House counsel’s office” regarding the impeachment process and that he was not an “impartial juror.”
Cruz said in the video:
“I’m headed to the Senate floor, getting ready for the start of the impeachment trial. The partisan circus that we’ve seen in the House is over. We’re getting ready to receive the House managers. Shortly after that, all 100 senators will be sworn in by the Chief Justice. “
“We will then proceed to have a fair trial, to respect due process, unlike the House, to give the President a full and fair opportunity to defend himself and then we’ll decide this issue based on the constitutional standard for impeachment, which is high crimes and misdemeanors. The House articles don’t meet that standard, they don’t allege any criminal conduct whatsoever. So at the end of this process, after a fair trial, the President will be acquitted and we will end this constitutional circus, this political farce that started in the House. This is the beginning of the end of the abuse of the Constitution.”

688,Martha McSally: The ‘Punk’ Senator Owes Journalist Apology,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/martha-mcsally-the-punk-senator-owes-journalist-apology/,"Manu Raju, CNN’s senior congressional correspondent, was simply going about his job last Thursday when he approached Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz) to inquire whether the Senate should consider new evidence as part of the impeachment trial.
Rather than provide a response one way or another, or even a curt “no comment,” McSally hurled an insult at Raju, calling him a “liberal hack,” adding, “I’m not talking to you.”
Thing is: Raju is anything but a liberal hack.
Raju is an accomplished and experienced reporter, who actually built much of his early career in print media.
Looking at his biography online, Raju’s first job in Washington DC was at Inside Washington Publishers, which told me all I needed to know.
Inside Washington Publishers takes entry-level journalists, and plugs them into business coverage beats for long hours at relatively low pay.
It’s a place for many apprentice journalists to practice their trade.
(Full disclosure: I never worked there myself but did work at a number of competing shops around town.)
Beyond that, Raju went on to write for name political publications like The Hill and Politico before finally going on air for CNN.
Raju is a consummate professional.
Thankfully, he has had so many stick up for him, from his CNN colleague Chris Cuomo, who called McSally “a punk” on air, to the National Press Club.
Joint statement issued by @PressClubDC & @NPCInstitute in support of @CNN‘s @mkraju: “Manu Raju is a consummate professional who is respected by his journalistic peers and the people he covers, politics notwithstanding. Stating the contrary is factually and ethically wrong.” pic.twitter.com/DjgxI9aVpy
— National Press Club (@PressClubDC) January 17, 2020
On the other side of this ugly encounter is Senator McSally.
A marginal congresswoman in Arizona, she first ran for Senate in 2018, for the seat opening up at the time by the retirement of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.)…. and she lost, to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.
But, like a political zombie, McSally came back. Arizona’s Republican governor appointed her to the unexpired term left in the state’s other Senate seat, remaining from the death of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz).
So now McSally is back, roaming the Halls of Congress, bringing embarrassment and shame to herself and the state she represents.
To say that McSally owes Raju an apology is obvious.
More than that, unfortunately, Arizona voters have to go to the polls one more time this November and reject McSally and the lack of ethics and manners she represents one more time.
We can only hope that this will be the last time.

689,More Reason for Optimism in the New Year: Bipartisan Congressional Modernization,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/more-reason-for-optimism-in-the-new-year-bipartisan-congressional-modernization/,"The other day we found some reason for optimism for our seemingly hopelessly divided nation in the unlikely campaign friendship of Democratic presidential rivals Andrew Yang and Cory Booker.
Today, we can find a little more in an obscure, but very bipartisan-spirited, effort to modernize the institution of Congress.
The initiative is led in rare true bipartisan fashion, almost in “buddy cop” form, by Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.) and Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.). Kilmer chairs, and Graves vice chairs, the very unsexy Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress.

Although their original mandate was nebulous — “develop recommendations on modernizing Congress” — over the last year, Kilmer and Graves have offered 45 unanimous recommendations to the full House. Those suggestions range from some basic cost-cutting by allowing for more bulk purchases instead of each office buying supplies to recommending more technical training for members and their staff.
A particularly bipartisan suggestion has been to have a bipartisan retreat for all House members and their families at the start of each new Congress, a very different situation than the current annual partisan retreats held outside Washington.
But, perhaps more importantly than any specifics, has been the overall civil, bipartisan and collaborative tone Kilmer, Graves and the other committee members have set.
“Their collaborative approach is as genuine as it is encouraging,” wrote the leaders of the Association of Former Members of Congress.
Rather than end the select committee at the close of this year, it was decided to extend it another year.

Not only can we wait to see what more it recommends, we can hope that it’s continued bipartisan and collegial spirit rubs off on the rest of the institution.

690,How the Government Creates Criminals,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/how-the-government-creates-criminals/,"There are criminals and there are criminals. Philosophers and theologians and social workers theorize about their origins; what makes a criminal? Are they all the same? Are some people just born larcenous and violent? Are they products of a hard world, reacting to circumstances beyond their control in the only way they can assert control? Nature or nurture; it’s an old argument and society has tried various ways to address it, with often ugly consequences for public policy and the citizens who have to live under it. There is one broad swath of criminals, however, that are definitely created. By the government. 

The government does this frequently. It is, after all, the literal job description of Congress to makes laws. Conservatives have long made the case that regulations breed a unique species of innocent criminals, harshly punished for crimes as innocuous as misplacing three fish. It is an oft-repeated statistic that the average American commits up to three felonies every day. But most Americans are not, and will never be, subject to these invasive and punitive laws (how many Americans will ever be in a position to misplace any fish?). However, Congress is about to turn millions of Americans into criminals, not some rare handful of libertarian anglers at the wrong place at the wrong time.
A fat-laden, must-pass, omnibus spending bill that Congress just sent to the president for approval was made a bit fatter as the last minute as a provision was added which will raise to 21 the minimum age for purchasing tobacco. Should Donald Trump sign this short-sighted bill, one morning next year millions of adults will walk into a convenience store or gas station with criminal intent. This is how the government creates criminals. 

Well, those people should quit anyway one might reasonably retort. Unfortunately, over 90 percent of them won’t. Only 3-5 percent of people successfully quit on their own. The vast majority of smokers will not be able to afford the professional cessation regimes and expensive pharmaceutical treatments necessary for a possible, but very unlikely, 55 percent success rate. Simple treatments like nicotine gum or the patch don’t get above 12 percent success rates. Raise the tobacco buying age to 21 and millions of Americans will become criminals because they aren’t stopping anytime soon. To top it off, just as tobacco taxes are highly regressive, banning the sale outright to a large segment of the user population will guarantee that the people most impacted will be in America’s most disadvantaged communities: the poor and minorities. 
But it’s illegal to buy tobacco for them now. That’s the whole point. How will they satisfy this forbidden craving? The same way people drank during prohibition, smoke weed where it’s still banned, and snort coke on Wall Street and in the Capitol. They’ll break the law and buy on the black market. The black market for tobacco has been thriving for years, raising the age of purchase is a giant gift to smugglers: Congress just made their most profitable and easy to traffic product even more valuable. 

Tobacco is the most heavily trafficked legal substance on Earth and upwards of $50 billion in global tax revenue is lost to cigarette smuggling every year. This is in very large measure because tobacco is often a country’s most highly taxed consumer good. Countries with higher taxes have higher rates of smuggling, a pattern mirrored in the US as shown in a 2015 study by the Tax Foundation. A 2018 report by the Seattle Times sums it up, “Cigarette smuggling robs Washington State of revenue.”
Obviously, more enforcement is needed so that states can stop hemorrhaging tax money; aggressive countermeasures to catch the scofflaws. Illinois has tried to address their tobacco tax avoidance problems with enhanced fines and jail time. Smuggling cigarettes in that state will net fines of $15 per pack up to 100 packs, getting caught with over 100 packs costs $25 per pack. Selling loosies, single cigarettes, is a $1,000 fine. For the first offense. The second offense is $3,000. And a felony. 

Of course, the people reduced to selling individual cigarettes are probably unlikely to be able to afford a $1,000 fine. This frequently results in poor people losing their jobs, and eventually their liberty. The high fines trap closes around them and lower-income offenders frequently find they are now prevented from accessing necessary public benefits and losing the right to vote or even custody of their children. Immigrants can expect to be deported, even if they have a green card. Whatever their job prospects were beforehand, a felony charge will leave the nefarious purveyor of loose cigarettes at a severe disadvantage in procuring legal employment. They’ll return to the black market to make a living. 
This is how the government creates a permanent class of criminals. 
If they’re lucky, the poor will be arrested – sometimes they just die. Enforcing tobacco tax law is what killed New Yorker Eric Garner, he was arrested for selling loosies in Staten Island when he was choked into submission and death by cops turned tax officers. Of course, poor people and minorities will bear the brunt of negative impacts by this legislation; more economically and historically disadvantaged will be punished for trying to buy tobacco because that’s who smokes the most. Congress has decided it’s okay to turn 90 percent of lower-class young smokers into criminals in the slim hope that 5 percent of them will quit. 

When the government creates one set of criminals, logistics requires yet more lawbreakers to make the black market work. And as this story from the Richmond Times Dispatch makes clear, where black markets reign, all manner of associated crime, including violence, follows. Selling black market tobacco can actually yield far higher profits than dealing cocaine, says William V. Pelfrey Jr., an associate professor of criminal justice at Virginia Commonwealth University’s Wilder School of Government, one of the rare American academics researching tobacco trafficking. “The related crimes are staggering,” says Pelfrey, and encompass everything from armed robbery to assault and possibly murder. Bans never affect just the substance or community that they’re targeting, they always end up covering the entire spectrum of crime. 

What good comes from turning millions of otherwise law-abiding, and already disadvantaged, adults into criminals? Is keeping a few tens of thousands of people from using tobacco worth adding millions, of mainly poor people, to our criminal justice system? America already incarcerates more people than any country on the planet and US law enforcement has a troubling record of inventing fake crimes to arrest people for; Congress should not be making it easier for innocent Americans to go to prison. At the very least, Americans deserve to know the possible consequences of this law. This omnibus bill was already stuffed to the gills with special interest protections and giveaways; hooking this tobacco provision in there as well is just shameful. The manner in which this bill passed is a perfect example of the dysfunction and deceit that is more and more becoming the operating principles of Washington D.C.  Americans deserve a debate on something that will send some of their children to prison and increase crime in their neighborhoods.
UPDATE: Trump has signed the bill into law. The Food and Drug Administration has 180 days to update its regulations.

691,"Rep. Biggs: Democrats, not Trump, are Abusing Power",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/congress/rep-biggs-democrats-not-trump-are-abusing-power/,"In a House Judiciary hearing, Republican House Representative Andy Biggs pushed back against the ongoing impeachment hearing, claiming that the Democrats were abusing their power, not Trump.
“Democrats have not only drawn different inferences from the fact, they have created facts to satisfy the obsession of their rage. It is a kind of mass hysteria, a cognitive dissonance, it’s an alternative reality they created. One colleague said if the president were innocent, he would come forward and bring documents, give us all the documents we want and everybody would come. To where? To this committee?”

“We can’t even get a fact witness in here. There’s no fact witness that comes in here. We get a law professor and staff asking staff questions. You want to go to Schiff’s bunker where he’s holding secret hearings, selectively leaking material that’s damaging to the president. Is that where you want him to come if he’s innocent? Yeah, bring it to us, we’ll scotch it. We’re going to blast it, we’re going to basically curb it and create the fact situation we want by misinterpreting everything you do.”
He slammed the apparent ignorance of facts from the Democrats, saying that the Democrats claim the president violated the law but they don’t have any evidence on which to base that claim.
“Well, here’s a for instance. They claim that the president publicly — he wanted a public announcement of investigations, but the only witness who said anything about that was a guy named Gordon Sondland, who admitted that no one on Earth told him that but he presumed it. He also said the only direct conversation he had with the president about these things was that the president said he wanted nothing from Ukraine except to clean up its corruption.”

He then continued to press that the president did not violate the law.
“The best evidence is the transcript between President Zelensky and President Trump. It shows no conditionality, no quid pro quo, no this for that. Aid was never even mentioned on the call. Subsequently, the president of Ukraine and various Ukrainian government physicals said there was no pressure, there were no conditions. The most recent statement was about a week ago from the president of Ukraine said it was fine, no pressure.”
These statements cames from a House Judiciary Committee meeting discussing the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. During the hearing, Rep. Biggs introduced an amendment to the articles saying that the withholding of aid was linked to making sure Ukrain was serious about anti-corruption laws

The amendment reads, “The aid was released within days of Ukrainian President Zelenskiy signing two major anti-corruption measures into law, convincing President Trump that the new Ukrainian administration was serious about reform measures and consistent with Administration policy to ensure foreign aid is not used for corrupt purposes.”
Biggs further explained:
“They [Democrats] claim that the only reason that President Trump released the aid was because the hold on aid became public. The fact of the matter is they produced no evidence on that but some timeline from which they drew some inferences. But, the stronger inference is — on the same day it was released, two important anti-corruption laws, the ending of immunity for Ukrainian legislators and reinstatement of a vigorous anti-corruption court.”

Finishing his statement off, he accused the Democrats of not really wanting to seek justice and abusing power.
“You don’t want to assert a remedy. You don’t want to go into court, you don’t want to negotiate with an executive branch. You want to hurry and impeachment. If you took this to court and wanted to find out, a court would say the privilege is bad, privilege is overly broad and would narrow the privilege. You don’t want that. You want impeachment. That’s all you want. And your case comes down to this, it rests on gossip, rumors, and innuendos. You don’t have direct evidence. The abuse of power is not by President Trump, it is by this body, who is trying to produce this preconceived, preordained result.”

The bill Bigg’s proposed did not pass the committee, which the Democrats hold a majority in.

692,It’s Time for Other Democrats To Follow Kamala Harris Out Of the Exits,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/its-time-for-other-democrats-to-follow-kamala-harris-out-of-the-exits/,"Faced with a financial picture darkening by the day, Sen. Kamala Harris did what what she had to, and end her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The truth is a reflection both on this year’s Democratic presidential field overall, and the Harris campaign in particular.
Even with the departure of Harris, 15 Democrats are left among the presidential contenders. That includes recent additions Deval Patrick and Michael Bloomberg.

This field remains way too crowded, and a number of hopefuls should do the honorable thing and follow the example of Harris.
These are good Democrats, who in another year, might have gained traction. But not this year. They are barely registering in the public opinion polls and frankly barely relevant to the national conversation.
This includes everyone from Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, to Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
Then there was Harris herself. A former California prosecutor and attorney general, she never seemed sure how much of her “tough on crime” resume to embrace, and how much to try to explain away.
Her biggest moment came when she challenged former vice president Joe Biden on racial issues. But then appeared to struggle when reporters asked her how her stance really differed from Biden’s.
The truth is that Harris has been a US senator, and therefore on the national stage, only since 2017.

Perhaps Harris will find better success on the road to the White House another year.

693,The US Space Program? It’s a Disgrace,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/the-us-space-program-its-a-disgrace/,"The United States used to be about big things: building huge dams to generate electricity, a complex interstate highway system to take us from here to there so much faster and maybe even more comfortably….and, yes, even going to the Moon.
What happened to all that, especially when it comes to exploring outer space?
Too often today, critics like to point out that unmanned probes can explore Mars efficiently and at less cost than with humans.
Strictly by the numbers, I suppose this is correct. But the same thing could have been said about the Moon.
But we still went there, nonetheless.
At the time, we had this outside driver, being competition with the Soviet Union.
We don’t have that today, although how embarrassing would it be if somewhere down the road the Chinese decide to make the trip ahead of us?
There ought to be a more compelling reason, and that is exploring our solar neighborhood ourselves just for the sake of it.
We ought to care both about the science to had, but also the grand sense of human adventure.
Unfortunately, our space program sort of hit a pinnacle with the International Space Station, but really has been fading ever since.
Americans can’t even reach orbit anymore without hitching a ride with the Russians. How humiliating.
And really the blame for this has been bipartisan. Whenever the need for grandiose speechifying about the future of US human spaceflight is called for, presidents of both parties have been adequately grandiose–as long as the heavy lifting, and the bill–all come due on the next guy’s watch.
And, no, the answer is not commercial spaceflight. President Kennedy didn’t contract off the moonshot to Boeing, and neither is going to Mars and beyond.
There are just some projects that are of national scope and national pride….too big to be taken on by one corporation and too big to be owned by one corporation.

694,Study: It’s Not Too Late to Fix Divided America,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/study-its-not-too-late-to-fix-divided-america/,"With the 2020 presidential election quickly approaching, politics in America are now more heated than ever. Research continues to highlight the deep divide between Democrats and Republicans over everything from policy measures to personal values and even tolerance of different opinions.

This divide doesn’t just live at the voting polls, though; it’s also a part of our relationships and conversations. To explore this further, AreaVibes surveyed over 1,000 Americans to understand how much they care about the people who live next door, particularly when their neighbors have different beliefs or backgrounds. And while they discovered that conservative Americans were the least likely to feel uncomfortable living next door to someone with a Confederate flag in their yard, right-leaning supporters were also more likely to feel accepted by their neighbors than liberal respondents. Here’s a more in-depth review of their findings.
When AreaVibes asked Americans who they feel the most uncomfortable living next to, an overwhelming majority (obviously) pointed to sex offenders (80%), followed by someone with a violent criminal record (70%) or who’d been arrested on drug charges (49%). While it was the least common response, 1 in 10 Americans said they were uncomfortable living next door to someone from the Middle East.

Despite the fact that there are over 350 languages spoken in the U.S., older Americans were the most likely to feel uncomfortable with neighbors who have a language barrier. About 1 in 3 baby boomers, over 1 in 4 Gen Xers, and around 1 in 5 millennials said non-English-speaking people in their communities made them uncomfortable. White (28%) and Black or African American (27%) survey respondents were more likely than Hispanic people and Asian Americans to feel this discomfort. Bias against non-English-speaking neighbors was also highest among right-leaning Americans (45%).
For some people, animosity toward neighbors is directed more toward their beliefs than race or nationality. Sixty percent of millennials said they would not move next door to someone who kept a Confederate flag in their yard, a higher response than from either Gen Xers (57%) and baby boomers (46%). Compared to almost 73% of left-leaning respondents who refused to live next to someone with a Confederate flag on display, just 38% of conservative voters said the same.

AreaVibes also found that 72% of Americans had visited prospective neighborhoods to assess the community. White respondents were more likely to live in communities of the same race or ethnicity than any other group surveyed.
Despite their concerns, the majority of Americans across all generations surveyed acknowledged feeling accepted by the neighbors. With this in mind, America may still have the ability to sew itself back together even though the current political climate may imply otherwise.

695,Andrew Yang’s UBI Could Be Illegal,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/justice/andrew-yangs-ubi-could-be-illegal/,"Andrew Yang went from being ignored by major media sites to one of the most talked-about presidential candidates running in 2020. An entrepreneur concerned about the “4th industrial revolution” (read: machines taking over our jobs), Yang built his campaign around his Freedom Dividend (Universal Basic Income) that gives everyone over 18 $1000 a month.

Purportedly, the $1000 a month would, “provide money to cover the basics for Americans while enabling us to look for a better job, start our own business, go back to school, take care of our loved ones or work towards our next opportunity.” Funded by a value-added tax, the money would work towards helping people sustain themselves while they pursue other things that they want in life.
The fundamental idea of universal basic income may or may not be the right idea, but more importantly, UBI could be unconstitutional.
The tenth amendment of the Constitution says, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
Under the tenth amendment, any power not granted to the three branches of the government and not prohibited to the States are up to the States to implement. In other words, Congress can’t make laws regarding things it wasn’t specifically designated to govern.

Congress’s powers are granted under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. Specifically, Congress may, “…lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States,” among many other things.
In order for Yang to implement his Freedom Dividend, he would have to get Congressional approval. However, under the tenth amendment, Congress doesn’t have the power to impose taxes to fund the Freedom Dividend, nor does it have the ability to distribute it.
On its face, it seems like Section 8 is granting Congress the power to use tax money and distribute the Freedom Dividend (“general Welfare of the United States”).
However, Paul Engel from The Constitution Study writes, “There are three nouns used in the Constitution to designate the possessor of powers and over whom they can and cannot be applied: the United States, the States, and the People.  The term ‘United States’ refers to the union of states and its government.  The term ‘States’ or ‘Several States’ refers to the states either individually or collectively.  And ‘The People’ refers to individuals.”

In this case, the general welfare clause refers to the “United States.” If Congress were to enact a UBI bill, it would be for the welfare of “the People” not “the United States” since universal basic income benefits individual people, not the United States collectively.
While the Constitution is written very broadly and open for lots of interpretations, Paul also offers the reasoning behind why “general welfare of the United States” doesn’t apply in this case:
“…the United States of America is the name given to the union of states.  (Think of a corporation created by stockholders.). Today we tend to think of states as a subdivision of the federal government, but it is, in fact, the other way around.  The United States is a creation of the states to which they have delegated some of their powers.  In this context, the states have delegated to Congress the power to collect taxes for a limited number of things, common defense and general welfare of the union itself.  As James Madison put it, that is a general power.  The rest of Article I, Section 8 are the specific powers that make up the common defense and general welfare for the union.  So things like Foreign commerce, coining money, creating federal courts, establishing post roads, raising armies, etc. are the things Congress can collect taxes for since they are for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.  They are not for the welfare of the states themselves or for the people of those states. “

“If the General Welfare Clause gave Congress the power to do anything they could somehow identify as in the general welfare of the people or the states of the United States, then the vast majority of the Constitution, along with the idea of a limited federal government, would be effectively void.  Why create a list of powers if they are already included in the term “for the General Welfare”?  This is confirmed by James Madison in Federalist Papers #41:
“It has been urged and echoed, that the power “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,” amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare […] For what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted, if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power? Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars.
— Federalist Papers #41
If giving out UBI isn’t an enumerated power given to Congress under the Constitution, then by the 10th amendment, Congress giving out UBI is unconstitutional and thereby illegal. After all, the United States was founded on the belief of a limited federal government, hence why any power not delegated in the Constitution is reserved for the States unless specifically prohibited, in which case the People hold them.

Indeed, even though UBI could be illegal, it wouldn’t be the first. Article I, Section 8 has been one of the most hotly debated parts of the Constitution, and possibly even largely ignored. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson both agreed that the general welfare clause referred to the power enumerated to Congress later on in the Constitution (to pay debts, to provide defense, etc), while Alexander Hamilton advocated for a much broader view, expressing that the clause granted Congress the power to spend, as long as it was for the general welfare of the federal government.
Supreme Court Justice Story sided with the Hamiltonian view in United States V. Butler, writing that Section 8 granted Congress to spend as long as it was for the general welfare of the federal government. Regardless though, UBI would qualify as the general welfare of “the People” not the federal government.
And yes, that means most of the federal welfare programs are illegal too, but that’s for another day.

696,Banning Vapes is Stupid and Irrational,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/banning-vapes-is-stupid-and-irrational/,"With the discovery of a new lung disease, possibly being linked to vaping, lawmakers, Trump included, were quick to act and bring up the idea of banning the sale of all flavored vaping devices. However, this is more of a case of mass hysteria than anything.
Banning the sale of vapes while no specific cause of the disease has been identified is a very irrational thing to do. Instead of waiting for toxicology reports to roll in or a scientific link between vaping and the disease, lawmakers are panicking and simply want to just ban vapes outright.

Now, I’m not saying vaping is good. I strongly oppose all form of smoking. However, it being bad doesn’t justify a ban. Do we ban junk food because it makes us fat? Or do we ban wine because it makes people drunkards? No. When people buy vapes and cigarettes, they should be doing so with the knowledge that smoking and vaping is very harmful. They smoke at their own expense.
Admittedly, the industry is doing a horrible job of educating users. That alone, though, doesn’t justify a ban. Now, if vaping did cause the lung disease, sure, go ahead and ban it. The problem here is, it has not been proven yet. Everyone is jumping to conclusions without considering what facts are available. For all we know, the disease could be caused by some other substance that vape users also tend to use.
As Beverly Friedmann from ReviewingThis puts it, “In my opinion, it would be a rash decision and perhaps a bit overzealous to ban all flavored vaping products at this juncture, despite the recent illnesses in question. While we’ve all heard about the recent illnesses and even deaths correlated to specific vaping products, none of them have been specifically traced back to nicotine or even non-nicotine (flavored) products alone. We also have to give careful consideration to the number of people who have successfully quit smoking via the use of vaping products and continue to abstain via use.
The use of traditional cigarette products, containing thousands of harmful chemicals, is linked to millions of deaths and continues to be legal. While two wrongs never make a right, we often have to ask ourselves to question both media sensationalism as well as the lesser of two evils. While there is not an argument to make for vaping being healthy, we also have to ask ourselves how many people would return to smoking with an FDA ban on all products. Thus it seems both premature and unjust to adult users for the government to ban the use of all vaping products without further conclusive research and studies to support this action.”

As for the people up in Washington wanting to enact a ban, they simply want to jump on a sailing boat. That is, if it turns out that vaping does indeed cause the disease, they will be praised for their quick action. If it turns out it doesn’t, they can point out they were being cautious and did something responsible in the face of a dire problem.
A year from now, when Trump seeks reelection, he’ll look back and say, “Look at the vaping epidemic. I was there to stop it. People were dying fast. Very fast, I tell you. I helped Congress pass a ban and saved very many lives. I know how to handle a pressing emergency. Vote for me!”
That’s just the problem. This media’s over-reporting has made the issue seem like a world catastrophe. Lawmakers have been influenced and some believe that it really is a dire catastrophe that requires executive action to solve.
And remember, it hasn’t even been proven that vaping actually causes the disease.
Dr. Nikola Djordjevic from MedAlertHelp.org says, “…there is a bit of mass-hysteria going on regarding the vaping scare. There have been cases of contaminated water and food causing illness, and generally, the products are recalled and customers are alerted. Since in the vaping industry there are many companies, each producing their own line of vaping oil, I think a full-ban by the FDA is a bit excessive.

So it’s possible that a particular batch of vaping oil was contaminated, and that company should be investigated and blacklisted until it’s sorted. People are vaping in North America and most of Europe for many years now, and there haven’t been similar cases like this one. So I think before we start panicking it’s best to wait out and see what kind of data is produced by the toxicology reports before justifying a nation-wide ban on a product.”
Once again. Mass hysteria. Sensationalism. Panic. Chaos. “Ban vapes now and think about the consequences later!”
Until vaping has actually been linked with this epidemic, a ban is unjustified. Now, thats not saying vape users shouldn’t be wary and hold off use, just that its not the government’s job to get involved. Yet.

697,The Brexit Will Tear the United Kingdom Apart,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-brexit-will-tear-the-united-kingdom-apart/,"I confess that, while I was never really on board with Brexit, the breathless warnings from the pro-EU camp were enough to push me into the pro-Brexit side. I thought that the Remainers’, rather condescending, argument boiled down to little more than “PANIC! Without the EU, Britain will fall into the sea!” I am no great fan of the tremendously elitist European Union either and also thought the Leavers’, similarly condescending, argument amounted to little more than “Brussels is the 4th Reich and we must resist now or lose our identity as Britons!” At the end of the day, I argued, Great Britain will do just fine whether or not she is a member of the European Union. There is too much money to be made on both sides of the Channel, too many financial and cultural threads connecting the United Kingdom and Europe, for a real, permanent disruption. The people voted, I said, quit the fear-mongering and get it over with: whatever the hell you’re going to do, just do it so everyone can get on with their businesses and their lives. 
I’ve changed my mind. Brexit is a terrible idea and a new referendum is more than justified and prudent, it is absolutely necessary. 

I misunderstood the nature of the Brexit risk. The EU is not the union I should’ve been watching. I understood the problems posed by the Irish border, and even that reunification of Ireland with Northern Ireland was becoming more of a political possibility. What took me by surprise was how seriously Scots are discussing independence. Splitting from Europe now means the potential dissolution of Britain itself. 
The EU has for 20 years been an overly bureaucratic organization, with remarkable disregard for the local political and cultural challenges of member states. But it is also a demonstrably effective organization when it comes to helping out the smaller states. My home of Malta has grown more in the fifteen years since joining the European Union than it had almost in the four decades since independence from Britain. I barely recognize some parts of the island; so much development, so much investment, so many people living and working there from all over the continent and world. I love it.

But I lived in Germany during the EU transition, I remember the cleaning we got during the Deutsche Mark to Euro changeover. We called it the Teuero (teuer is German for expensive). The Euro was supposed to be exactly twice the value of the Mark, what cost 2 DM should now cost 1 Euro. Instead what we got was a bunch of storekeepers (especially gas stations, restaurants, and supermarkets) just changing the DM sign to Euro, effectively doubling the price. German politicians took way too long to acknowledge it was happening and never held the EU to account for the inflation obvious to everyone except economists in Berlin and bureaucrats in Brussels. Ever since I’ve had a love/hate relationship with the EU. I understand why Brexit happened.
Even with my misgivings on Brexit I found the the apocalyptic Remainer rhetoric distasteful. Britain has been around for centuries, she is integral to the global economy, her culture is one of the most recognizable, loved, and marketable the world has ever seen. Britain’s economy may lag a bit (probably lag a lot) for a while but she’ll emerge just fine. There’s too much money to be made in and with the United Kingdom for any economic slump to be anything but temporary.
However, I now think that Brexit is not merely a bad idea but is a phenomenally, unprecedentedly, historically bad idea. I didn’t understand the threat. Brexit can end three hundred years of a united Britain and that is unacceptable for this Anglophile and Commonwealth citizen (I know, not technically a thing but it’s how I feel).
Scotland is quite ready to tell the rest of Britain to piss right off. I didn’t get that. I didn’t understand that the Scottish independence referendum five years ago failed largely because remaining British was thought to be the only way to stay in the EU. 

I was in Scotland last month for the Fringe Festival (if you haven’t been you’re missing out. I’m already planning to be there again next year.) and I’ve since been reading up. The Scots are fed up and willing to go it alone. They’re ready to join a different union as an independent nation and are preparing for a second independence referendum. The Scottish conservative party is in disarray and London can in no way count on their support in such a referendum. 
And that should be scary to anyone with a love for Britain. I don’t want the Kingdom to no longer be United. Not being part of the EU will cause temporary economic problems in GB, definitely. Which is nothing compared to the lasting cultural, political, military, and economic consequences of a less great Great Britain. The Kingdom has been United since 1707. Risking that is insane.

I have few real doubts that Scotland would do just fine by itself. I have few real doubts that what remains of Great Britain wouldn’t eventually also do just fine. But I don’t want Scotland out, I don’t want the Union Jack to have to be redesigned: I don’t want one of the most influential political institutions in human history to dissolve over something as silly as this.
The Remainers stoked a bunch of unnecessary fear about how poor Britain would become without the EU, which was bollocks. But the Leavers are bullshitting everyone now about what else may happen. If there is any chance at all that Britain will fracture and weaken itself (make no mistake, Scotland leaving will make Britain weaker for years to come) then they should reject Brexit.

698,Will Joe Biden Utimately Destroy His Own Campaign?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/joe-biden-his-gaffes-and-staying-power/,"Former vice president Joe Biden has long been known as “Uncle Joe” for his propensity for verbal gaffes.
Now that he’s running for president, Biden’s penchant for gaffe-making has become an increasing focus for the press.
So much so that while some party activists and even some in the press are ready to write Biden off completely, the Democratic front-runner’s poll numbers have remained durable.

“You can tell that he’s a very highly intelligent person who thinks rationally,” said Tim Weil, a 66-year-old farmer from early-decision state Iowa. “It’s just a quirk that he’s prone to slip-ups like that. It’s not a big deal.”
There’s a contrary view emerging in the press, including among those who don’t count themselves among Biden’s biggest fans, who also argue that the gaffe criticisms are a) unfair and b) don’t fairly reflect anything about Biden’s age given that he’s been making these same sort of gaffes for decades in the public eye.
The truth is that there are more Democratic presidential debates to come and further opportunities to see whether these gaffes really would affect a Biden presidency.

699,Trump has Moved On…to Posting Fake Weather,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/from-fake-news-to-fake-weather/,"The president who introduced the world to “fake news” has branched out in a whole new level of inanity and dishonesty by delivering fake weather from the Oval Office.
In what can only be described as bizarre, Donald Trump held up a forecast map for Hurricane Dorian, except that it had been clearly altered by what appeared to be a Sharpie marker to expand the storm track to include Alabama, where it was never forecast to hit.

Still, Trump refused to concede the point, insisting that Alabama had been under potential threat by Dorian.
It’s just such an odd point to make such a fuss over.
Yes, we know Alabama is an important part of the Trump base. But what’s so absolutely crazy here is whether or not the state may or may not have been hit by natural disaster won’t appreciably effect his political standing one way or another.
If Trump wants to hold a rally in Alabama, he doesn’t need a hurricane, or potential hurricane, as an excuse.
However, his fake weather map is just so obvious, it only serves to further expose Trump’s dishonesty and duplicity.
However, considering that exposing Trump for the liar and con artist ahead of the election would be a good thing, perhaps they should start having him do the forecast daily on “News at 6.”
Oh, and here’s another one for the articles of impeachment: Altering official government weather forecasts isn’t just a cause for concern — it’s illegal.

700,What Impact Has the #MeToo Movement Had on Sex Education Legislation?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/what-impact-has-the-metoo-movement-had-on-sex-education-legislation/,"People are beginning to rethink the fundamental attitudes once commonly held about relationships and consent. The #MeToo movement has made waves across society, and one place where it has been influential is in sex education legislation. Although social values have long played a role in many states’ legislation, the rise of #MeToo has made a significant impact and caused legislators to reconsider their approach.
Several states have introduced new legislation since 2016. Missouri, New Jersey, and California adopted legislation addressing sexually inappropriate behavior online. Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, and Colorado, while keeping sex education optional, now require a discussion about healthy relationships or sexual consent.

Nine states and the District of Columbia require discussion of consent, and there is growing support for consent discussion to be mandatory everywhere. Opponents of required consent discussion have expressed concern that this encourages sexual behavior. Many feel that it is difficult to find a middle ground between these two positions.
State laws about sex education have often avoided discussion about consent. In many locations, education still focuses on abstinence. Appropriate education regarding sexual information protects people from abuse by helping them discern between healthy and unhealthy behaviors.
The #MeToo movement has had a significant influence on schools’ sex education. Positive results have included students being given a broader education in what constitutes inappropriate behavior and learning to discern when someone has gone too far. Adverse effects include the possibility of someone raising false accusations based on their understanding of the law.
Even though the #MeToo movement has focused mainly on heterosexual assault, many in the LGBTQ community have also encountered problems with sexual harassment or assault. However, some states and individual school districts ignore this group in their sex education curriculum. Others might affirm LGBTQ relationships but still focus most of their education on abuses in heterosexual relationships.

In the aftermath of the #MeToo movement, many young people are standing up and acknowledging that teaching about consent and other issues is essential, regardless of sexual orientation. The teenage years are among the most difficult for many, and LGBTQ youth are no exception. If teens feel more empowered, they are less likely to feel stigmatized when they come forward about abuse and harassment.
The way sex education legislation is being approached is just one of the things that have been impacted. Sex education for teens has seen some changes in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and further changes will likely continue as the movement’s influence increases.

701,"If Carbon Offsets Require Forests to Stay Standing, What Happens When the Amazon Is on Fire?",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/if-carbon-offsets-require-forests-to-stay-standing-what-happens-when-the-amazon-is-on-fire/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
Next month, California regulators will decide whether to support a plan for tropical forest carbon offsets, a controversial measure that could allow companies like Chevron, which is headquartered there, to write off some of their greenhouse gas emissions by paying people in countries like Brazil to preserve trees. The Amazon rainforest has long been viewed as a natural testing ground for this proposed Tropical Forest Standard, which, if approved, would likely expand to countries throughout the world.
Now that record fires are engulfing the Amazon, started by humans seeking to log, mine and farm on the land, supporters are using the international emergency to double down on their case for offsets. The Environmental Defense Fund posted a petition urging that state officials endorse the standard: “The people — and wildlife — who call the Amazon home are running for their lives,” it said. “The entire world is counting on [the board] taking action.” Ivaneide Bandeira Cardozo, who helped manage a Brazilian offset project that was derailed by illegal logging, said, “People who are against carbon credits are not suffering and don’t want to keep the forest standing.”


But the devastating blaze encapsulates a key weakness of offsets that scientists have been warning about for the past decade: that they are too vulnerable to political whims and disasters like wildfires. As a recent ProPublica investigation noted, if you give corporations a pass to pollute by saying their emissions are being canceled out somewhere else, you need a way to guarantee that continues to be the case.
Because carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for about 100 years, protected forests must remain intact for a century to offset the pollution; this requirement is written into the Tropical Forest Standard. That plan can go up in smoke the moment a country elects a president like Jair Bolsonaro, who took office in Brazil in January and de-funded environmental agencies, cut back on enforcement and encouraged the clearing of the Amazon for beef and soy production. Indigenous communities who live in the Amazon report a surge of intruders mining and logging on their land.
People have always exploited the forest illegally, “but in the last few months, it has increased significantly,” said Camões Boaventura, a federal prosecutor in the Brazilian state of Pará. Meanwhile, he said, environmental officials are struggling to pay for the gas they need to drive around enforcing regulations. Gisele Bleggi, a federal prosecutor in Rondônia, said Bolsonaro didn’t have to change a single environmental law to encourage deforestation. “Once you stop giving money for surveillance … the system it protects will collapse.”
One of the biggest sources of funding for the rainforest, the Amazon Fund, was suspended after Norway and Germany withdrew support worth $72 million. The fund has provided more than $1 billion over the past decade and is contingent on minimizing deforestation, but it doesn’t provide offsets that allow others to pollute. The countries suspended their payments amid a recent spike in deforestation and after Bolsonaro interfered with how the money would be used. In early August, Bolsonaro fired the head of the space agency after it released data showing rising deforestation.
The Amazon fires also showcase a second hurdle in making offsets work: For them to be a valid reflection of how much pollution is being canceled out, the math needs to be accurate. This accounting is especially hard to do after wildfires, because they stifle a forest’s regrowth far more than previously estimated. Scientists are just starting to understand this impact, which is hard to quantify and has led the Amazon’s carbon content to be overestimated, creating the potential to give offsets more credit than they’re worth.


This month, California state Sen. Bob Wieckowski urged the state’s Air Resources Board to reject the Tropical Forest Standard because it “risks producing a landslide of false credits.” His letter referenced ProPublica’s reporting and academic research that cited the challenges of ensuring credits are real. His letter followed an earlier one from California lawmakers who cautiously supported the standard but told the board to exercise “vigorous and proactive monitoring” to ensure offsets are valid.
Jeff Conant, who directs the international forests program at the advocacy group Friends of the Earth, said Brazil absolutely “should receive some money from the global north,” but not as offsets that give companies a “loophole” to continue emitting carbon. Conant said the offsets debate has been “a distraction” from what he considers the real solution: strong regulations and keeping fossil fuels in the ground. “We’ve been saying for over a decade that we need regulation, we need demand-side measures, we need to take responsibility for our own consumption up here in the north,” he said.
Both the Environmental Defense Fund and Conant support a California assembly bill designed to ensure the state government doesn’t buy paper, furniture or other forest products made from deforestation in the tropics. Companies with state contracts would need to certify that their products didn’t destroy sensitive ecosystems like the Amazon.
In Brazil, experts widely credit regulations as the driving force that brought deforestation to a record low in 2012; then, the federal government relaxed its stringent rules and enforcement, and it began to creep up, years before Bolsonaro took office. Brazil is “going backwards in the bigger picture,” said Matthew Hansen, a satellite and mapping expert at the University of Maryland. “I think that’s the bigger story.”
The wildfires have worsened fears that the Amazon is being pushed toward a tipping point where it will turn into a savanna, with devastating consequences for climate change and ecosystems. Luiz Aragão, who heads the remote sensing division at Brazil’s space agency, said 2019 has seen the highest number of fires since 2010, and it’s just the start of the fire season, which ends in November. He said the human-set fires — which were almost all started on agricultural or newly cleared land — will spread into healthy, intact areas of the rainforest, and it will take time to figure out how much of the forest is burned. There are no reports yet that any of the offset projects located in the Amazon are on fire.


Many supporters of offsets, including Cardozo, who runs an indigenous rights organization in Rondônia, also support more traditional conservation aid like the Amazon Fund, but they say offsets are necessary because rich countries aren’t willing to provide enough funding to preserve forests without getting something in return.
As global leaders discussed the Amazon over the weekend at the G7 meeting and pledged $22 million to help fight the fires, prosecutors in Brazil are eyeing measures they can take even in the face of a hostile presidential administration. Boaventura, who works for the Public Ministry, a powerful independent federal agency, said his team is investigating the role that Bolsonaro and national environmental agencies have had on increasing deforestation and fires.
“Once this link is proven, we want to hold the agencies and authorities that justified this destructive action against society accountable,” Boaventura said.

702,"Prager Calls 2020 Democrats ‘Fraud,’ ‘Liar,’ ‘Slime’",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/prager-calls-2020-democrats-fraud-liar-slime/,"On his radio show, conservative Dennis Prager called out the Democratic candidates as, “frauds,” “liars,” as well other various insults.

He aimed his comments mainly at Beto O’Rourke, saying that he’s a “slime. When he speaks, I wish to throw up,” as well as Pete Buttigieg, mocking him by saying, “He’s a total fraud. Oh, look, I was in the military. I’m clean-cut, but I want to abolish the Electoral College. I, Buttigieg, at 35, know better how America should be run than the founders of the country, because I’m an arrogant SOB, that’s why. They’re all arrogant. What did the founders know? Oh, Electoral College! We don’t want that! We want a direct vote for president.”
He also attacked Democratic debate speakers, saying, “They stink as people. They don’t just stink as Democrats. They stink as human beings. They lie with the ease with which you breathe.”
He then adds, “These are not good people. I wish I didn’t believe that.  I wish they were just good people I differed with.”
He went on to attack leftist in general, saying that, “almost every leftist is a mean human being.”

During the show, he then pushed conservative beliefs, saying, “I beg people to get my Rational Bible, These are the things that I teach — it says to love your neighbor as yourself. It doesn’t say love the whole world as yourself. It doesn’t say love everyone as yourself.”
As for his answer on making a better society, Prager says, “to make a better society is get married and make a good family and join a church and treat your neighbors well. That’s our answer. Their answer is fundamentally transform the United States of America.”

703,Why the Sanders Candidacy is No Longer Viable,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/why-the-sanders-candidacy-is-no-longer-viable/,"Before the first presidential debate between Senator John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard M. Nixon, the talk on the street was that Nixon was going to mop the floor with JFK. Nixon had a long career in Congress, he exposed Alger Hiss’ espionage plot and had served as VP to Eisenhower, one of the most popular presidents of the previous 50 years. JFK was a one-term senator with an unremarkable record.
But this was the first televised presidential debate, and the rules were about to change. 

While the radio audience rated the debate a tie, based on the substance of the mens’ words, the TV audience overwhelmingly favored Kennedy. He looked strong, staring right into the camera with each answer. Nixon, pale from being indoors, looked frail. Not knowing much about emerging TV etiquette, his eyes shifted away from the camera during the debate. The final nail in the coffin was Nixon’s famous 5 O’clock shadow. They used a little makeup to cover the stubble, but it melted under the hot lights, making Nixon look sickly and sweaty, uncomfortable and awkward. 
It was the dawn of the television presidency, and the nation never looked back.
Today, presidents and candidates appear on late night talk shows and even online series. They are guests on podcasts, and often appear to enjoy yukking it up with comedians who impersonate them on shows like Saturday Night Live. It’s standard operating procedure, but familiarity breeds contempt. 

The candidacy of Bernie Sanders hit a glass ceiling in 2016, and never recovered. While he’s still plenty popular, he still can’t seem to climb to the top of the polls, no matter the field or the timeframe. And there is a very big reason for that. The TV presidency has matured, and the nuance and context of how shows like SNL lampoon politicians has accidentally slain its first dragon. It has maimed the Sanders campaign, inflicting a wound from which it will not recover.
Sanders’ viability as a candidate ended the moment Larry David portrayed him on SNL. That was it. 
And it’s not because he made fun of him. It’s not because the portrayal was critical of him. It wasn’t because the jokes were “too” funny.  It’s because SNL turned Sanders’ authenticity into the punchline. Love him or hate him, Sanders is no faker. What you see is what you get. His authenticity is what helped him emerge from the pack back in 2015, giving Hilary Clinton a serious run for her money in the primaries. Many argue that back-room Democratic Party maneuvering kept Sanders from the nomination, but it was far more than that. SNL mocked Bernie not for being corrupt or fake or two-faced or mean. They mocked Bernie for being Bernie.
Look at the history of it. When comedians mock politicians, they usually mock the “act” politicians put on for the crowd.

Kate McKinnon portrayed Hillary as publicly affable and privately ruthless, which may very well be true, but it was still a fiction. They mocked Ronald Reagan on SNL by portraying him as publicly feeble and privately sharp as a tack. Essentially, they called him an idiot by making fun of the idea of his being smart. They mocked Gerald Ford with pratfalls, portraying him as clumsy, because Ford’s personality was so devoid of energy, they had to make up something funnier than the actual guy.  And Nixon? Well, he was his own punchline, uttering Sock it to Me on Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In in a manner so laughably awkward, even Rich Little’s impersonation of him wasn’t as funny as the real thing..
In other words, their deficiencies were the source of the comedy. With Sanders, they turned the primary source of his appeal — his refusal to soften himself for the cameras —  into the joke itself. I am not sure he even realizes it himself, but when the source of a politician’s strength becomes a popular punchline, it forever colors how voters in the era of politics-as-reality-TV perceive them. When they see Bernie, they don’t see Bernie. They see Larry David, who many TV critics argued was better at being Bernie than Bernie is.
It may feel imperceptible, but when voters can no longer hear the presidential voice in a candidate, it turns the candidate into a friend, a buddy, someone they can respect and appreciate, but they’ll never vote for him. SNL did not offer a cartoon portrayal of the man. They made the man into the cartoon.

Unfortunately, Sanders has been done for quite some time. It’s time for him to realize that, because if he waits for the voters to tell him, the results could be frightening and tragic.

704,July CNN Democratic Presidential Debate Night 2,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/july-cnn-democratic-presidential-debate-night-2/,"The second Democratic debate is officially over, and I have to say that last night was a huge surprise, but also a huge disappointment. Candidates that last time failed to deliver were some of the leaders, and some of the expected frontrunners stumbled, and nearly fell. Here’s an analysis of the second Democratic debate.
Tulsi Gabbard: A-
Gabbard, in my opinion was one of the best of the night, but she triumphed over a field that was, honestly, not so impressive. As the debate devolved into attacks on Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, Gabbard took her shot at Harris, then stepped back and promoted her own unique qualities. She appeared concerned and motivated, but not mean. While I’m certainly not 100 percent in agreement with her, Gabbard was really the only lower-tier candidate able to successfully use this debate as a way to strengthen her identity, rather than fading into the crowd.
Cory Booker: B+
Compared to the last debate, Booker was definitely most improved. He took aim at Joe Biden for his stance on crime, and past support of crime bills, while carving out his own niche as one of the top candidates on criminal justice. I’m not sure if Booker’s performance last night can completely overcome his abysmal performance in the previous debate, though, as first impressions are important. Booker may end up being seen as merely a foil to Biden instead of a strong candidate in his own right, keeping him out of the A range. He also failed to adequately put down criticisms of his own record, and in my opinion, fell into the trap of criticizing others (Trump and Biden) more than he should have. 

Jay Inslee: B+
Jay Inslee remains one of my favorite candidates because of his positions on my key issues, but while he defended those issues well, he remains a one-note candidate. It almost feels as though Jay Inslee is running for president to raise awareness about the environment, rather than to govern. He’s more versatile than someone like Yang by far, and overall put on a good showing at the debate, but misses the A range by continuing to be marginalized as a lower-tier one issue candidate. Inslee had a solid performance, and has distinguished himself as unique, but for the non-greenies out there, remains a lukewarm choice.
Bill DeBlasio: B
DeBlasio was more substantive this time, and successfully undermined Joe Biden as America’s favorite. He did make remarks meant to showcase his record, but still has at least one major scandal to grapple with: the death of Eric Garner. This is quite obviously troubling, as even as a low-tier candidate, DeBlasio was called out on his record. So, while he did fine last night, if he rises in favor as a potential nominee, he’ll need to learn to handle personal criticisms on his record in New York, as well or better than he did DeBlasio has been all offense, all the time. This is working for him, but he can only rise so far before he’s forced to play defense too, as we saw last night.  
Michael Bennet: B-
Another day, another Western moderate. Michael Bennet is eerily similar to John Hickenlooper, and to an extent, Steve Bullock, and last night didn’t really change that perception. While he served as a good foil to Medicare for All, and certainly handled the immigration questions the best of all the moderates, Bennet’s substance is forgettable. With this many candidates in the race, it’s absolutely critical for low-tier candidates to be unique and convince voters why to vote for them specifically, rather than just why not to vote for Sanders or Biden. Bennet didn’t make any mistakes, but I feel like all I know is what he doesn’t believe in, not what he does.
Andrew Yang: B-
Of the unqualified candidates in the race, Yang is by far the strongest and the smartest. However, he can never really rise above the “slightly above average” level of B-. Why not? Well, what if that “1,000 dollars for every American” doesn’t get through Congress? Without universal basic income (UBI), who is Andrew Yang? Every time he spoke, every question, it could be solved by “1,000 dollars for every American.” Don’t think UBI is the dream deal? There goes Yang. A candidate needs to be more than one policy, particularly when that candidate has no experience of implementing said policy anywhere but in his mind. I like Yang. I think he’s smart, and could absolutely have a future in politics, just not as president, and certainly not with only one idea. I wanted him off the stage last time, and I still do. 
Kamala Harris: C+
Oof. Kamala Harris, I had such high hopes for you. Harris didn’t do extremely badly, per se, but compared to her last debate, she bombed hard. When asked to pay for her plans (something the moderators should really ask about more), or severely criticized on her record, she dodged the questions. Tulsi Gabbard aggressively rebuked Harris for her zeal as a prosecutor, which Harris only answered in regards to the death penalty, not in regards to incarceration. This goes against the entire image Harris has tried to paint for herself as a candidate, and so she now is in danger of falling into the trap of being hypocritical and simply a passionate mouthpiece rather than a serious candidate. Harris certainly has made good plans, and she is still as assertive as ever, but without the substance to back her up, she risks being seen as all talk and no substance. We’ll have to see in the next debate how Harris handles attacks, because the attacks will keep coming.

Kirsten Gillibrand: C
Gillibrand also falls into the unfortunate “snoozefest” category that has crippled so many of the lower-tier candidates. If Gillibrand had the support of, say, Harris or Pete Buttigieg, she would have done fine. Sadly, she doesn’t. I don’t think there’s anything that Kirsten Gillibrand said last night that was any different from what she said in June. There’s no reason to support her now that there wasn’t then. 
Julian Castro: C
Castro was like Gillibrand, solidly average. In a traditional grading system, C is reserved for students that meet the requirements of the assignment and stop there. Like Gillibrand, in today’s grade inflated classrooms, he’d get an A, but in a field of 20, he does not. His revolutionary idea to decriminalize immigration? Oops, everyone else jumped on that idea already. He got shut out of most of the major discussions, and allowed candidates like Harris to steal his thunder. If Castro wants to stay in, he’s got an uphill battle.
Joe Biden: D+
Last but not least, we have our dear Uncle Joe. Outside of the debate arena, Biden is pretty cool. Inside, he got creamed. Biden’s biggest talking point has been that he is the continuation of President Barack Obama. If we liked something about Obama, we’ll like it about Biden. That approach has taken him far, but as we all knew would happen, put him to the fire when Obama was criticized. When Biden was criticized for Obama’s deportations, he punted, insisting it wasn’t his call. Cory Booker then correctly pointed out that Biden has tried to have it both ways with Obama, a big hit that has the potential to sink Joe Biden. He appeared last night, as a relic of the past: someone who clings onto unpopular positions not because he believes in them, but because his whole campaign depends on his connection to Obama. Add on Biden’s age, and he appears as too old and out of touch. Biden was unprepared to be grilled by DeBlasio on his support for “tough on crime” policy, another area where he’s almost forced into silence or hypocrisy. Uncle Joe may be leading, but another bad debate like this could really put him under.

705,How Border Security Could Determine the Outcome of 2020,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/election/how-border-security-could-determine-the-outcome-of-2020/,"While the economy, welfare, and foreign policy are the main fault lines along which elections are generally fought, border security was at the forefront in the 2016 elections. The terms border security and immigration are often used interchangeably in mainstream political discourse. Donald Trump famously made headlines in the run-up to the previous election regarding Mexico funding a wall along the US southern border to keep out Mexican immigrants. He promised to build a big, “beautiful” wall as high as the tower of Babylon that would keep drugs and crime out of the country. Four years later, almost none of the wall has been built, and border security is quickly becoming a hot topic ahead of the presidential nominations. But what do the American people think about immigration and border security? How concerned are they about these issues? How does it influence their voting behavior? This article covers such questions, and explains how border security could once again hold the key to victory in the 2020 elections.  

A study by the Centre for Immigration Studies has claimed that Republican Mitt Romney would likely have done better in the 2012 elections had he campaigned more extensively for immigration control. The same study also suggests that border security divided opinion along party lines in 2016 more than any other election in US history. Furthermore, Republicans seem to be giving far more importance to this issue. Pew Research reports that 75 percent of GOP voters claimed that immigration is a big problem for the United States, while only 19 percent of Democratic voters agreed. That Trump won the 2016 election despite the overtly exclusionary nature of his rhetoric suggests is further proof that Republicans care deeply about border security. 
In many ways, Trump’s border wall symbolizes why he won. Its truly unprecedented nature represents the anti-establishment advantage he had. While both candidates were considered untrustworthy, Donald Trump held the edge in terms of voter trust in key swing states. Studies show that people in these states trusted Trump more on national security, while they trusted Hillary Clinton on healthcare. Trust on the economy was split evenly between the two, and Trump’s hardline rhetoric is a large reason why he was trusted more on border security. This, again, shows that Trump’s rhetoric was effective in key parts of the country. 

But even after two years in control of both houses, and three years into his presidency, Donald Trump has been unsuccessful in following through on his promise of a border wall. Despite discussion around the literal or metaphoric meaning of a “wall,” barriers are becoming increasingly common across the world. Europe has more barriers today as a result of the migrant crisis than it did during the Cold War. Trump’s failure to build the wall has resulted in several popular supporters, such as Ann Coulter, denouncing his campaign.
To make things worse, a poll shows that Americans now trust congressional democrats more than Trump on border policy. A sample of independents voted 50 percent in favor of Democrats, while only 37 percent chose Trump. The conflict over funding for the border wall led to the longest government shutdown in American history, and is a large reason behind the decline in support for Trump on this issue. 

The good part, for Republicans, is that Trump is still president, and could majorly swing things in the upcoming months. The good part for Democrats is also that Trump is still president, since he will likely not survive inactivity on this issue, and any policy measures Trump takes are bound to cause sharply polarizing responses. It will either win him a re-election, or cause a spectacular disgrace.

706,We Can’t Afford to Raise Minimum Wage to $15,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/we-cant-afford-to-raise-minimum-wage-to-15/,"The U.S. economy is booming, reaching 10 straight years of growth without a recession, and the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in nearly 50 years. The middle-class has benefited greatly from the revitalization of the workforce and an increase in opportunities for employment. Yet, as the growth continues to proliferate throughout the middle class, many are trying to sabotage that growth by increasing the mandated federal minimum wage to $15. For our country to continue this positive economic trend, the minimum wage should not be raised.

Reduced Employee Benefits and Perks
In order to attract quality employees, many business owners offer non-monetary benefits and perks to their employees to keep payroll low and employee morale and motivation high. These benefits and perks can include things like free meals while on the job, flexible work hours and training and development. If the minimum wage is increased to $15, businesses will be forced to spend more money on their employees’ pay, passing on the extra cost to customers. Additionally, employees will likely experience a reduction in tips, overtime, and perks like free food or parking. In general, most large companies prefer to cut costs rather than raise prices if they can, helping not only the employee but the consumer and community as well. 
Significant Job Losses for Hourly Workers
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 2018 report, the majority of hourly workers are young, under-educated employees in the service industry. As a general rule, service industries operate on a very small profit margin and will be unable to continue staffing hourly workers with a minimum wage increase to $15. Hourly workers re-entering the workforce will have few if any future job prospects. That was most recently evidenced in March 2019 in New York City, which saw its sharpest fall in restaurant employment in 20 years. Therefore, raising the minimum wage could cause significant job losses across the country among hourly workers.

Impaired Growth for Small Business
Small-business owners understand that quality staff is the cornerstone of a successful business. Small-business owners also realize employees are the biggest expense of their business. Because 54 percent of all U.S. sales are conducted by the 28 million small businesses and provide 55 percent of all jobs in the U.S., a raise of the minimum wage to $15 per hour will debilitate the small business profit margin and hinder the advancement of the backbone of the American dream.
While the intentions behind raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour may be good, the reality is that it would hurt the very workers it was meant to help.

708,"No, Andrew Yang, Don’t Give Everyone Free Money",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/no-andrew-yang-dont-give-everyone-free-money/,"Andrew Yang, dubbed a “random, opinionated person” by The Washington Post, has made waves on both sides of the political aisle with his 2020 presidential campaign. Running as a Democrat, Yang has appeared in interviews with hosts such as Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, and Dave Rubin, all of who are popular in conservative circles. He has been refreshing to political discourse with his detailed and quirky proposal and believes that the American economy is in the midst of a seismic shift, mainly due to rampant automation. To counter the loss of jobs, he has pushed for a $1,000-a-month, universal basic income scheme that would help citizens adjust to technologically evolving industries. But do his economic plans hold merit?

Giving every citizen above the age of 18 $12,000 a year would cost the government around $2.8 trillion. To fund this massive bill, Yang has suggested a 10 percent Value Added Tax on all transactions, at every level of production. This supposedly puts pressure on Silicon Valley companies like Amazon and Google, who are known to avoid taxes. The VAT is expected to generate around $800 million a year, with additional income over time since Yang has claimed that the VAT will help the US economy grow by around 13 percent.
However, a value-added tax will just make businesses pass the cost onto their customers. Costs will rise, and consumers–not companies–will be the most impacted by the tax. Yang’s claim that the tax will help growth reach 13 percent is also exaggerated, and reports show that the actual number is somewhere half that. In a recent interview, Yang has admitted to the regressive nature of the VAT, but stated in an interview that he is optimistic that the progressiveness of the UBI can tip the scales in his favor. 
Yang’s UBI also comes with a catch. To opt into his $12,000 a year scheme, one will have to opt-out of some welfare benefits that the citizen receives if it adds up to over a $1,000 a month. This will reduce the burden on the government to provide these services, generating additional revenue for his UBI scheme.
Keeping aside the enormous improbability that Yang’s math will add up, his economic policies are based on a misguided fear. Yes, automation is swiftly taking over key industries, but simply giving people money is bound to exacerbate dependence on welfare rather than solving the issue. It is also important to note that trading other welfare benefits for $1,000 a month is unlikely to be beneficial to a significant minority of Americans, given that many of them are dependent on social security for their subsistence. The amount isn’t enough, and though Yang expects the money to return into circulation through spending, its unclear how this is beneficial from a long-term perspective. His 10 percent VAT is another contestable policy.  

Andrew Yang brings an exciting, albeit unrealistic, solution to the table. While he deserves praise for his creativity, ideas can only be taken so far. His UBI is doubtless well-intentioned, but in all likelihood, it will result in massive deficits for the government with no real return besides a decrease in some welfare costs. Yang’s policies treat technological advance as a threat, but they have consistently resulted in economic benefits and will continue to do so. 
Correction: We previously stated that the freedom dividend would reduce social security and disability. This was incorrect and we apologise for the error and have corrected it.

709,Border Patrol Agents Are Passing Around A Commemorative Coin Mocking Care for Migrant Kids,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/donate-border-patrol-agents-are-passing-around-a-commemorative-coin-mocking-care-for-migrant-kids/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
An unofficial commemorative coin has been circulating among Border Patrol agents at the U.S./Mexico border, mocking the task of caring for migrant children and other duties that have fallen to agents as families cross into the U.S.
On the front, the coin declares “KEEP THE CARAVANS COMING” under an image of a massive parade of people carrying a Honduran flag — a caricature of the “caravan” from last fall, which started in Honduras and attracted thousands of people as it moved north. (While the caravan included many women and children, the only visible figures on the coin appear to be adult men.)
The coin’s reverse side features the Border Patrol logo and three illustrations: a Border Patrol agent bottle-feeding an infant; an agent fingerprinting a teen boy wearing a backwards baseball cap; and a U.S. Border Patrol van. The text along the edge reads “FEEDING ** PROCESSING ** HOSPITAL ** TRANSPORT.”


The coin appears to poke fun at the fact that many border agents are no longer out patrolling and instead are now caring for and processing migrants — including families and children.
Government officials told ProPublica the coin was not approved or paid for by the government, unlike official “challenge coins” that go through an agency approval process. One Customs and Border Protection official, who was not authorized to give his name, characterized the coin as “something that somebody’s doing on their free time” — comparing it to woodworking. “A lot of the agents have little hobbies on the side, they build little wooden figures that they have at their homes,” the official said.
It’s not clear who created the coin or how widely it’s been circulated among border agents. But Border Patrol agents in California and Texas — on opposite ends of the U.S./Mexico border — had seen the coin circulated at their workplaces. One of the agents received a coin in April when a colleague brought several to pass around at the office; the other was shown an online order form for the coins by a colleague at work.
Both said the coins were promoted via the secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol officials that, as ProPublica recently detailed, included racist and violent posts.
The coin is part of a tradition of unofficial “challenge coins” — which generally outnumber official ones — which are common in the military and law enforcement as a way for members to celebrate achievements and build camaraderie.
But outside observers found this particular coin anything but harmless.
Theresa Cardinal Brown, who worked at CBP under the Bush and Obama administrations, said that the coin was evidence (like the 10-15 Facebook group) of “reflexive dehumanization” by Border Patrol agents, and that the “tolerance for shenanigans” by supervisors and leadership had gone too far. “You have to say, ‘This is affecting the integrity and authority of us all.’”
The coin appears to have been designed, ordered and distributed months into the surge of Central American families at the border. Coins were being distributed to agents by late April, before the current wave of public attention and outrage over conditions for migrants in Border Patrol custody.
Customs and Border Protection officials said they did not know about the coin until contacted by ProPublica. They said they would investigate it for potential trademark violation since the coin includes the Border Patrol’s logo.
“U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has a firm policy on the use and production of challenge coins bearing CBP identifiers,” a CBP official said, including the U,S. Border Patrol logo. “The coin in question is not an officially approved CBP coin. CBP intends to investigate the matter and will make a determination when all the facts are known.”
However, officials implied that if the coin had not used the official logo, it would be beyond their control. “If it’s something that somebody’s doing on their free time,” said the official who asked not to be named, it is not something the agency can control.
Hector Garza of the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents, said he had not seen the coin either. When shown pictures of it by ProPublica, and in response to follow-up questions, he said, “I have no thoughts about the coin.”
Challenge coins have spread throughout the federal government, but are especially popular within Border Patrol. They depict individual offices or stations or particular missions. If official visitors come by to tour a station, a coin may be presented.
In this case, the “mission” being mockingly commemorated is the unprecedented amount of migrant care and processing Border Patrol agents did in the spring of this year.
Taking care of migrants (including children) in short-term custody is part of the Border Patrol’s job. When the intake system for migrant children is overwhelmed, as it was in 2014 and has been again in 2019, Border Patrol often holds children for longer than the 72 hours prescribed by the federal Flores settlement (a court agreement that governs the treatment of children in immigration custody), often in spaces not designed for children — or anyone. In recent weeks the government has greatly reduced the number of children in Border Patrol custody, thanks in large part to funding from Congress that expanded the intake system’s capacity.
Some agents say that childcare and support have an opportunity cost: Any time an agent spends driving a van full of children to a child-only facility, for example, is time not spent “in the field” apprehending people who are trying to get away.


“Us caring for kids and families, that’s not the frustration,” Garza said. “Drugs coming into the country? That is a frustration. People with criminal records coming in and us not being able to catch them? That is a frustration.”
That tradeoff appears to be fueling the emotions expressed by the coin — with the back side depicting the tasks that agents must do instead of being out “on the line,” and the front side referring to the legal “loopholes” that make it harder to detain and deport migrants under 18 and families.
One Border Patrol agent, when asked about morale among agents detailed to care and transport, replied with a photo of a dumpster floating down a flooded river.

710,It’s Not Only Liberals Who Loathe Donald Trump,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/its-not-only-liberals-who-loathe-donald-trump/,"I am a Republican. I am almost certainly far more conservative than you.
I hurt for all the harm that fool has done to my party. Even more for what he has done to the word conservative.

Acccording to his own budget director, we are headed towards a $1.1 trillion deficit this year alone! That is more than our entire national debt in 1980. Imagine the inflation, that must be controlled by higher interest, that this is causing. There is nothing conservative about deficit spending.
There was a time my party called Democrats the party of war. My party was concerned about out of control military spending. We made A Contract With America, including balanced budgets and to propose a balanced budget amendment. To our eternal shame, we have done none of all we promised. There is nothing conservative about breaking promises.

711,Border Patrol Official Circulates Article That Deems Our Reporting on Secret Facebook Group a Threat,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/news/border-patrol-official-circulates-article-that-deems-our-reporting-on-secret-facebook-group-a-threat/,"ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.
A senior Border Patrol official, who directs a key intelligence-gathering center, on Thursday circulated an inflammatory opinion article that blasted ProPublica’s reporting on a secret Facebook group for current and former agents and described the news organization as a threat to the agency and its members.
A link to the article, which specifically castigates ProPublica reporter A.C. Thompson for his articles about the degrading posts in the group, was sent in an email to top intelligence officials at the agency’s headquarters in Washington and to field offices across the country. Sources said other supervisors then shared it widely with agents under their command.
The article was widely distributed by Michael E. Powell, director of the Customs and Border Protection’s Northern Border Coordination Center, and comes as the heads of the Department of Homeland Security, the CPB, which it oversees, and the Border Patrol have publicly condemned the Facebook posts and launched investigations into the group.
And the article raises questions about whether internally, agency officials may be having different reactions to the public exposure of anti-migrant and misogynistic posts by some of its agents. On Friday, The Intercept reported that Border Patrol head Carla Provost appeared to have once been a member of the group. She has not commented.


A Border Patrol spokesman responded angrily Friday to questions about the significance of a senior intelligence official circulating such an article.
“I’m not going to comment on a third party opinion piece simply because you disagree with it,” said Matthew Leas, a Border Patrol spokesman. “The author isn’t even a CBP employee. Last time I checked, agency responses typically come from the agency…”
Powell did not respond to questions about the email.
The article was published on a website called Law Enforcement Today, and was written by a woman named Dawn Perlmutter, who describes herself as an expert on “symbols, symbolic methodologies, atypical homicide and ritualistic crimes.”
It alleges that ProPublica’s reporting about the secret Facebook group, which was known as “I’m 10-15,” was part of an “anti-police information operation” that was “calculated to incite hatred against CBP, ICE and DHS officers, provide party-line propaganda for the media and ignite protests to further political agendas.” And it claimed that Thompson, who broke the story about the Facebook group, “essentially doxed CBP officers,” when he published the posts.
“Thompson’s byline says he covers hate crimes and racial extremism, when in fact, he perpetuates it,” the piece reads. “His irresponsible reporting incites police hatred and endangers officers’ lives under the guise of social justice.”
One agent who received the piece was troubled that an official in charge of an intelligence unit would send it out under his Border Patrol email, and worried that it could undermine trust in the unit’s work.
“We need effective intel units that have garnered the trust of agents, the community, and elected officials,” said the agent, who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. “Distributing partisan opinion pieces under the guise of intelligence, undermines the credibility of our intelligence department and raises doubt about the intelligence we distribute.”
“Revealing hateful posts circulated to 9,500 people on Facebook hardly constitutes doxing,” said Richard Tofel, the president of ProPublica. “ProPublica seeks to hold public officials to account, including making sure the Border Patrol lives up to the standards of decency that every American law enforcement agency pledges to live by.”
The article’s distribution came as the House Committee on Oversight and Reform held a hearing Friday on recent reports about appalling conditions inside Border Patrol detention facilities and the disturbing Facebook posts revealed in ProPublica and The Intercept’s reporting. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Democrat, had requested that Kevin McAleenan, the acting chief of the Department of Homeland Security testify at the hearing. But McAleenan did not attend.
Instead, the hearing devolved into a fierce partisan debate with Democratic legislators accusing the Republicans of “manufacturing” the crisis at the border for political gain and Republicans admonishing Democrats for “vilifying” border patrol agents.

712,California Statute To Trade Trump’s Tax Release For Ballot Access Is Clearly Unconstitutional,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/california-statute-to-trade-trumps-tax-release-for-ballot-access-is-clearly-unconstitutional/,"Legislation has been introduced in California that would require candidates to make their tax returns public in order to appear on the ballot. The proposal is obviously aimed at forcing President Trump to make his returns public. Would such a law, if passed, be constitutional? The short answer is no, it would not. 
Article 2, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution spells out the qualifications for president: “No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.”
This mirrors the language of Art 1, Section 2 and 3, which set forth the qualifications for members of the House and Senate. For example, Art. 1, Sec. 3 reads:
“No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.”

There are no other qualifications specified. In Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486 (1969), the Supreme Court ruled that the qualifications laid out in the text of the Constitution are complete—that is, states cannot add to them.
In the 1990s, when term limits for Congress were all the rage, supporters of term limits attempted to get around the “qualifications” clause by using the state’s general authority to regulate elections. Instead of directly prohibiting a person from serving more than a set number of terms, they passed state legislation that a person who had served a certain number of terms would be ineligible to appear on the ballot. Voters could still write-in their names, and if victorious as a write-in candidate, the person could still serve, so they argued that they weren’t actually adding to the qualifications in the Constitution. This was challenged in court.
In U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779 (1995), the Supreme Court (majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens) first reaffirmed the holding in Powell:

“In the absence of any constitutional delegation to the States of power to add qualifications to those enumerated in the Constitution, such a power does not exist … the text and structure of the Constitution, the relevant historical materials, and most importantly, the basic principles of our democratic system all demonstrate that the Qualifications Clauses were intended to preclude the States from exercising any such power and to fix as exclusive the qualifications in the Constitution.”
So a state can’t simply require a candidate to disclose taxes as a qualification for holding office.
Next, the court considered whether styling the measure only as a restriction for appearing on the ballot made a difference—if a ballot restriction were an acceptable regulation of the “manner” of elections.
Here the court wrote: “Constitutional rights would be of little value if they could be indirectly denied. The Constitution nullifies sophisticated as well as simple-minded modes of infringing on constitutional protections.”
It continued: “Petitioners would have us believe, however, that even as the Framers carefully circumscribed [legislative] power to set qualifications, they intended to allow [legislatures] to achieve the same result by simply formulating the regulation as a ballot access restriction under the Elections Clause. We refuse to adopt an interpretation of the Elections Clause that would so cavalierly disregard what the Framers intended. …
“The Framers intended the Elections Clause to grant States authority to create procedural regulations, not to provide States with license to exclude classes of candidates from federal office. … [T]he Framers understood the Elections Clause as a grant of authority to issue procedural regulations, and not as a source of power to dictate electoral outcomes, to favor or disfavor a class of candidates, or to evade important constitutional restraints. …
“States are thus entitled to adopt generally applicable and evenhanded restrictions that protect the integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself.”
The court then reviewed its ballot access cases (cases involving state requirements to submit a certain number of signatures before appearing on the ballot, filing deadlines, and independent candidacies), and concluded:
The provisions at issue in Storer [v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724 (1974)] and our other Elections Clause cases were thus constitutional because they regulated election procedures and did not even arguably impose any substantive qualification rendering a class of potential candidates ineligible for ballot position. They served the state interest in protecting the integrity and regularity of the election process, an interest independent of any attempt to evade the constitutional prohibition against the imposition of additional qualifications for service in Congress. And they did not involve measures that exclude candidates from the ballot without reference to the candidates’ support in the electoral process. Our cases upholding state regulations of election procedures thus provide little support for the contention that a state imposed ballot access restriction is constitutional when it is undertaken for the twin goals of disadvantaging a particular class of candidates and evading the dictates of the Qualifications Clauses.”

The court concluded: “[W]e hold that a state amendment is unconstitutional when it has the likely effect of handicapping a class of candidates and has the sole purpose of creating additional qualifications indirectly.” Note that the fact that the requirement applied equally to all potential candidates was irrelevant to the court’s determination.
More broadly, the court has never upheld ballot restrictions that would keep any candidate with reasonable odds of getting a substantial portion (about 5 percent or more) of the vote off the ballot. See e.g. Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23 (1968); Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983); Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279 (1992).
So under Powell, Thornton, and other precedents, it’s quite unlikely that the proposed California measure would get past the U.S. Supreme Court.

713,"If Obama Had Authority To Initiate DACA, Trump Has Authority To Rescind It",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/if-obama-had-authority-to-initiate-daca-trump-has-authority-to-rescind-it/,"The whole idea behind executive orders is that they rely on the authority of the president who signs them—but one president cannot enlarge or diminish the powers and authority of the next president.
The Supreme Court last week chose to consider a challenge to President Trump’s decision to rescind DACA, which stands for Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals.

So, first off, the very concept of President Barack Obama being able to enact an executive order that President Trump is then barred from undoing is repugnant to the constitutional order. It would, in effect, elevate Obama’s solo order into an act of Congress (because it would require the same—an act of Congress—to reverse).
And mark my words, if a Democratic president is elected next year and tries to undo a Trump executive order, the same people arguing that Trump cannot end DACA will be arguing that President 46 (whomever that may be) can undo Trump’s orders with a stroke of a pen.
Second, all DACA ever granted to the “Dreamers” was a deferral of immigration enforcement. That’s inherently temporary, and cannot possibly vest a “right” to its indefinite continuance. And even more so, it cannot confer any triable “right” for persons not yet in the program to gain the benefit of those deferrals.
This is a truly absurd attempt to not only justify Obama’s end-run around Congress, but to invest it with stronger protections than even the most uncontroversially legitimate executive order would otherwise get.
The fact that it’s dragged on this long is frankly an embarrassment to the rule of law.
DACA could be the best executive order ever signed by any president in the history of the Republic, and it would still be constitutionally wrong to deny Trump the power to rescind it.

714,Could a Withering Away Explain Decline of The West? It’s Not Too Late,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/could-a-withering-away-explain-decline-of-the-west-its-not-too-late/,"This may be one of the biggest geopolitical questions out there and seems as pertinent now as it was when Oswald Spengler wrote his Decline of the West (1918).
Oswald Spengler – Author of the the Decline of the West. Source: Philosophy of History Part XVII: Oswald Spengler and the Decline of the West

There are five schools of thought that I have identified here when researching this question. These in a nutshell are their respective positions.
Better Angels (titled taken from Steven Pinker’s The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined): No. The world especially the West is getting better not worse. Crime is falling, health is improving, people are living longer, science is on the march forward, superstitious belief is trending downward and we may indeed be living in the greatest of all times. There is no decline. If the west is losing ground it may be more of a function of the rest of the world catching up than anything else.
Progressive Pessimists: Yes. Neo-liberal economic policies are amplifying wealth disparities and depriving essential services of the necessary government funding that they require. This has been expedited by Trumpism in the US and his tax cut initiatives. Add on to this the climate change crisis and the west and the rest of the world is heading for disaster. Society has to undergo a rapid transition to avoid what is essentially the inevitable. The West can be saved but it needs to transition away from market economics towards policies of ‘inclusivity’. Thinking of oneself as a global citizen would be a positive move. The End of the West and End of days: Is Western civilisation on the brink of collapse?
Left Extreme: Yes.The West is declining. Let it collapse, after all it is racist, sexist, homophobic and was built on the backbone of oppressive policies. Long may it rot. ‘We’ will pick up the pieces afterward and build a new just society. Fuck You, Dying American Empire: Reflections of an Aging Anti-Imperialist
Conservative Pessimists. Yes. Europe in particular has been transformed into a post-christian society that is a shadow of its former self. In the US the Gramscian walk through the institutions has wrecked higher education. Free speech is under threat, socialism is making headway and lax border policies are destabilizing the integrity of the nation state. Couple that to declining birth rates and the rise of Islamism as a political force, and the future does not bode well for the west. What is needed is a greater emphasis on the principles that form the bedrock of Western Civilization, especially Judeo-Christian values. Opinions as to the efficacy of nationalism in this area differ. Check out the links below to books by Jonah Goldberg, Patrick Buchanan and Douglas Murray.
Alt Right: Yes.Decay is everywhere. Our systems have failed. Traditional conservatives are too ecumenical and have conserved nothing. What is needed is a return to a society that rejects the toxic brew of multiculturalism and globalism. In any case a white ethno-state is needed somewhere in the West.
So it all comes down to who you ask and what parameters they most value.
Here is my synthesis.
I think the Better Angels approach makes sense for half the story. The world is indeed improving with respect to health and economic parameters. One can credit science, market economics and the spread of democracy for this reality. Seven reasons why the world is improving.

However this is only part of the story. It is most obvious that the West is also in a demographic death spiral with respect to falling birth rates. Death Spiral Demographics: The Countries Shrinking The Fastest
Entitlement is rampant, education standards are falling and illegal immigration is out of control. Manufacturing sectors have been gutted by an outsourcing mania with power shifting away from the vital middle class to a financial elite that all to often appears as though it has no loyalty to anyone other than themselves.Culture of entitlement not limited to youth
A fixation with identity politics – both race and gender – has further poisoned the water and encouraged an odious narrative that has proved to be extremely divisive. Media spin has fueled this further. The curse of identity politics and the case for shared values – Openforum
Add to this a growing national debt load and and the markers for decline are apparent. U.S. National Debt Hits Record $22 Trillion
Across the board leadership in the First World is poor, but more than anything else most westerners can’t even articulate what our civilization stands for. Is Western Civilization a Thing? – Quillette. While the United States –the epicenter of the West – is still 10 or 15 years behind a moribund Europe in this regard its trajectory is likely to be similar. Europe Paves the Way for Its Decline and Europe is losing its soul.
The ruling class talks with an air of authority, however it often succumbs to the lure of a ‘Realpolitik’ that short-changes shared values for the sake of political expediency.The Arrogant Elite
Islamic based Jihadism will not bring down the West but the inability of centrist leaders to champion western exceptionality and defend the essence of what we have on all fronts will most certainly do. We no longer believe in ourselves and this is tragic. The decline takes the form of a whithering away. Niall Ferguson: why the West is now in decline
While we still have the luxury of the blinker world that engulfs the lives of so many of us we need to move against apathy and indifference. What is needed is a broad movement centered on the engine of the middle class that cuts across ossified party/cultural and race lines and places at its core the Western values of free speech, rule of law, rationalism, an emphasis on shared values, earned respect, and self-sufficiency. It is not too late.

715,"Corn Subsidies Fuel Animal Mistreatment, Factory Farming",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/corn-subsidies-fuel-animal-mistreatment-factory-farming/,"It may sound counter-intuitive, but the primary problem today in achieving the ethical treatment of farm animals in the United States is the hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to America’s corn system.
It’s Time to Rethink America’s Corn System
The most important reason animals are raised the way they are is not because of profits or efficiency of animal husbandry methods, or even due to consumer demand, but rather to be part of the way the buffer stock scheme for corn and soy are managed. We subsidize the overproduction of grains. Since that produces far more grain than every man woman and child in the whole world could possibly ever eat, we need to find ways to get rid of this excess glut.
Ever normal granary buffer stock scheme
Factory farming of animals was designed as a way to use up as much of this stored commodity grains as possible. The efficiency is not in producing food for us, it is instead efficient only in removing the over production. This is the primary reason even things that don’t eat grains are fed grains. For example cows eat grass and forages rather than grains, but in feedlots we use massive quantities to fatten them quickly. Or look at a bag of dog chow ingredients, you might be surprised.
Other things like ethanol and bio-diesel use up the excess that even the animals can’t possibly eat. That’s why even though it is not particularly good for your engine, and reduces your fuel economy, and even usually uses almost as much or more petroleum to produce as energy they yield; we still require their use in most states. We need to somehow get rid of that mountain of excess grain the government spent hundreds of billions of annually subsidizing.

There was never any huge consumer demand to remove sugar from all our food and replace it with high fructose corn syrup. That whole process was specifically undertaken to find yet another way to use up part of the excess grain we produce.
When even that is not enough to get rid of the excess, we flood the international markets with the rest of that never ending ocean of grain. It’s still more than they can possibly use effectively. So that forces other nations to use this same inefficient system of animal husbandry to use up the glut we flooded their markets with too! Otherwise we would cause the collapse of their local food systems too! (which occasionally has happened inadvertently).
So within the framework of the factory farming of plants and animals the governments have subsidized and mandated by regulations, an individual farmer actually does the best he or she possibly can for the animals. Purposeful unethical treatment by a farmer is actually extremely rare. They typically do the best they can and still follow the USDA plan set forth for them. The rare farmer who decides to opt out of the whole USDA plan completely and raise their plants and animals in a 100-percent ethical and environmentally sane manner, risks losing the whole farm. The subsidies are specifically designed to protect only those farmers using USDA approved GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) on crops and animal husbandry systems designated for them. Usually they apply to commodity crops like corn or cotton only and are in the form of subsidized crop insurance so no family farmer can actually profit from them, only financial institutions and major agribusiness corporations. Organic farmers actually have additional regulatory burden and processing costs they must bear in an effort to prevent too many farmers from switching.

In conclusion, the main reason for the abusive factory farming system is the over use of government subsidies and regulatory burden that caused the ethical problem in the first place! So even more regulations really isn’t the solution at all. Quite the opposite actually. The government actually needs to defund this centralized monster they purposely created, rebuild the local infrastructure, and allow a new generation of farmers to gradually fix it themselves.
It would be better for public health, the farmers, the environment and even better for the animals too.

716,The World Really is a Decent Place Filled with Mostly Decent People,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/the-world-really-is-a-decent-place-filled-with-mostly-decent-people/,"One of the most popular film franchises of the last decade has been The Purge series. The premise is simple: for twelve hours all laws are suspended and anything goes, always leading to horrendous and violent depravity. These films are popular in large part because they feed that pessimistic part of our brains that thinks: of course the world will go to hell, people are violent and without someone to stop them, most people will naturally resort to theft and violence. This is a natural impulse for most of us, at least we think so because, in reality, this is a totally unnatural impulse. You have to be taught to think the world is a shithole and that other people are dangerous. Our instincts as children are to love the world and everyone and everything in it. Our parents, our culture, our religions, and our media have lied to us because most people are in fact decent human beings.
And now we can prove it.

The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was right: the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice (a phrase with a more curious and length provenance than I was aware of). More than any other narrative, human history is a long story of progressively better behaved and better-treated people trying to figure out ways to live in harmony with each other. War is the aberration, not the norm. Peace is not exceptional, it is the default. The world and the vast majority of the people on it are getting safer, healthier, more civilized, and peaceful. This is in large part because people are not assholes. The overwhelming majority of people will not steal from you and do not intend you any harm. Recruiting people to fight is not easy because our instinct is, contrary to what movies and religion tell you, not to hurt other people.
The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker laid out a convincing and highly detailed account of how our global glass has been filling for centuries, not emptying. Especially over the last 100 years, humans live with a degree of prosperity unappreciated by most people. For one, wars are less deadly than ever before.
If we adjust for population growth, not a single one of the multiple wars, genocides, famines, or natural disasters of the 20th century ranks in the top ten deadliest historical human events. Interpersonal violence unrelated to war and state conflict is at all-time historical lows. We are less violent as a species than we have ever been before and this is something that we have basically always been able to say. This year is less violent than last year and this seems to have been largely always true.
Human rights have expanded in unprecedented ways. In 1892, not a single country on Earth allowed women to vote but since then it has been a steady creep upwards. Now, in 2019, only one single country (Vatican City) is left in which women do not get to participate to some degree in elections as voters or candidates, even Saudi Arabia has finally relented. Polling demonstrates widespread global support for women’s rights and equality.
One of the reasons for this steady and increasingly fast decline in violence and an increase in peace and cooperation is technological. Today, most of the people alive do not have to struggle to find food, clean water, and shelter. Violence always retreats quickly in the absence of poverty. Another reason is economic: when people have jobs and a way to reliably provide for their families they are less likely to be xenophobic or aggressive to others.
Another reason is that most people really are decent at heart. Nobody actually wants to be an asshole.

The journal Science this week published “Civic honesty around the globe,” describing the results of a global experiment in 335 cities around the world. “We mistakenly assume that our fellow human beings are selfish,” said Alain Cohn, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Michigan and first author of the study. “In reality, their self-image as an honest person is more important to them than a short-term monetary gain.”
The study dropped off over 17,000 ‘lost’ wallets in hundreds of cities in 40 countries over a course of two years. The wallets were unremarkable and with similar contents: business cards, shopping lists in a local language, a key, and sometimes a variable amount of cash. Researchers turned in the wallets at the sorts of places honest people may leave them for their owners, like police stations, hotels, and post offices.
The results astounded the research team. Contrary to economic theory and what may be termed as ‘common sense’ most people returned the wallets. Even wilder, people were more likely to return the wallet the more money was in it. When the wallets contained an amount that would be considered a large amount for the local economy the return rate was 72%.
There was a great deal of variance in return rates between countries. The most honest wallet-returners of large sums were Danes, Swedes and New Zealanders. While China, Peru, Kazakhstan, and Kenya, didn’t rise above a 20% average return rate. Perhaps most surprising, or most predictable depending on one’s cynicism, wallets dropped in Vatican City and at two anti-corruption agencies were never returned.

But why these surprising results? It turns out that classical economics is correct and people really are selfish but that this manifests in an unexpected way: proving to themselves that they are honest people.
The researchers concluded that the primary motivation for returning the wallets was not wanting to see themselves as thieves. The psychological cost of being dishonest was greater than the financial cost of giving up a one-time windfall. This may help explain the results from the Vatican and the anti-corruption bureaus: people working there already have robust self-images of altruism and beneficence which makes the moral justifications easier in their situations.
72% of the seven billion people sharing this planet are honest when nobody is looking – which is the best metric. Don’t be fooled by a media with little credibility and run under the “If it bleeds, it leads” business model. Remember Mr. Rogers’ suggestion to “Look for the helpers” during and after tragedies is not only uplifting it is statistically instructive. One sick person may be able to hurt or murder dozens of people at once with a bomb, gun, or car but that person is always outnumbered. Every time. One murderer versus dozens or hundreds of volunteers to fix and clean up after their horror.

The murderer is outnumbered by paramedics, the bomber outnumbered by firefighters, the thief outnumbered by honest people. This is the state of the world and it always has been. Thankfully there is finally some data to prove it.

717,The Chinese Ethnic Genocide Nobody Cares About,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/ethics/the-chinese-ethnic-genocide-nobody-cares-about/,"The history of the Uighur ethnic group is complicated. Uighurs started off as an ethnic majority in Xinjiang, and they have historically been self-governed. They were originally Buddhist but were only recently forced to convert to Islam.
They only came under the governance of the Chinese during the Qing Dynasty, where they retained a strong ethnic and cultural identity until modern times. This can be seen by the fact that whenever they have been given an opportunity to uprise against the Chinese states they have, there have been many attempts of secession since the Qing rule.
They have many ties to many different regions and countries, they speak a denomination of Turkish, and genetically are extremely similar to Mongolians, although they are an entirely different genetic entity.

People of Hans-Chinese origin have replaced them as the ethnic majority in the region through laws that encourage ethnically Hans-Chinese people to emigrate to the region. China is also using job discrimination on the governmental level, where it heavily discriminates against Uighers when highering for government jobs.  
China is not only committing an ethnic-genocide but also cultural genocide and doing whatever they can to suppress their history and cultural identity. They have even banned their largest expression of culture, their religion. They have suppressed it under the guise of attempting to stamp out religious extremism, but stopping religious extremism doesn’t mean banning traditional Uighur dress, and forcing them to eat pork, which their religion prohibits them from doing.
The PRC is threatening expatriate Uihgurs through violence on their family if they speak out. As Arslan Hidayat, an ethnic Uighur who spoke out against his former country, said, “As soon as you arrive somewhere, Chinese spies will take a photo of you and they’ll send it back and they’ll threaten your family members until you stop protesting [against China].”

China has even started a program of “Uihgur Trackers”, which uses AI to sort through crowds to identify ethnic Uighurs through facial recognition. This program is quickly expanding throughout China. According to the Chinese government, Uighurs are a threat that must be dealt with. They have constantly been treated as enemies of the state and they also major face discrimination within China.
As The Guardian writes, “During one of my visits, the conversation turned to the discrimination that Uighurs faced in this large, Han-majority city. Several diners mentioned the difficulty of finding accommodation, as local hotels frequently rejected Uighur visitors by claiming there were no rooms available. Even a Uighur policeman had been denied a room, someone pointed out with a laugh. Karim, a worldly polyglot who could have easily passed for a Middle Easterner, mentioned how he would sometimes go to a hotel and speak to the front desk staff in English. Mistaking him for a foreigner, they would tell him that there were rooms available, and then backtrack after asking him for his documents and seeing the word Uighur on his Chinese identification card.”
The world is fearful to stand up to China, given that they are a major geopolitical entity and some even believe they are a rising superpower. But, we have already watched what happens when we do not take a proactive approach when fighting against global genocide. The United States must remain to be a beacon of liberty, and fight this with any means possible,  we cannot surrender this position for mere convenience.

This doesn’t need to escalate into war. We could approach China and ask that instead of ethnic cleansing, they simply give up the refugees. Moreover, there are several options of who to give them too, we can ask Mongolia to allow some inside since genetically they have strong Mongolian roots, and we are close allies.  Or we could ask Turkey, given that they already speak the Turkish language, and would assimilate into mainstream Turkish society. We could even ask the European Union to take in some, and take in a bit ourselves.

718,"The Court, Not Roe v Wade, Should Be Up For Review",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/justice/the-court-not-roe-v-wade-should-be-up-for-review/,"The winds are changing and with change comes unrest. One side says “Roe v Wade is established law.” The other side says “Plessy v Ferguson was established law for two-thirds of a century. Sometimes established law can and should be overturned.” And with this, each side makes it clear they intend to do their best to push and pull and otherwise influence the Supreme Court to decide in their favor.
Except that’s not the way it’s supposed to work. The Supreme Court is supposed to uphold the Constitution, not bend to political will. Yet our Supreme Court Justices are referred to as liberal judges and conservative judges. This is not new. These terms have been used for decades. How did we come to this place?

If you go to the Supreme Court’s official website, they describe themselves as “the final arbiter of the law.” Further down the page, they state “When the Supreme Court rules on a constitutional issue, that judgment is virtually final; its decisions can be altered only by the rarely used procedure of constitutional amendment or by a new ruling of the Court.” I was taught these same things in grade school. I was also taught our government was built on the concept of checks and balances. When I asked my teacher how can the Supreme Court be the final arbiter of the law in a system based on checks and balances, the answer was basically “because” and like a good student, I accepted this and moved on. As an adult, I no longer accept that answer.
The issue that most Americans will miss, the true lesson that needs to be learned from all the controversy over Roe v Wade as well as cases like Plessy v Ferguson and the many other political decisions made by what is supposed to be a neutral court, is that the court is not neutral. This is likely due to the fact that it is considered to be the final arbiter of the law. That’s a lot of pressure to do the right thing. If these decisions only affected the people who came to court, such politics wouldn’t matter to the vast majority of us. But these decisions do affect us all, and because of this, proper checks and balances are needed as much here as they are in the other branches of government.

It is the Supreme Court that should be up for review. An amendment should be passed which officially incorporates judicial review into the Constitution along with a method to ensure that the rights of the people are protected. The court should be restrained from making political decisions and giving the government powers the Constitution does not enumerate based on loose readings of whatever clause or phrase is convenient at the moment. And measures should be incorporated which stop efforts to manipulate the court by methods like stacking the court.
In the end, we should do what we can to ensure the Supreme Court is not subject to the influence of changing political winds.

719,"People Have To Find Out What the Government was Doing During 2016 Election, Says Barr",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/people-have-to-find-out-what-the-government-was-doing-during-2016-election-says-barr/,"In an interview with Fox News’s Bill Hemmer, Attorney General William “Bill” Barr expressed his concern again for spying during Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign.
“People have to find out what the government was doing during that period. If we’re worried about foreign influence for the very same reason, we should be worried about whether government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale. And so I’m not saying that happened, but I’m saying that we have to look at that,” Barr said.

Barr first revealed his suspicions during his Mueller Report testimony. He asserted that he thinks “spying did occur” during Trump’s campaign. In later questioning, he then added, “To me, the question is always whether or not it’s authorized and adequately predicated, spying,” and also clarified his meaning of “spying.”
“I’m not going to abjure the use of the word ‘spying.’ I think, you know, my first job was in CIA and I don’t think the word spying has any pejorative convert connotation at all…So I’m not going to back off the word spying to–except I will say… I’m not suggesting any pejorative and I use it frequently, as do media.”
To investigate further the counterintelligence operations during Trump’s campaign, Barr assigned John Durham, a United States attorney, to look further into the origin of the alleged Russian-meddling. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, was also tasked with examining the wiretap applications and the legality of those authorizations.

In answer to a question about Democratic criticism, Barr responded, “Well I think it’s a laughable charge and I think it’s largely being made to try and discredit me, partly because they may be concerned about the outcome of a review of what happened during the election… That means they may be trying to undermine my credibility but obviously you can look at the face of my testimony and see on its face that there’s nothing inaccurate about it.”
He also added that “…there’s a misconception out there that we know a lot about what happened…The fact of the matter is Bob Mueller did not look at the government’s activities. He was looking at whether or not the Trump campaign had conspired with the Russians. But he was not going back and looking at the counterintelligence program. And we have a number of investigations underway that touch upon it — the main one being the office of inspector general that’s looking at the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] warrants.”

720,The First Amendment and Social Media Bans,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/congress/the-first-amendment-and-social-media-bans/,"The bans against Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan, Paul Nehlen, Laura Loomer, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Paul Joseph Watson have made it clear that the major social media platforms have little respect for free speech. However, while they, as private companies, aren’t covered under the First Amendment, they are still covered under the law.
Social media enjoys a protected status. This protection is provided under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. This section was added to the act specifically “(1) to promote the continued development of the Internet”, “(2) to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists”, “(3) to encourage the development of technologies which maximize user control over what information is received”, “(4) to remove disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies”, and “(5) to ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal laws to deter and punish trafficking in obscenity, stalking, and harassment by means of computer.”

To accomplish all this, Section 230 states “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” These policy descriptions promote the idea of a free market in which the consumer decides for themselves what they see or don’t see on the web. In the five policy statements shown above, only No. 5 says anything about punishing anybody and it mentions certain legal conditions under which that is to occur.
If you based your entire argument on No. 5 above, you could make a case that it was perfectly okay to ban the above-mentioned individuals. But laws don’t live in a vacuum. The other four policy statements make it clear that open platforms are expected to be exactly that: open. All of the above individuals had millions of followers showing that in the free market of ideas there were many that agree with them. The fact that there are many who disagree with them does not make a case that they are trafficking in obscenity, stalking, and harassment by means of a computer.

Case law has further advanced this position. Section 230 goes on to say, “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.” Despite the many legally vague words in that statement like “lewd” and “filthy” and “otherwise objectionable,” the courts have held that the materials to be removed must meet the standards expressed in the more easily legally definable terms such as “obscene” and “harassing.”
As you get further into the policy statements and definitions provided in Section 230, it gets harder to make a case for banning the above-mentioned people. So why did it happen? Why were those people banned? And why isn’t there already major lawsuits against the social media platforms? Because even though the courts have restrained the loose language which sets the standards for taking “vigorous enforcement” actions against those who fail to comply, they are allowing open platforms to make publishing decisions. Specifically, courts have consistently held that exercising traditional editorial functions over user-submitted content, such as deciding whether to publish, remove, or edit material, as acceptable under Section 230.
In essence, the courts are allowing social media to act as publishers but the courts aren’t treating them as publishers. In fact, since the passage of Section 230, the courts have consistently tilted the balance sheet in favor of open platforms. It’s practically like the courts have given social media carte blanche while at the same time they remain pretty much impervious to lawsuits.

The position of the courts flies in the face of the policy goals clearly stated in Section 230. Protecting open platforms from being treated as publishers while allowing them to make publishing decisions does not provide a free market in which the consumer decides for themselves what they see or don’t see on the web. Unfortunately, courts generally build on previously existing case law which means are not likely to turn back now.
New legislation shouldn’t be necessary even though the courts have moved away from the spirit of the law. If we want to see open platforms return to being open platforms, Congress should simply clarify Section 230. Either that or do away with this protection and let these social media giants defend their publishing decisions in court.

721,Do Political Quizzes Define You?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/opinion/do-political-quizzes-define-you/,"As political tensions rise, more and more people are allowing their friends and family to define their political beliefs. And, they’re allowing so-called political spectrum quizzes to determine how they politically identify themselves.
I checked out eight popular quizzes. They were all biased. After all, they’re written by humans and all humans are biased. With some more biased than others, I tried to figure out why and came to the conclusion that the quiz makers were handling their bias in one of three ways.
First, there were the quizzes that didn’t seem to think that their bias had an adverse impact so they didn’t try to correct for it.

For example, The Political Spectrum quiz emphasizes a two sides view of the world and I have always been a third side person.
The test suggested, “People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality“. Since I believe the concept of class is anachronistic, is my only choice nationality?
But since I live in a nation with numerous cultures, many of which have anything to do with nationality, that’s not a good choice either. How do I take a political quiz that disregards my political views? The results of this test could never possibly reflect my take on things.
Second, there were quizzes that you could tell tried to sift as much of the bias out of their questions as possible. In ISideWith, for “(Q) Should the military allow women to serve in combat roles?” you have all of the following possible answers:
Yes
No
Yes, as long as they can pass the same physical tests as men
Yes, preventing women from serving in combat roles is discriminatory
No, women are not as physically capable as men for combat
No, combat roles place women in a high-risk situation for sexual assault
No, men are more likely to risk the success of a mission in order to protect women from danger
Read more stances submitted by users
Add your own stance
This question is no longer relevant and should be removed
Note that this is still basically a yes/no answer. Even though it’s a two-sided type question, they give you the opportunity to find common ground with the answers.
Third, there were quizzes that tried to account for their biases by looking at politics from numerous angles. For example, in each topic, the Polquiz provides a scenario and then offers three different ways of looking at that scenario.

“(Q) In some institutions, groups or professions, there is a disparity between the number of men and women, or between different races or social groups“
Your choices are:
Quota obligations are the best instrument to remedy historical situations of discrimination.
Integration subsidies or tax benefits to underrepresented groups are the best instruments to address discrimination.
Any imposition or benefit based on criteria of sex, race or social group, violates the principle of equality before the law, and should not be imposed by the Government.
Here are the quizzes I took in the order that my particular bias organized them starting with the least biased. Please note that the first two were practically tied for being least biased with the third coming in very close behind.
https://www.isidewith.com/
https://www.people-press.org/quiz/political-typology/
https://8values.github.io/
http://www.polquiz.com/
http://thepoliticalaffiliationquiz.org/
https://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/
https://www.politicalcompass.org/
https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/story.php?title=what-is-your-political-ideology_1
Don’t go thinking that taking that first quiz right off the top of the list is all you need to do to figure out your politics. I recommend taking at least the first four and if you really want to go in depth take them all. Remember, even the best tests are biased. Several points of view would be much more helpful.
And that’s not all. If you let them, these tests will define you. That’s not what you need. These quizzes are tools that can give you the basis for more self-exploration. For instance, the following graphic is from iSideWith:

I’m represented by the blue circle with a star in it near the upper right-hand corner. Based on this I’m somewhat right-wing and significantly libertarian. Now let’s look at the graphic from Polquiz:
I’m the target near the top. This identifies me as barely right of center and extremely libertarian. If you read my bio then you know this is exactly how I describe myself. Even though I believe iSideWith is less biased, I feel that polquiz did a better job of identifying my politics. Of course, that could be my bias talking.
This is an important lesson. None of these tests is perfect. Letting someone else’s biases define you will not serve you well. In the end, you need to define yourself.

722,China is Lying About Its Economy,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/china-is-lying-about-its-economy/,"China is often used as an example of a rapidly growing emerging market. On the surface, it seems like it is among the fastest growing large economies in the world, although, no major economic institution believes this myth. Many economists (and many corporate entities) place China’s real economic growth at 2 points lower than what they actually claim. Furthermore, many independent economists also estimate that China’s economy is 18% beneath what they claim.
China’s ‘economic growth’ is measured by local governments in China. Each year, China conducts a census where it asks local governments how much they’ve earned. They give major incentives for meeting ‘goals’ set up by the party.  This system encourages lying, given there is absolutely no enforcing local governments, to tell the truth. China also measures cash-flow instead of economic profitability.

Chinese economists have even admitted they have lied on multiple occasions.
China is also deceiving the world about its debt. According to recent estimates, they have a debt to GDP level of around 300%, which is three times larger than the US’s infamous debt, clocked at around 108% this year, and several times larger than the Italian debt which is 131% of GDP. You cannot remain stable while having such high levels of debt, especially whilst levels of economic growth are decreasing.
China is having other major economic problems, from being forced to bailout important Chinese companies, to having the worst stock market rout since 2015 while having an inflation problem. They are also expected to have .2% less economic growth this quarter, due to President Trump’s trade tariffs. They give a petty excuse of using Macro-Economics to counteract the tariffs, which they are doing as a ploy. There is no way to counter cold hard economic facts.

As Sun Tzu so eloquently stated, “Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.”.

723,The Alleged U.S. Constitutional Crisis,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-alleged-u-s-constitutional-crisis/,"Democratic House Judiciary chairman Jerrold Nadler recently attracted public attention over his claims that America is in a constitutional crisis. This comes after Congress voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt after denying them full and un-redacted Mueller report and not showing up for a hearing by the House. “We’ve talked for a long time about approaching a constitutional crisis,” Nadler told CNN, “We are now in it.”
When asked about it, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave the same pronouncement.

The Backstory
In March 2019, Barr released the Mueller report after necessary legal redactions by the Attorney General, Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, and head of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller. The investigation, “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”
Democrats claimed that the 448 pp. report isn’t enough and demanded the full report. Barr later released a less redacted version of the report to members of Congress. It only contained very few redactions, only a few lines, in fact , but not a single Democrat has looked at it.
Although Democrats continue to demand the release of the report, not only is the AG not legally obligated to release it, but he is prohibited from doing so, in accordance with the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), which prohibits the disclosure of grand jury material, even to members of Congress. Barr would have to break the law in order to appease them.
Despite having testified for hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month, Democrats remained unsatisfied, calling Barr before the House House Judiciary Committee as well. Barr declined to do so because he did not want to be questioned by people other than members of Congress. This was followed by the vote declaring Barr as being in contempt of Congress, and Nadler’s claims that we are in a constitutional crisis.

The contempt declaration is unlikely to have much effect. Former Attorney-General Eric Holder, who described himself as Obama’s “wingman”, was declared to be in contempt of Congress for refusing to testify about the scandal “Fast and Furious”, but the declaration of Contempt of Congress was of little consequence.
Is the Trump administration’s refusal to follow Congress’s directions truly a constitutional crisis? Not at all. Not only is this not a new situation, but this is exactly what is needed to preserve our republican form of government, as counter-intuitive as that may seem. Congress is not superior to the Executive Branch, as Nancy Pelosi has claimed. No branch of government is superior to the other.
In Federalist Paper No. 51, entitled “The Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks and Balances Between the Different Departments”, Madison, wrote the following.
“In order to lay a due foundation for that separate and distinct exercise of the different powers of government, which to a certain extent is admitted on all hands to be essential to the preservation of liberty, it is evident that each department should have a will of its own; and consequently should be so constituted that the members of each should have as little agency as possible in the appointment of the members of the others.

…It is equally evident, that the members of each department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the executive magistrate or the judges, not independent of the legislature in this particular, their independence in every other would be merely nominal.”
So it was not intended that one branch should necessarily obey the other, although it is often desirable to work together. But this is not always desirable. Gridlock, although not pleasant for either party, is necessary in order to prevent the whole government from running in one direction for too long a time, but can be overcome if both sides put aside partisan politics. Gridlock is both normal and necessary, and not a constitutional crisis.

724,What Did Mueller Really Say to Barr?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/what-did-mueller-really-say-to-barr/,"In today’s era of online news and quick diffusion of information, it is extremely easy to distort anything to fit your agenda.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s letter to Attorney General William “Bill” Barr was immediately the subject of interest. Several reputable sources such as the Washinton Post and Vox have released stories about how Mr. Mueller was complaining about how the summary misled and lied to people.
But that’s without context. The pro-Trump subreddit r/The_Donald released a picture criticizing the WaPo article, saying that it wasn’t Mr. Barr that had misled the public, but the media representation of it.

However, Mr. Mueller’s letter is quite confusing upon initial reading.
“… the introductions and executive summaries of out two-volume report accurately summarize the Office’s work and conclusions. The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions. We communicated that concern to the Department on the morning of March 25. There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation.”
Mr. Barr reportedly talked to Robert Mueller on the phone about the letter, in which he later said:
“My view of events was that there was a lot of criticism of the special counsel for the ensuing few days, and on Thursday [March 28] I got this letter,” Barr said. “And when I talked to the special counsel about the letter, my understanding was his concern was not the accuracy of the statement of the findings in my letter but that he wanted more out there to provide additional context to explain his reasoning on why he didn’t reach a decision on obstruction.”

Politifact has proven that the Attorney General really did speak with Mr. Mueller on the phone.  We don’t, of course, know what was said, but since the story checks out and the proffered explanation of the letter is not implausible, we have no reason to suspect that the conversation didn’t go as Barr alleges.

725,Google’s Results Are Biased Towards Liberal Websites,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/googles-results-are-biased-towards-liberal-websites/,"Google is the king of the internet. When they push out a major algorithm update, webmasters race to optimize their websites. Whether it was adopting SSL, or making websites faster — Google decides.
They don’t publish their exact ranking factors, which leads people to wonder whether or not Google takes into account political affiliation. (They shouldn’t.)

As you can see, liberal news websites are significantly more dominant in Google search results, and, based on the data, tend to outrank similar conservative news websites.

Google Vs. DuckDuckGo
Being privacy-focused and completely non-personalized, DuckDuckGo is generally considered the most “unbiased” search engine. Here’s how it stacks up for “trump news.”

Besides having more variety, DuckDuckGo’s results are a lot more evenly spread out.
DuckDuckGo
Google
While their ranking factors are probably different, based on one search results, DuckDuckGo is a lot more unbiased than Google — and Google is skewed towards liberal websites.
Conclusion
From the data, we can conclude that the Google search results were favoring liberal websites.
It is also possible to conclude that DuckDuckGo results have a greater political variety compared to Google.
A WIRED article provides a case for Google not being politically biased, but it doesn’t explain the absence of conservative websites appearing.
Our advice? Don’t believe everything you see. When in doubt, cross check the information and consider what a viewpoint is missing.

Methodology Explained
During the study, I considered a variety of factors, including bias, ranking position, DA, and number of appearances. As outlined below, there are some potential flaws and inaccuracies.
Importance:
Rank Position: Users are more likely to click on higher ranking links, making higher rankings more valuable and contested.
Bias: The purpose of the study was to determine the political bias of results in Google. I used data from MediaBiasFactCheck.com.
Domain Authority: To account for other ranking factor, I used Moz’s Domain Authority Metric. In general, when the same content is published at the same time, the website with a higher D.A. will rank higher.
Bias Offset
The Bias Offset factored in each website’s Moz DA, Bias, and Search Position. Higher ranking websites were given higher scores since their impact is greater (users are more likely to click on it). The Bias Multiplier adjusts the initial rank value to include bias.
A #1 ranking website with Left bias (20*-2 = -40) will have a higher impact on the Bias Offset than a #2 ranking website with Left bias (19*-2 = -38).
The resulting number is divided by Moz DA to adjust for the fact that there are other ranking factors.
IE: #1 position Left bias website with Moz DA of 23, #2 position Right bias website with DA of 98.
20*-2 / 23 = -1.74 (Unreasonable)
19*2 / 98 = 0.39 (Somewhat Reasonable)
Higher number = greater impact so a website with a Bias Offset of -1.74 would show extreme favoritism of website, most likely more political reasons. As ranking positions go down, each individual number would also go down since lower rankings have less impact.
In the end, the numbers are added together. An unbiased search ranking would be along the lines of this:
20*1 / 98 = 0.2
19*-2 / 92 = -0.41
18*1 / 93 = 0.19
etc..
Total: -0.3
A website with a very low DA comparatively would throw the results off and would be a signal of unfair rankings.
Comparison
Using the extractor, results from Google and DuckDuckGo were compared for the same search term and analyzed the same, except the Bias Offset of omitted, as it was already very clear that the results were a lot more evenly spread out.

Potential Flaws
MediaBiasFactCheck’s method for determining bias has been criticized before. While usually accurate, its method is not very scientific and has room for human error
Google also considers other ranking factors besides backlinks (Moz DA’s main calculation factor), mainly actual content.
Google’s results are constantly changing, especially for news — maybe just these batches were biased?
Moz’s link database isn’t as large as Google’s — their could be more undiscovered links/ranking factors
Human error

726,"The Thing is, Trump will Probably Win 2020",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/the-thing-is-trump-will-probably-win-2020/,"Donald Trump’s presidency has been anything but predictable.
It’s a continuous roller coaster and no one can really know what might follow, but underneath all the noise, the commander-in-chief has actually done a better job than many might have thought.
Yes, the presidency has been controversial with Trump often angrily-tweeting from behind his phone, but has he worked enough to get re-elected as Democrats gear up to remove the businessman-turned-politician out of the White House? With a successful midterm election from the Democratic Party, one might think the president holds a bleak chance of regaining office, however, things might not be what they seem.
In fact, if history is any indicator, President Trump is well on his way of holding the office for an additional four years.
You wonder why? All you see are unflattering headlines and angry outburst on media from the commander-in-chief but we have some news for you: Trump is here to stay.

Polls do not translate to actual results
According to a recent Fox News poll, less than 40 percent of voters would re-elect Trump, if the elections were to happen right now. A majority of the voters said they would rather see someone else hold office. When looking at the negative polls for the president one would assume that the public has spoken, however, traditionally, the question if a sitting president would be re-elected has usually failed to predict the actual outcome of the elections.
According to CNN’s Harry Enten, in 1980 and 1992, the voters’ poll resulted in favor of the sitting president, however, both the times the president would end up losing the elections. Similarly, 1984, 1996 and 2012 cycles, when the polls didn’t favor the president, he would go on to win.
Incumbency comes with its own set of advantages
A defending champion always seems like a safer bet. It is as simple as that.
Trump, like other presidents before him, has already run a successful campaign. He knows what worked for him and what didn’t. The re-elections are the incumbent’s playing field, one that he knows well. Anyone up against him will have to work that much harder to uproot him from the office.
History also supports incumbents. 15 out of 20 presidents seeking reelection, since 1900, have come out victorious at the end of their election campaign. It has been proved rather difficult to boot out a president from the office before they complete their eight years. In fact, the more controversial the president, the bigger the re-election victory and Trump is nothing if not controversial. even his critics would agree.

Economic growth plays a huge role
Trump’s biggest concern as a president is the economy and if all goes well for the commander-in-chief, it could be the biggest factor in what drives him over the line in the 2020 elections.
The GDP has been steadily growing under the Trump presidency. Should Trump avoid an economic recession by 2020, his overall numbers should secure him the votes he needs to be president once again.
The GDP growth and the falling numbers of unemployment bring good news for the president.
The unemployment has also been going down as they were by the end of Barack Obama’s presidency. If these two economic indicators are to go by, Trump will probably emerge victorious.

People want to watch Trump
Love him or hate him, Trump has his appeal.
People want to watch him. Whether it was as a businessman in a reality TV show or a president running the country, Trump has managed to grab people’s attention – and keep it.
It may seem like nothing but it is important.
For a representative of the people, it is important that people pay attention to what he has to say. People might not agree with Trump, yet they listen to what he has to offer. While many Democrats hope that America will finally tire of the “Trump Presidency Show,” the latest numbers show no decline in viewership.
According to The New York Times, prime-time ratings for CNN, MSNBC and Fox News have seen a constant rise since 2014.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer recalled when a cab driver once told her that he would be voting for Trump and the only reason for his vote was that the then-presidential nominee made him laugh.
Now, 3 years into his presidency, Trump has successfully kept the audience glued to their screens.
Midterm elections, historically, mean nothing
Winning 40 extra seats in the 2018 Midterm elections, the Democrats gained control of the House, while Republicans kept control of the Senate.

While the ending of the Republican Federal Trifecta had many people predicting the future of the presidency based off of the 2018 midterm results, previous presidencies have shown that these results mean next to nothing when it comes to the re-election for Trump.
Bill Clinton’s party, in 1994, and Obama’s party, in 2010, both lost House seats in midterm elections (Clinton lost 52 while Obama lost a whopping 63), yet, two years later they came out on top in their re-election bid by a huge margin. Considering these results, history proves that midterm election result may switch control of the House or Senate but they hold a much smaller significance when it comes to the president.
Weak Democratic nominations
Another advantage for Trump is that we still do not know who is going up against him. There are over a dozen Democrats going head-to-head to win the party’s presidential nomination.
However, it is quite difficult to predict which way the Democrats are going to lean. Will they go the Joe Biden way, a seasoned politician that the public is familiar with? In recent years, John Kerry, John McCain, and Hillary Clinton have all faced defeats. People, apparently, do not want the same faces, who have had their chance, to run America.
Or, will they go for candidates like Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren? Both the women represent the far-left and, if nominated and elected, would become the first female president of the US. However, extreme ideologies scare people and many voters might be inclined to vote for Trump because they do not want an extreme cultural change.
Therefore, if the president can avoid an economic recession, it is very likely that he would resume his days at the Oval Office with a successful re-election bid in 2020.

727,What It’s Like To Attend a Gun Show,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/ethics/what-its-like-to-attend-a-gun-show/,"Early this month, while helping some friends move one Saturday morning, I heard about a gun show that was going on in our area. Having a little free time after finishing up, I decided I wanted to attend, and convinced my dad to go with me.
Despite being incredibly passionate about firearms and a major advocate for gun rights, I’d never actually been to a gun show before, and I wasn’t quite sure what to expect. I was pretty excited, though I wished I’d had someone who was more experienced with these sorts of events with me to point out things of interest.
After paying a small fee and getting our hands stamped, we got into the massive indoor event. Though the room was chock full of interesting stuff, the first thing that really drew my attention and distracted me from everything else was the large Gatling gun just beside the door.

Positioned alongside a table piled high with flintlock pistols, muskets, and other antique firearms, the massive Colt 1883 Gatling Gun was a sight to behold. I had heard about and seen pictures of just such a weapon before, but had never seen one in person.
Seeing my interest, one of the men selling the antiques was more than happy to come over and talk about the weapon. Describing how his friend had come across ten of them for sale years back and snapped up every last one of them only to sell all but one for exorbitant prices before he even made it back home, he walked me through what he knew about the gun’s history, and the history of Gatling guns like it.
It was quite enthralling, and I could have stayed there all day listening to the stories behind the various firearms he had, but there was other stuff I wanted to check out. Eventually, I managed to pull myself away and get a look at the rest of the stuff around the room.
The show was extremely crowded and busy, with countless families perusing the numerous items around the room. There were areas devoted to antiques, modern items, scopes and attachments, World War Two memorabilia, and all sorts of other doodads.
Despite joke signs on a lot of the tables saying things like “For an extra $4.99, we’ll give you a receipt saying you paid for what you tell your wife you paid for,” the show was clearly a family event to most people, and the fact that Utah tends to have some of the biggest families in the United States was certainly evident by the number of kids accompanying their parents.

As I waited behind a ton of people to get a chance to examine some sort of custom designed setup of two AR-15s attached to a crank, I listened to a couple of kids, a little boy and girl around nine or 10, examine a number of handguns next to me. They talked to the seller about the firearms, discussed how the grips felt, their ergonomics, and more, while a man who I presumed was their father stood nearby and occasionally made comments.
I was impressed by the discipline and care that the two kids showed while handing the firearms, even in their flagged states. They knew exactly what they were doing and what they were looking for, and when they finally decided what they wanted, their dad stepped up to work out the purchase with the seller.
There was tons of odd but interesting stuff around the room, from the hand cranked twin AR-15s to the perhaps more practical ingenious CLP system that was shown off at one table. As one of the sellers said when I inquired about all the custom stuff, “This is where the real innovation happens. Between trying to comply with all the ridiculous laws and maximizing functionality, people make some of the most creative and inventive things here.” How much of it was actually useful instead of just gimmicky is up for debate, but it certainly was cool.
It was interesting to see how a lot of the people at the show were people I knew from elsewhere. I recognized one guy who works at my school, and another dude who lived in my neighborhood. As I went around the room, my dad and I even bumped into a business associate of his at a small table in the back who was selling custom made leather wallets and a bunch of other stuff. The event was filled with just your ordinary people from all over.
The political atmosphere across the whole show was pretty much what one might have expected. Don’t Tread On Me T-Shirts everywhere, MAGA hats, laughs about the left, and eye rolls or complaints about various infringements on liberty.

I got talking with one of the larger dealers about his take on the political environment and whatnot, and he mentioned how a lot of the recent pushes for gun control have been spurring demand, and his frustration with Trump.
“For the last couple of years we’ve been in the Trump Slump. People feel comfortable that their rights were secure, and it’s been pretty hard on gun dealers and the firearms industry. With everything Trump’s been doing lately with the Bump Stock Ban, and the whole ‘Take the guns first’ thing, along with all the other gun control nonsense out there however, we’ve seen a massive increase in business. I had boxes and boxes of guns here this morning, and now I’ve sold out practically my entire stock. Same for a lot of the other guys here I think.”
I noted that I felt President Trump’s statement in that regard had been misrepresented somewhat, and he agreed, laughing about how everything people say gets twisted and taken out of context. Still he noted, “I don’t care what Trump says, I care about is what he does, and the problem is that right now nobody has any clue what he’s going to do. The man relishes being unpredictable, and I can’t count that he’s going to protect gun rights if it comes down to it.”
I asked if he personally felt that gun control was at all a positive, since for him and other people who make their living selling guns since it spurs demand. “In the short run,” He replies, “from a business standpoint it’s great for us. In the long run though, it’s just bad for everyone.”
“I just wonder what the tipping point is going to be. People will say, ‘Well, if this ever happens, they’ll have a revolution on their hands.’ And then it happens, and I’m just like okay, where’s your revolution? And they say, ‘Okay, well but if this ever happens, I won’t give in.’ Baby steps, you know?

I get friends calling me up from California and the like telling me about how they registered their gun and promptly had guys show up at their door to confiscate it for some obscure violation. And I’m just like, I can help you move to a more sane state man, but besides that there’s not much I can do.”
As the event started to close up, my dad’s business partner came over and asked us if we’d help him move some of his stuff back to his car while we were talking to the dealer. They got into a conversation about leather holsters and the difficulty of finding good ones to buy or even sell. Trying to convince my dad’s friend to consider making custom holsters to sell with him, he offered him a deal and jokingly extended an offer to me and my dad. “Give you both a hundred dollar discount each if you’ll ride your friend on the leather holster thing.” He said, flashing a smile. “I can run the background check right now while I’m doin’ his.”
In the end though, despite how much I really wanted one of the beautiful firearms he was selling, I had to decline. I hadn’t come to buy a gun, this time at least, and I only wanted to spend my money on snacks.
We stuck around pretty late, talking to different people and enjoying ourselves until the event’s organizers shooed everyone out. On the whole though, the show was very enlightening and a lot of fun. It was a bit of a new experience for me, and one that I really appreciated.
I’m definitely looking forward to attending the next one in my area.

728,"OPINION: No, Democrats Shouldn’t Let Bernie Get Away With Tax Dodge",https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/opinion-no-democrats-shouldnt-let-bernie-get-away-with-tax-dodge/,"There is no other way to say it, but I am writing this with an incredibly heavy heart.
To say that I could well have my heart broken is no understatement.
For any who thinks my feelings are too melodramatic or over-the-top, consider how the one-time fans of Pete Rose must have felt upon his fall from grace. Or, perhaps, more accurately, the feelings of those Clinton true believers who stood with him as stalwart as could be when he declared, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky,” only, of course, to be let down.
I’m speaking of my long-time political hero, really the figure who I have considered the conscience of the nation, Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The reason for my sudden dismay?
Sanders’ performance during a CNN town hall. Specifically, what Sanders had to say for himself when asked about releasing his tax returns as a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.
He knew better. Or at least should have known better. This isn’t the senator from Vermont’s first presidential run. Sanders is the candidate who consistently is supposed to be putting political power back into the hands of average Americans. That begins with voters expecting full disclosure from their candidates.
Say what you will about Hillary Clinton as a flawed candidate, but she released tax returns like there was no tomorrow.
So the word “disappointment” doesn’t begin to describe it when, instead of forthright disclosure, the senator from Vermont began speaking like a garden-variety double-talking politician, mumbling something about us seeing his tax returns “soon.”
“We have to do just a few more little things,” he said.
I’m forced to agree with conservative Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin when she asks, “Do what things?”
And Rubin is right by saying: “The excuse that he and his wife don’t have a fleet of accountants doesn’t make any sense when we are talking about 10 years of prior years’ returns. Presumably, those were completed long ago. “
Despite the personal anguish it may cause we Sanders supporters, Rubin is also absolutely and unerringly right to headline her column on the subject, “Are Democrats Going To Let Sanders Get Away With This?”
Because, of course, the only intellectually honest answer is, “No.”
We can’t harangue Donald Trump for years over his refusal to disclose his tax returns–to the point that a congressional committee is preparing to drag Trump’s returns into the light of day–but then somehow give Bernie a pass.
Let Republicans be the hypocrites. Democrats have no business going down that road.
What would possibly cause a 70-something man who spent most of his life of modest means–and only came into anything close to wealth in just the past few years–to have tax issues?
But that’s the point: we won’t know until Sanders releases the returns.
I can’t describe how difficult it is to write this. My love for Bernie Sanders predates his 2016 presidential run by decades. I grew up not far from where he was mayor of Burlington, Vt. And I remember eagerly reading the interviews with him published in the Socialist Workers Party newspaper I received as a kid. (Yes, I know, I was either odd or precocious, depending on your point of view.)
But now it’s time for Bernie to walk the walk. He’s spoken often about the need for our political leaders to be better. Well, it’s time to match word with deed.
The Bernie Sanders campaign should either begin releasing his tax returns or withdraw his candidacy for the nomination.
We know what Trump and the Republicans stand for. It is up to Democrats to be something else, to be the shining beacons of ethics that the nation needs.
There can be no mush or muddle, not even for someone as distinguished as Sen. Bernie Sanders.

729,We Should Be Thanking Trump for Declaring a National Emergency,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/crime/we-should-be-thanking-trump-for-declaring-a-national-emergency/,"President Trump wants his wall. He has shown through the record-breaking government shutdown that he isn’t going to take anything less than a wall.
Democrats have shown that they aren’t going to accept anything that will allow Trump to build his wall. Even the bill signed by Trump for future funding only provided $1.4 billion for a border barrier. The new funding bill also placed restrictions on what types of borders could be built.
Trump said he wasn’t happy with this deal, but rather than vetoing it, he passed it and declared a national emergency instead.
The National Emergencies Act was passed in 1976 and gave the government the power to:
call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion.
suspend consideration of writs of habeas corpus “when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.”
bring felony charges without presentment or grand jury indictment in cases arising “in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger.”
allow a state government to engage in war without Congress’s approval if “actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.”
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency#United_States
A national emergency would allow Trump to allocate military construction funding to his border wall, thereby bypassing the Congress completely.
Trump said “there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border,” but also said afterward that he “didn’t need to do this.”
People on the left were very critical about his decision, and soon after the declaration, 16 states, led by California (of course), sued Trump. They claimed it was unnecessary and an abuse of power.
With all the negative press, most people would assume it’s a bad thing — but is it really?
Declaring a national emergency was probably the smartest choice Trump could have. No matter what Trump does, people are going to criticize him. However, a national emergency is much better compared to a second government shutdown.
The last time we had a shutdown, the economy lost over $10 billion, because neither Trump nor the Democrats would compromise. What says they will now?
Another shutdown would last for days, even weeks, and would not only affect workers, but would also damage the economy, suspend some public services, and create many other problems. A national emergency doesn’t affect daily activity: just the military budget.
Imagine what would have happened if we had another shutdown. The media would be over Trump immediately, with stories like, “Donald Trump Refuses to Cooperate, Causing 2nd Shutdown,” while in reality, its due to the lack of bipartisan agreement on both sides.
And for those that claim we don’t have a crisis at our border, that’s not true.
Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants cross our border illegally. They cost the government billions of dollars in taxpayer money. A huge portion of illegal drugs also come through our Mexican border.
Many people take the wall too literally. Yes, we need a wall to help make the border patrols job easier. However, the wall obviously isn’t a cure-all solution. Most Republicans don’t expect the wall to fix all our immigration problems. We simply want to make the border patrol’s job easier and make people cross through valid points of entry.
A wall also sends a message. Not an immoral one like Nancy Pelosi says, but one that shows we are going to take border security seriously now. Border security has been a huge issue with the US that hasn’t been properly addressed, and Trump is finally implementing fixes that work.

730,Here are 6 good things that Trump has done.,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/here-are-6-good-things-that-trump-has-done/,"1. Stricter Immigration Policies
For many years I did a lot of business along the Texas-Mexico border. Trump is bringing to light the insane immigration laws that make our country the laughing stock of the world. I could sit on the balcony of my hotel room and watch the women waddle across the border in order to get to an emergency room to have a baby on the U.S. taxpayers dollar. That baby would be a “citizen” and an anchor baby.  I also saw the corruption of the Mexican government.  The results of the drug wars.  The inequalities in trade etc.
No one in Texas is against legal immigration. But people including Hispanics who are directly affected by the crime, drugs, low pay pressures, human sex slaves, etc. connected with open borders want border control. They also want an end to the insane practices like considering any baby born in the U.S. to be a citizen, to allow anyone who memorizes the phrase “I am seeking asylum” to be let in, undocumented immigrants getting welfare, etc.
Both the Democrats and the Republican politicians benefit from the cheaper than slave labor that undocumented immigrants provide.  Most Americans would benefit from only allowing legal immigrants who can make a positive contribution to enter our country.
The Democrats always point out that some border cities like El Paso and Laredo are safer than average. Yes, that is true. For 2 reasons. The undocumented immigrants go north. And the drug cartels maintain the peace. Just over the river on the Mexican side, there is a daily blood bath. The drug dealers want neutral zones for their families to shop and go to school.
The idea that no terrorists or even Muslims are crossing the borders total nonsense. My husband’s family came to the U.S. via Mexico. Yet their first language was Arabic. Just watch Mexican soap operas on TV. About 20 % of the beautiful women are of middle eastern heritage. The fastest growing religion in Latin America is Islam. The Cubans and Hugo Chavez ran a communist commando training camp on the Isle of Pines. It is estimated that they trained over 30,000 potential fighters from other Latin countries.
Heroin and other deadly drugs are primarily brought in across our southern border. The Mexican cartels control the U.S. distribution throughout the nation. There are more members of various Latin gangs like MS-13 in the U.S. than ISIS members worldwide. In fact, LA has more gang members just on its own.
The drug gangs of Mexico and Central America do not respect the law at all. If bribery does not work, they use violence. They kill mayors, judges, jurors, cops, informants, competitors – often by brutally torturing them to death in unimaginable ways.
MS-13 is already killing and raping here in the US in Satanic rituals. And even if not ritualistically, with unspeakable violence.
The middle eastern people who once migrated to Mexico and Latin-American were mainly Christians and Jews fleeing the oppression of Islam. Now there are many Islamic Extremists who are coming to the Americas to raise money for Jihad. In a marriage made in hell, Jihadists and Latin Drug dealers are working together. Middle Eastern drug dealers in Mexico and Latin America now run the heroin trade to Spain and Western Europe.
2. Repeal of Individual Mandate
Trump has kept his promise to abolish the mandatory tax penalty for not buying Obamacare. The most basic Obamacare with an $8,000 deductible would cost me over $12,000 a year or a fine of $1,200. I live a very healthy lifestyle and over the past 40 years, have averaged spending $300 a year or less on health. I chose not to have insurance but rather started my own medical savings account.
3. Stronger Negotiations for the U.S.
Trump understands negotiations. The socialist Democrats only understand raising taxes and buying votes with welfare. They are clueless as to how to negotiate. Pres. Obama was an idiot when it came to negotiations. He would give away the cake to get a burned candle.
Trump continues to even the playing field on international trade. We have been played for fools for too long.  Trump is exposing the self-serving politicians in the bag for the Military Industrial Complex. He is trying to get us out of the insane wars we are in and trying to prevent our being sucked into these bloody wars that do not benefit the USA again.
4. Tax Relief Funding
In my art & design business, I depend on people having money to spend on remodeling, new construction and/or decorating. Trump’s tax relief is giving people money to spend. Trump has brought to light the advantages of low taxes and less regulation to stimulate the economy and to attract business.
I have mixed emotions on this. The businesses and people are flocking toTexas by the thousands daily due to the lower taxes and friendlier business climate. Unfortunate many of these people are bringing their leftist PC ideas with them. If they vote in the Socialist Democrats here in Texas, they will kill the goose that laid the golden egg.
It has already happened in some districts.
5. Inspirational Example
Trump has provided a heroic example of how to keep focused on your goals despite being viciously and vulgarly attacked 24/7 by the combined forces of the Democrats, media, entertainment, never Trump rhinos, etc..
Somehow, he gets up each day and makes progress despite all the hate being thrown his way.
6. Brings America Together
The nation is clearly and perhaps irreparably divided between Trump haters and those of us who see the progress that Trump is making. This presents some awkward social challenges. While many of us on different sides avoided each other for the past couple of years, we are beginning to associate again with the unspoken agreement to avoid all politics and stick to common values-like good wine

731,What immigrants can teach Natural American Citizens,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/economy/what-immigrants-can-teach-natural-american-citizens/,"What is the most important thing immigrants can teach Americans? Gratitude. The key to happiness is not the amount of material goods. It’s appreciating what you have.
There is a Russian saying that goes “We don’t value what we have but cry when it’s lost.” Everything has some sort of value, although we might forget exactly how valuable something is until it’s gone. There are so many things in life that Americans just take for granted because they have never experienced what it’s like to be without them…
My family did not have a vacuum cleaner. Once a week, I would roll the carpet up and carry it outside. I would put it on a metal bar and then hit the carpet with a stick to get the dust out. The dust would go everywhere. All over my clothes. All over my hair. Into my eyes. Into my mouth. I would stand there coughing, beating the carpet with the stick until all the dust came out. It was awful. After I was done, I would roll it up, place it on the ground, and climb on top of the metal bar. I would hang upside-down, swinging up and down like a monkey, having the time of my life. I had no fear of falling. It was just a metal bar designed for beating the dust out of carpets. But for me, it was freedom.
My family did not have a washer or a dryer. All of our clothes were washed in a bath tub. Water first had to be heated in a big pot on the stove. Then we had to use our hands to rub all the clothes and sheets with soap. A lot of strength was required to ring them out. They were carried outside to dry. In winter, the clothes would get frozen solid as a rock. They had to be thawed out with iron that weighed several pounds. We didn’t have a dishwasher either. Again, water had to be heated in a pot, then all the dishes soaped. Then more water had to be heated to rinse them. Plastic bags were not disposable. They had to be washed and dried on a string. House chores took forever.
Since we didn’t have heating or hot water, we went to public bath houses. There were a lot of people there in one big room. We had to undress and then stand in line for the hot water faucet holding our buckets. When it was my turn, I filled the bucket up with hot water. I then used a small piece of terribly smelly soap to wash myself in front of the line of naked women and pour the warm water from the bucket to rinse. There were no hair dryers, so hair had to be towel-dried and then wrapped in a shawl. I was always cold when I was a kid. When I came to the United States, I took a thirty-minute hot shower. It was one of the happiest moments in my life. The pleasure never went away.
Do you think about all the things that make your life easier? Have you thought about how your life would be without them? Have you ever thanked your washer and dryer? How about your dishwasher? Do you appreciate your ability to take a hot shower?
Depending on the day, there are some things that are obviously appreciated. You can’t help but be grateful for your car when it is pouring rain outside and you have to get to work. You are clearly thankful for your bed at the end of a long, exhausting day when you just collapse onto the soft mattress and wrap yourself up in the warm blanket. But there are so many other things in your life that make such an enormous difference, you might not even be able to imagine what it would be like without them. It’s hard to think of having to walk for miles to get clean water or having to spend hours sewing an outfit that will be the only thing you wear for the next year. Fortunately, many of us don’t have to go through those experiences, but other people aren’t so lucky. You have no idea how life changing something like heating and air conditioning can be for someone who has never had that type of luxury before.
Take the time to appreciate what you have. Don’t wait until what you have is gone to be thankful for all the little things in life. You shouldn’t have to wait until a pipe bursts to be grateful for the hot running water in your house. Be grateful now! Next time you do laundry, tell your washer and dryer thank you for taking such good care of your clothes. When you take a shower, thank it for washing away the dirt and stress that your body accumulates every day. Pet the wheel in your car the next time you drive it. It might sound silly at first, but just try it. See how being thankful for the little things will open up your eyes to the world around you. You’ll start seeing how sweet your life really is and start appreciating all the good things in it. Being able to do this will make the bitter moments so much easier to handle. Learn to love everything around you. Don’t be afraid to express that love. Everybody loves a nice compliment, even your household appliances!
What else can immigrants teach Americans? Mindfulness. Food is so integrated into our daily routine that often times we don’t really think about it. We aren’t mindful about what we put in our bodies because why should we? We don’t have to worry about food all that much. But that frame of mind can lead down a very slippery slope…
Before I came to America, food and scarcity were synonyms. There was no overindulging. You did not waste food. In fact, there wasn’t even food available to waste. Everything was used as much as it could be. My mom cooked a typical Russian dinner. She took a bunch of bones, boiled them to make a bone broth, then added cabbage and potatoes. We ate this soup and cracked the bones open to eat the marrow inside the bones.
The special food that added some flavor to a meal had to be very carefully rationed out and sparsely used. For the bone soup, each family member added a teaspoon of sour cream. One time when I was nine, I took the jar of the sour cream from the refrigerator and ate half of the jar. I just could not stop. It was so delicious and never before did I get to eat more than a tiny little teaspoon. I kept eating and eating and I ate the portions of other family members. I was severely punished. You weren’t supposed to overindulge like that.
The temptation to indulge was very difficult to overcome. One time, around the same age as the sour cream incident, I visited a friend’s house. She had rich parents and they proudly displayed little figures of animals made from marzipan (sweet almond paste) in their glass cupboards. When my friend was in another room, I moved the glass and smelled the little figures. The smell was intoxicating. It promised deliciousness. I was fighting the urge to eat one of the animals. Finally, I pinched the tail off a squirrel and immediately put it in my mouth. It tasted even better than I had imagined. I hurriedly closed the glass and walked away. The taste of sweet almond still on my tongue. I savored it with the overwhelming bitter feeling of guilt. I only hoped that no one would find out and my friend would not get into trouble. Luckily no one noticed. But to this day I associate marzipan with guilty pleasure.
Most of the delicious food I remember from my childhood was only available once a year: for the New Year’s celebration. Tangerines are still connected in my mind to the holiday season. This was the only time they were available. Strawberries during winter? Never happened. Pineapple? Never tried it. There was a poem about pineapple: “Eat pineapples, chew on quail. Your last day is coming, millionaire.” I couldn’t even imagine what it tasted like, it was so inconceivable that I would ever be able to eat pineapple in Russia. When I first tried pineapple in the United States, it tasted as good as, if not better than, the marzipan.
When I was in college in Russia, I had three meals a day. Boiled noodles for each meal. When I came to the United States, I went to a grocery store and cried from the overwhelming variety of food that I never knew existed. My American college professor took me to my first dinner in America to an Italian restaurant. He wanted to order some pasta and I said I did not want anything. There was no way I would eat another meal of noodles. We went to a different restaurant. The menu looked promising and I ordered three entrees. You see, Russian restaurants are for entertainment, not for eating. A typical plate is the size of your palm. I hadn’t eaten for over twenty-four hours and was starving by the time we got to the restaurant. “Are you sure you will be able to eat three entrees?” my professor asked. “YES!” I immediately replied, “I am very hungry.” In Russia, three entrees would’ve been no problem with how hungry I was. When the waiter brought three plates, each the size of a small tray, I panicked. There were no “to go boxes” in Russia, so I thought all this food would be wasted. Luckily my professor explained that I could take all this food with me and finish it the next day.
Over the next few months I bought every can and every box of cookies I saw in the store. There was so much delicious food available to me! Never before could I buy an entire box of Oreos and eat all of them by myself. I no longer had to eat only one teaspoon of sour cream. I could buy a giant piece of marzipan and shove all of it in my mouth. I could buy a pineapple. I could have strawberries in the winter. All of this food was suddenly right in front of me, and I couldn’t help but overindulge. I gained twenty pounds. Eventually, after having satisfied the deprived Russian girl inside of me, I realized that more did not mean better and went back to small healthy meals. Although I still overindulge in pineapple, the simple food of the millionaires.
Are you mindful of the food you eat? How often do you give in to indulgences? Do you find yourself overeating just because you can? How much pleasure do you actually gain from your food? Do you savor every bite you eat?
The amount of food choices available in today’s society is incredible. For breakfast, you can have eggs or bacon or toast or bagels or cereal or waffles or fruit or a bunch of other different things. And depending on what you choose, there are even more choices to make. You can have your eggs scrambled or sunny side up, apples or oranges for your fruit, Frosted Flakes or Cheerios for your cereal. And this is just the first meal of the day! So how do you choose between all of these options? Well, you don’t. You go to a restaurant and your meal will come with two different sides so you can try everything and feel absolutely stuffed when you’re done. You go to the grocery store and buy three different types of cookies because they might all be delicious and you have to try them all. You try to eat as much as you can because well…you can. Nothing is stopping you from doing that. And then suddenly you’ve gained twenty pounds, food becomes associated with guilt and regret, and you’ve lost the pleasure of savoring every bite.
The solution to this is mindfulness. That’s it! Start by really thinking about the food you’re eating. Do you actually enjoy your lunch? No? Then try something different! Think about what your favorite foods are. Focus on fresh, healthy food that you genuinely enjoy. The taste of delicious strawberries or a juicy peach. The satisfying crunch of fresh carrots or a handful of nuts. Slowly start replacing the unhealthy processed foods that make you feel gross afterwards with fresh fruits and vegetables. Don’t like the bitter taste of dandelion greens or arugula? Blend them into a fruit smoothie. You’ll barely taste them and still enjoy the nutritional benefits while drinking a sweet delicious smoothie. Start eating more healthy food, and soon you’ll find that your cravings for sugary, processed, fatty foods have disappeared.
But it isn’t just about what you eat. It’s about how you eat and how much you eat. Don’t try to finish every meal as fast as you can. Take the time to savor every bite. Chew it carefully. Think about what you’re eating. Avoid eating in front of the TV or other things that will distract you from your food. Enjoy every little bit of your meal and appreciate the fresh food that is available to you. Each time I eat a pineapple, I savor the sweet, juicy taste and think about how lucky I am to enjoy such a delicious fruit.
Then, as you’re thinking about what you’re eating, listen to your body. Stop eating once you start feeling full. Don’t overdo it. Eat however much is necessary to satisfy your hunger and then stop. Just because you can eat a lot doesn’t mean you should. Trust me, you’ll feel a lot more satisfied after your meal if you take the time to savor every bite, put good things in your body, and not eat so much that you feel like you can’t move afterwards.
It’s okay to indulge from time to time. I have a weakness for tiramisu, mango cheesecake, and (unsurprisingly) marzipan. But you can indulge in moderation. Eat a small piece of your favorite dessert from time to time, or allow yourself an indulgence for a special occasion. If I’ve learned anything from my time in Russia and in America, it’s that depriving yourself of everything is just as bad as allowing yourself to indulge in everything. It’s all about balance. Don’t eat every sweet dessert that comes your way, but don’t torture yourself by never allowing yourself anything. These temptations will also become a lot more manageable when you savor every bite. Once you start gaining pleasure from eating your everyday meals, you’ll no longer have this void that you’ll want to fill with unhealthy foods. Soon your kale salad will be the most delicious thing in the world and you’ll find yourself craving it. This might sound crazy now, but it’s incredible how much of a difference mindfulness makes.

732,Trump 2019 State of the Union Address: Full Transcript,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/trump-2019-state-of-the-union-address-full-transcript/,"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States and my fellow Americans:
We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential.  As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.
Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation.  
The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda.  It’s the agenda of the American people.
Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation’s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America’s interests first.
There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage, together, to seize it.    Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.
This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America’s mission and the power of American pride.
In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the “Great Crusade” — the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II.    On D-Day, June 6th, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those incredible heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik.    Please. Gentlemen, we salute you.
In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon.  Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. Thank you, Buzz. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.  
In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, redefined the middle class, and, when you get down to it, there’s nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America.    Now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach.
We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.  
But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.  
Together, we can break decades of political stalemate.  We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.  The decision is ours to make.
We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.
Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.  
Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.
In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom — a boom that has rarely been seen before.  There’s been nothing like it. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and, importantly, added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs — something which almost everyone said was impossible to do.  But the fact is, we are just getting started.
Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue-collar workers, who I promised to fight for.  They’re growing faster than anyone else thought possible. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps.    The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office. And we are considered, far and away, the hottest economy anywhere in the world.  Not even close.
Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century.    African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded.    Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in the history of our country — 157 million people at work.  
We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.  
We virtually ended the estate tax — or death tax, as it is often called — on small businesses for ranchers and also for family farms.  
We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty.    And to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed, very importantly, Right to Try.  
My administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure.    Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations.
And we have unleashed a revolution in American energy.  The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.    And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.
After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on Earth, by far, and America America is again winning each and every day.  
Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.
On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone — almost double the number expected.    An economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.  
If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.  It just doesn’t work that way.
We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.  This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate.  In some cases, years and years waiting. Not right. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our country.
Now is the time for bipartisan action.  Believe it or not, we have already proven that that’s possible.
In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms.  And after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.
And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform.  They said it couldn’t be done.
Last year, I heard, through friends, the story of Alice Johnson.  I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender.  Over the next 22 years, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population, and far beyond.
Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing, and the need to remedy this total injustice.  She served almost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of her life.
In June, I commuted Alice’s sentence.  When I saw Alice’s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did something right.  Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific woman. Terrific. Alice, please.
Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.  Thank you very much, Alice. Thank you very much.
Inspired by stories like Alice’s, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the FIRST STEP Act into law.  Big deal. It’s a big deal.
This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community.  The FIRST STEP Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now states across the country are following our lead.  America is a nation that believes in redemption.
We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee.  In 1996, at the age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses.  Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow inmates.
Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the FIRST STEP Act.    Matthew, please. Thank you, Matthew. Welcome home.
Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.  Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous southern border.
Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.  
As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States.  We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection.  I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for this tremendous onslaught.
This is a moral issue.  The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial wellbeing of all America.  We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who followed the rules and respected our laws.  Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways.
I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.  
Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration.  Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls, and gates, and guards.
Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded you can’t get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.  Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is actually very cruel.
One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.  Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.  Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our southern border.  Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands.  But until we secure our border, they’re going to keep streaming right back in.
Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.  I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads, and families. No one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to endure.
Here tonight is Debra Bissell.  Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien.  They were in their eighties, and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter Heather, and great-granddaughter Madison.
To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand.  Few can understand your pain. Thank you. And thank you for being here.  Thank you very much.
I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should never happen again.  Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders.
We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez.  When Elvin thank you.
When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic.  At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.
Elvin says that, “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve [really] done my job.”  Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.    Thank you, Elvin.
We will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that I will never abolish our heroes from ICE.  Thank you.
My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border.  It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.
In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper wall never got built.  I will get it built.
This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall.  It will be deployed in the areas identified by the border agents as having the greatest need.  And these agents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.
San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country.  In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.
The border city of El Paso, Texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities.  Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives.
So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.
As we work to defend our people’s safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.  No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year.  
You weren’t supposed to do that.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.  
Don’t sit yet.  You’re going to like this.  (Laughter.)
And exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.  
That’s great.  Really great. And congratulations.  That’s great.
As part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first-ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.
To build on thank you.  To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount: reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.  So bad.
We are now making it clear to China that, after years of targeting our industries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.    Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars.
But I don’t blame China for taking advantage of us; I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen.  I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.    Thank you.
Another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.  I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by the signing of NAFTA.  For years, politicians promised them they would renegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now.
Our new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers like they haven’t had delivered to for a long time.  I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words: “Made in the USA.”  
Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us.  
Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure.  
I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill, and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting-edge industries of the future.  This is not an option. This is a necessity.
The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, and to protect patients with preexisting conditions.  
Already, as a result of my administration’s efforts, in 2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.  
But we must do more.  It’s unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.  This is wrong, this is unfair, and together we will stop it — and we’ll stop it fast.
I am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients, finally.  
We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down.  
No force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom.  In recent years in recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.  Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years.  We have made incredible strides. Incredible. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.
Tonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.  
Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline.  Every birthday hi, Grace. (Laughter.) Every birthday since she was four, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital.  She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. That’s what happened.
Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment.  At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer.    When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered — they loved her; they still love her — with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: “Last day of chemo.”    Thank you very much, Grace. You are a great inspiration to everyone in this room. Thank you very much.
Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades.  My budget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research.
To help support working parents, the time has come to pass School Choice for Americans’ children.    I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.  
There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days.  Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments from birth.  These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.
To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb.  
Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.    And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God.
The final part of my agenda is to protect American security.  Over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military, with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.
We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.    Finally. Finally. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of NATO.  But now we have secured, over the last couple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending from our NATO Allies.    They said it couldn’t be done.
As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system.
Under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America’s interests.
For example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability.  While we followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. It’s been going on for many years. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.
Perhaps we really have no choice.  Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can’t — in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.  
As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula.  Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months.  If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea.  
Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one.  Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27th and 28th in Vietnam.
Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela and its new President, Juan Guaidó.  
We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom, and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.  
Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country.
 America was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination, and control.    We are born free and we will stay free.
Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.  
 One of the most complex set of challenges we face, and have for many years, is in the Middle East.  Our approach is based on principled realism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress.  For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel, and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.  
Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years.  In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded.  We have spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.
As a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach.  Great nations do not fight endless wars.
When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria — just two years ago.  Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters.
Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.
I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach — if possible — a political settlement in Afghanistan.  The opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor. And thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict.  
In Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban.  As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop’s presence and focus on counterterrorism.  And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism.
We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement, but we do know that, after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.  And the other side would like to do the same thing. It’s time.
Above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation’s power and will to defend our people.  Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the USS Cole. And last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that attack.
We are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost.  Tom, we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole. Thank you, Tom.
My administration has acted decisively to confront the world’s leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.  It is a radical regime. They do bad, bad things.
To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.  
And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by us on a country.
We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants “Death to America” and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.    We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.
Just months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.  SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. And he was very successful. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery, and he is going in for many more.  But he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson, please. Thank you. We are forever grateful. Thank you very much.
Tonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet.  He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall, more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps.  Today is Judah’s 81st birthday.
Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp.  Suddenly, the train screeched to a very strong halt. A soldier appeared. Judah’s family braced for the absolute worst. Then, his father cried out with joy, “It’s the Americans! It’s the Americans!”    Thank you.
A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau.  He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks.  “To me,” Joshua recalls, “the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.”  They came down from Heaven.
I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War.  One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman’s story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau.    He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.
Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight, seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom.  Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. Thank you.
When American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.
They did not know if they would survive the hour.  They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail.  Their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn.
Why did they do it?  They did it for America.  They did it for us.
Everything that has come since — our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice — all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.
Think of this Capitol.  Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, and defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.
Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic.  You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California.  Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.
What will we do with this moment?  How will we be remembered?
I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us.  Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await.  Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.
We must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them.
We must choose whether we squander our great inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans.
We do the incredible.  We defy the impossible.  We conquer the unknown.
This is the time to reignite the American imagination.  This is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star.  This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.
This is our future, our fate, and our choice to make.  I am asking you to choose greatness.
No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.
We must keep America first in our hearts.  We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America’s destiny that one nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise, and the light and the glory, among all the nations of the world.
Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much. Thank you.

733,Will the Wall Work?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/will-the-wall-work/,"The Debate
Possibly the most trending topic of post-2018 was the Wall debate: Should America build a wall to curb immigration? More importantly, though, should be the question: Will the wall work? There’s no point in spending 5+ billion dollars on a structure that does nothing. Here’s how the two sides think about the effectiveness of the wall.
The Democrat
Featuring: Winston Wang, Public Speaker, CEO
Republicans will tell you: A wall will make the jobs of border patrol agents. It works in China. It’s not immoral. However, there are many flaws in their logic. First off, China and Israel face different circumstances than those in the United States. Most people in China are trying to leave the country, not get in. Hundreds of thousands of people want to get into the US, including criminal gangs, but also hard-working immigrants who seek a better life. China is just not as attractive to them, therefore fewer resources are needed to curb immigration.
Furthermore, China handles immigration very differently. There are very strict policies and it is extremely hard to get permanent resident status. People caught crossing the border illegally are shot on sight. There is no, “I seek asylum” in China.
A wall is also immoral. The United States has set an example for other countries in many places. What message are we sending to the world if we wall our Mexico border? More importantly, what message are we sending to Mexico? Essentially, we are distancing ourselves for Mexico. While they haven’t exactly been our best ally, it’s important to maintain good relations with Mexico.
Even more, a wall won’t keep those who really want to get in, that is, the terrorist and drug dealers. What keeps them from using some sort of weapon to destroy or damage the wall? No structure is indestructible, and the United States will only be wasting more money on fixing the wall.
Although it’s true that a wall might stop some immigrants, it won’t make up for its cost. There are many other ways to get in the United States. For example, you can get a travel visa and then never leave. You can give birth to a baby in the U.S. and use the baby as an “anchor.”
Effectiveness aside, let’s say that we do build a wall and drastically curb immigration. This would harm our economy. According to Small Business Administration, immigrants are more likely to start a business compared to native citizens. These businesses create jobs for other people. Furthermore, immigrants improve our workforce. Since there are more people competing for a job, everyone needs to work harder, which make our workforce better and in turn grows our economy. We need more immigrants, not less.

The Democrats are lying yet again, just like they lied about if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor, if you like your plan you can keep your plan. Afterward, the architect of Obamacare was interviewed in the media and he actually stated that we counted on the stupidity of the American people to get the bill passed. (https://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/11/10/obamacare-architect-yeah-we-lied-to-the-stupid-american-people-n1916605)The Dems would tell you that walls don’t work. The Great Wall of China is still working. The wall around Jerusalem is working. Walls definitely work. The Dems claim that the walls are immoral. Now they don’t bother to explain how walls are immoral. They just expect you to believe them and if you don’t then, of course, you are a racist.
The real reason that the Dems want undocumented immigrants into our country is that they get votes and are counting on illegal votes to give them a majority. Texas just found over 100,000 illegal votes. Sanctuary Cities give undocumented immigrants a driver’s license and based upon that they register them to vote (motor vote law). This violates our Constitution and Trump tried to eliminate Federal Subsidies to sanctuary cities but was overturned by a liberal judge.
Other states have found a lot of dead people still on their voter rolls and yet miraculously the dead are still voting. States try to purge their voter rolls and the Dems still scream racism. We tried to insist that you show a valid ID AND YOU GUESSED IT THE DEMS STILL SCREAMED RACISM! Ironically they don’t scream racism over having to show a valid ID to buy booze, cigarettes, check into a motel, buy an airline ticket, a bus ticket, a train ticket, to have a bank account but to vote it is completely racist and claiming that we are discriminating against poor black voters.
The Dems have for years tried to get hate speech legislation passed to no avail. I would love it if that legislation passed because Democrats are the most egregious offenders of that black art. Look no further than Maxime Waters having her followers disturbing the peace and have their followers run people out of restaurants.
The Dems are acting like a toddler suffering through the terrible twos and that is just the level that they are behaving as. Conservatives need to stop acting like schoolyard nerds who daily have their lunch money stolen by the Dem bullies and fight back like Trump.
By not fighting back we are losing more and more of the population and the DEMS are fighting hard for full-blown socialism. I spent two years in Europe watching up close and personal and believe me socialism does not work, has never worked anywhere that it was tried, but the Dems are still pushing it. We need to start fighting back and take our country back before it is too late.
Now we are on the verge of legalizing killing babies right up to delivery several states. These babies are completely viable and completely capable of surviving outside the mother and instead are murdered inside the mother.

I did business on the Tex-Mex border for years, have friends and relatives who have/had ranches literally on the border and have had border agents/law enforcement for friends and neighbors.In a nutshell- Until we get sensible laws that actually punish border invaders and those who hire them, a wall is useless, border agents are just spinning their wheels and we are an internationally milk cow, dumping ground and joke.
The best solution once we get laws that actually benefit and protect the American people would be just a line in the sand and signs that
say “Trespassers will be shot” with sharpshooters to back them up.
A few good laws and a few bullets and problem solved.
However, since we are gutless and greedy, let the Democrats play humanitarian as they stuff the ballet box and Republicans play as if they care about security as they build a wall and hire undocumented immigrants.
And of course as the vote buying scumbags in Washington allow this unbridled invasion, we are being drowned in drugs, criminals, social problems, and cheap labor.
We should put our welfare bums to work and only allow immigrants who can make a positive contribution.
As it stands, we are repeating the Mariel Boat Lift fiasco of 1980 a thousand times over with Marielitos from around the world.

734,Texas Federal Judge Strikes Down Obamacare – What’s In Store?,https://www.thebipartisanpress.com/politics/texas-federal-judge-strikes-down-obamacare-whats-in-store/,"The Facts
After a lengthy lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor of the Texas Federal Court ruled that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, violated the constitution.
Since Congress removed the penalty for the Individual Mandate, a law that required everyone who could afford healthcare to purchase it or pay a fine, Judge O’Connor ruled that “The Court finds the Individual Mandate ‘is essential to’ and inseverable from ‘the other provisions’ of the ACA.”
The lawsuit stated that since the Supreme Court declared that the mandate was considered a tax, now that the tax had no penalty, it can not be considered a tax anymore, and therefore is a violation of the Constitution. O’Connor confirmed this and wrote that the mandate, “can no longer be sustained as an exercise of Congress’s tax power.”
Due to that fact that the Individual Mandate was ruled unconstitutional, the entire ACA act was also invalidated, because the judge deemed the Individual Mandate an unseverable part of the act.
While it is currently unclear what is to happen now, President Donald Trump backed the ruling on Twitter, saying “Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!”
Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2018
As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2018
Despite this loss, a group of states led by California is expected to appeal the ruling to the Fifth Court of Appeals.
If Obamacare is indeed repealed, it could leave millions of people uninsured, and would also mean that insurers wouldn’t need to cover patients with pre-existing conditions. While it is life-saving for some people, others have long contested the benefits of the act, citing increases in insurance premiums.
The Democrat
Featuring: Winston Wang, Public Speaker, CEO, @whatifhq
Many of the media outlets have portrayed the repeal as the end of the world. However, in reality, the repeal isn’t technically put in action yet. In the past, over 70 lawsuits have contested the integrity of Obamacare.ObamaCare has long been a controversial topic for many people. While many people rely on it to provide them with affordable healthcare and save their life, others see it as an extra burden.Many people are worried about how this ruling will affect them. For now, though, it won’t. This lawsuit will likely drag out for a very long time and maybe even end up in Supreme Court.What people need to know, though, is that even if ObamaCare is repealed, and Republicans try to find a way to create a new healthcare plan, they won’t be able to do anything they want, since the Democrats control the house. Under the constitution, both the House’s and the Senate’s agreement are required for a law to pass.One of the biggest thing that was in ObamaCare and will be repealed is the pre-existing conditions criteria. Under the current law, insurance providers must cover people who already have an existing condition. Covering existing conditions is not very attractive to insurers, because it requires them to pay part of the bill as soon as the plan starts.
If the pre-existing condition mandate is repealed along with the rest of ObamaCare, insurers may choose to not cover people with existing conditions. This means that some people won’t be able to pay hospital bills in full, and may cut out on treatment, which, in turn, can threaten their lives.
In the near future though, there is little need to worry about that.
The Republican
Featuring: Jonathan Lockwood, Republican political consultant, spokesman for over forty lawmakers, candidates and organizations
The first thing we should make sure people understand is that there will be no immediate changes to their health care. We must remind people that government forcing us to buy a product or service is not only unconstitutional and unpopular, but striking down the individual mandate can help ameliorate the so-called affordable care act’s burden on Americans.
For example, most millennials cannot afford to buy a solid health care plan that is really worth the money, so they buy lower-costing ACA-compliant plans that really do nothing for you unless you get hit by a tractor and somehow survive.
Why not spend your hard-earned money in a way that actually protects your health? Chief Justice Roberts explained, like Democrats, that the individual mandate is what fuels the rest of the law. Many Republicans will want to see the individual mandate be struck down, and for congressional Republicans to develop a plan to protect our health care system.
Republicans want to see more free-market policies advanced and signed into law to help solve this perpetual problem. Additionally, I think that policies can be advanced to solve these problems in statehouses across the country. If you can solve some of these problems at the state level, we can move past the partisan gridlock in Washington D.C.
People tend to think in partisan terms, like single-payer or free-market health care, but what we should do is think rationally and reasonably to fix problems. Too often, things are not addressed until they are a crisis. And, when people think in a partisan way, rather than an evidence-based way, people’s lives are put in jeopardy.
When Colorado extremists sought to receive a waiver from Obama and pushed state-level single-payer health care in Colorado in 2016, ballot proposal Amendment 69 commonly called ColoradoCare, I spearheaded the coalition against the proposal. I sounded the alarm for months before it got on the ballot. While other Republicans wanted to talk about the price tag, which I fundamentally believe fails to work with the electorate, I made sure to let Coloradans know the proposal would have jeopardized access to reproductive health care and my organization ran ads featuring a woman that said we shouldn’t let politicians get in between women and their doctors, that ColoradoCare restricted choice.
After publicizing this concern, and applying pressure on the left-wing groups, Planned Parenthood, ProgressNow and NARAL came out against the proposal. So did top Democrats. What an interesting coalition it was, but there were so many concerns with this poorly-crafted, ideologically and morally bankrupt vanity proposal, that virtually everyone was forced to recognize that this proposal was the wrong approach to health care reform.
No party is immune to blind partisanship. I think in today’s era it is important to know when to crank up the heat on rhetoric and how to use tools to advance a mission, and it takes people working together and understanding differing approaches and values. Health care policy is literally a matter of life and death, and we need to take it seriously.
